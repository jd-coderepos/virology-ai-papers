O.; Neuenschwander, S.; Malaspinas, A.-S.",Genomics,2021-11-30 00:00:00 UTC,"Owing to technological advances in ancient DNA, it is now possible to sequence viruses from the past to track down their origin and evolution. However, ancient DNA data is considerably more degraded and contaminated than modern data making the identification of ancient viral genomes particularly challenging. Several methods to characterise the modern microbiome (and, within this, the virome) have been developed; in particular, tools that assign sequenced reads to specific taxa in order to characterise the organisms present in a sample of interest. While these existing tools are routinely used in modern data, their performance when applied to ancient microbiome data to screen for ancient viruses remains unknown.

In this work, we conducted an extensive simulation study using public viral sequences to establish which tool is the most suitable to screen ancient samples for human DNA viruses. We compared the performance of four widely used classifiers, namely Centrifuge, Kraken2, DIAMOND and MetaPhlAn2, in correctly assigning sequencing reads to the corresponding viruses. To do so, we simulated reads by adding noise typical of ancient DNA to a set of publicly available human DNA viral sequences and to the human genome. We fragmented the DNA into different lengths, added sequencing error and C to T and G to A deamination substitutions at the read termini. Then we measured the resulting sensitivity and precision for all classifiers.

Across most simulations, more than 228 out of the 233 simulated viruses are recovered by Centrifuge, Kraken2 and DIAMOND, in contrast to MetaPhlAn2 which recovers only around one third. Overall, Centrifuge and Kraken2 have the best performance with the highest values of sensitivity and precision. We found that deamination damage has little impact on the performance of the classifiers, less than the sequencing error and the length of the reads. Since Centrifuge can handle short reads (in contrast to DIAMOND and Kraken2 with default settings) and since it achieves the highest sensitivity and precision at the species level across all the simulations performed, it is our recommended tool. Regardless of the tool used, our simulations indicate that, for ancient human studies, users should use strict filters to remove all reads of potential human origin. Finally, we recommend to verify which species are present in the database used, as it might happen that default databases lack sequences for viruses of interest.",10.1101/2021.04.30.442132,virology-agentic-ai.xlsx,"Benchmarking metagenomics classifiers on ancient viral DNA: a simulation study Owing to technological advances in ancient DNA, it is now possible to sequence viruses from the past to track down their origin and evolution.

R.; Luallen, R. J.",Microbiology,2022-02-28 00:00:00 UTC,"The intestines of wild Caenorhabditis nematodes are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms, including gut microbiome bacteria and pathogens, such as microsporidia and viruses. Because of the similarities between Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian intestinal cells, as well as the power of the C. elegans system, this host has emerged as a model system to study host intestine-microbe interactions in vivo. While it is possible to observe some aspects of these interactions with bright-field microscopy, it is difficult to accurately classify microbes and characterize the extent of colonization or infection without more precise tools.

This protocol introduces RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a tool used for the identification, visualization, and quantification of the microbes within the intestines of C. elegans. FISH probes that label the highly abundant small subunit ribosomal RNA can produce a bright signal for bacteria and microsporidian cells, and similar probes can be used to label viral RNA. FISH probes can be ordered from a commercial source as single-stranded DNA end-labeled with fluorophores. One limitation is that FISH may not provide robust signal against low copy targets, although signal can be boosted by using multiple probes (so-called  single-molecule FISH). FISH staining involves collecting colonized or infected animals, washing to eliminate external contamination, followed by fixation in either paraformaldehyde or acetone. After fixation, FISH probes are incubated with samples to allow for the hybridization of probes to the desired target. To remove excess background, the animals are washed again, and then examined on microscope slides or using automated approaches.

Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is discussed. The code is available for download at https://github.com/mriglobal/vorpal.",0

MethodIn our bacterial quantitative fitness analysis (baQFA), cultures are spotted in a predefined array on agar plates and photographed sequentially while growing. These time-lapse images are analysed using a purpose-built open source software to derive normalised image intensity values for each culture spot. Subsequently, a Gompertz growth model is fitted to these optical intensity values of each culture spot and fitness is calculated from parameters of the model. For image segmentation validation, we investigated the association between normalised intensity values and colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. To represent a range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, we used different strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with and without antimicrobial resistance.

For example, in metagenome analysis, binning is a typical type of DNA sequence classification. In order to classify sequences, it is necessary to define sequence features. The k-mer frequency, base composition, and alignment-based metrics are commonly used. In contrast, in the field of image recognition using machine learning, image classification is broadly divided into those based on shape and those based on style. A style matrix was introduced as a method of expressing the style of an image (e.g., color usage and texture).

For example, in metagenome analysis, binning is a typical type of DNA sequence classification. In order to classify sequences, it is necessary to define sequence features. The k-mer frequency, base composition, and alignment-based metrics are commonly used. In contrast, in the field of image recognition using machine learning, image classification is broadly divided into those based on shape and those based on style. A style matrix was introduced as a method of expressing the style of an image (e.g., color usage and texture).

K.",Bioinformatics,2021-10-16 00:00:00 UTC,"Synthetic otolith marks are used at hundreds of hatcheries throughout the Pacific Rim to record the release location of salmon. Each year, human readers examine tens of thousands of otolith samples to identify the marks in salmon that are caught. The data inform dynamic management practices that maximize allowable catch while preserving populations, and guide hatchery investments. However, the method is limited by the time required to process otoliths, the inability to distinguish between wild and un-marked hatchery fish, and in some cases classification processes are limited by the subjective decisions of human readers. Automated otolith reading using computer vision has the potential to improve on all three of these limitations. Our work advances the field of automated otolith reading through a novel otolith classification algorithm that uses two neural networks trained with an adversarial algorithm to achieve 93% classification accuracy between four hatchery marks and unmarked otoliths. The algorithm relies on hemisection images of the otolith exclusively: no additional biological data are needed. Our work demonstrates a novel technique with modest training requirements that achieves unprecedented accuracy. The method can be easily adopted in existing otolith labs, scaled to accommodate additional marks, and does not require tracking additional information about the fish that the otolith was retrieved from.

Author summaryMany fish harvested in commercial fisheries have a bone-like structure in their inner ear called an otolith. Otoliths are useful because as they grow changes in the fishs environment create unique patterns that can be interpreted years later--similar to the way tree rings can be used to determine a trees age and rate of growth in different seasons. Hatcheries use this phenomenon to create unique patterns in the otoliths of fish they release that identify their origin. Trained otolith ""readers"" examine tens of thousands of otolith samples as part of commercial fishery management every year. The data help resource managers protect returns to wild streams and help hatcheries track the survival rates of their releases. However, human reading is time consuming, limited in the types of patterns that can be identified and can be subjective. Applying modern machine learning techniques to otolith reading has the potential to improve on all of these challenges. We developed a computational method that identifies hatchery marks in digital images of salmon otoliths without human input.

Our work points to extensions towards predicting phenotypes of interest (e.g. antibiotic resistance, virulence), and suggests that sample size limitations may be less restrictive than previously thought for deep learning applications in biology, given appropriate use of data augmentation and transfer-learning tools.",0

Factors such as receptor binding, heat, and acidic pH can trigger capsid expansion in some enteroviruses. Here we show that fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin or neutral endosomal ionic conditions can independently prime CVA9 for expansion and genome release. Our results show that CVA9 treatment with albumin or endosomal ions generates a heterogeneous population of virions, which could be physically separated by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation and computationally by cryo-EM and image processing. We report cryo-EM structures of CVA9 A-particles obtained by albumin or endosomal ion treatment and a control non-expanded virion to 3.5, 3.3 and 2.9 [A] resolutions, respectively.

This process promotes the rapid spread of genetic information across lineages, typically in the form of clusters of genes referred to as genomic islands (GIs). Different types of GIs exist, often classified by the content of their cargo genes or their means of integration and mobility. Various computational methods have been devised to detect different types of GIs, but no single method currently is capable of detecting all GIs.

ResultsWe propose a method, which we call Shutter Island, that uses a deep learning model (Inception V3, widely used in computer vision) to detect genomic islands. The intrinsic value of deep learning methods lies in their ability to generalize. Via a technique called transfer learning, the model is pre-trained on a large generic dataset and then re-trained on images that we generate to represent genomic fragments. We demonstrate that this image-based approach generalizes better than the existing tools.

ConclusionsWe used a deep neural network and an image-based approach to detect the most out of the correct GI predictions made by other tools, in addition to making novel GI predictions.

Different types of GIs exist, often classified by the content of their cargo genes or their means of integration and mobility. Various computational methods have been devised to detect different types of GIs, but no single method currently is capable of detecting all GIs.

ResultsWe propose a method, which we call Shutter Island, that uses a deep learning model (Inception V3, widely used in computer vision) to detect genomic islands. The intrinsic value of deep learning methods lies in their ability to generalize. Via a technique called transfer learning, the model is pre-trained on a large generic dataset and then re-trained on images that we generate to represent genomic fragments. We demonstrate that this image-based approach generalizes better than the existing tools.

ConclusionsWe used a deep neural network and an image-based approach to detect the most out of the correct GI predictions made by other tools, in addition to making novel GI predictions. The fact that the deep neural network was retrained on only a limited number of GI datasets and then successfully generalized indicates that this approach could be applied to other problems in the field where data is still lacking or hard to curate.",0

Here, we investigated the role of innate immune pathways in tumor regression by performing experimental infections in genetically modified Drosophila that develop invasive neoplastic tumors. After quantifying tumor size, through image processing, and immune gene expression with transcriptomic analyses, we analyzed the link between tumor size and pathogen-induced immune responses thanks to a combination of statistical and mathematical modeling. Drosophila larvae infected with a naturally-occurring bacterium showed a smaller tumor size compared to controls and fungus-infected larvae, thanks to an increase expression of Imd and Toll pathways. Our mathematical model reinforces this idea by showing that repeated acute infection could results in an even higher decrease in tumor size. Thus, our study suggests that infectious agents can induce tumor regression through the alteration of innate immune responses. This phenomenon, currently neglected in oncology, could have major implications for the elaboration of new preventive and immunotherapeutic strategies.

However there is no experimental or computational approach to classify sequences of these two in culture-independent metavirome effectively, we present a new computational method DeePhage, which can directly and rapidly judge each read or contig as a virulent or temperate phage-derived fragment.

FindingsDeePhage utilizes a ""one-hot"" encoding form to have an overall and detailed representation of DNA sequences. Sequence signatures are detected via a deep learning algorithm, namely a convolutional neural network to extract valuable local features. DeePhage makes better performance than the most related method PHACTS. The accuracy of DeePhage on five-fold validation reach as high as 88%, nearly 30% higher than PHACTS.

Existing tools have limited capacity, as they can extract gene-disease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts.

ResultsIn this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based relation extraction method, which implements section filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene-disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting gene-disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22%, 30.30% and 29.24% higher than the best existing tools BeFree, DTMiner and BioBERT, respectively.

Existing tools have limited capacity, as they can extract gene-disease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts.

ResultsIn this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based relation extraction method, which implements section filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene-disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting gene-disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22%, 30.30% and 29.24% higher than the best existing tools BeFree, DTMiner and BioBERT, respectively.

Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences as references; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequences with machine learning and deep learning models.

ResultsWe propose INHERIT which uses a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based and alignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existing databases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods.

The high prediction performance of DeepLPI on the different datasets displayed its high capability of protein-ligand interaction in generalization, demonstrating that the DeepLPI has the potential to pinpoint new drug-target interactions and to find better destinations for proven drugs.",0

One favourable approach in cell immunotherapy is the use of neoantigens as targets that help our body immune system identify the cancer cells from healthy cells. Neoantigens, which are non-autologous proteins with individual specificity, are generated by non-synonymous mutations in the tumor cell genome. Owing to its strong immunogenicity and lack of expression in normal tissues, it is now an important target for tumor immunotherapy. Neoantigens are some form of special protein fragments excreted as a by-product on the surface of cancer cells during the DNA mutation at the tumour. In cancer immunotherapies, certain neoantigens which exist only on cancer cells elicit our white blood cells (bodys defender, anti-cancer T-cell) responses that fight the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. Personalized cancer vaccines therefore can be designed de novo for each individual patient, when the specific neoantigens are found to be relevant to his/her tumour. The vaccine which is usually coded in synthetic long peptides, RNA or DNA representing the neoantigens trigger an immune response in the body to destroy the cancer cells (tumour). The specific neoantigens can be found by a complex process of biopsy and genome sequencing. Alternatively, modern technologies nowadays tap on AI to predict the right neoantigen candidates using algorithms. However, determining the binding and non-binding of neoantigens on T-cell receptors (TCR) is a challenging computational task due to its very large search space.

ObjectiveTo enhance the efficiency and accuracy of traditional deep learning tools, for serving the same purpose of finding potential responsiveness to immunotherapy through correctly predicted neoantigens. It is known that deep learning is possible to explore which novel neoantigens bind to T-cell receptors and which ones dont. The exploration may be technically expensive and time-consuming since deep learning is an inherently computational method. one can use putative neoantigen peptide sequences to guide personalized cancer vaccines design.

Based on the patterns of sequence formation, a nested structure of bidirectional long-short term memory neural network called local information module is used to extract context-based features around every residue.

Different virulence factors (VFs) work in concert to enable pathogenic bacteria to successfully adhere, reproduce and cause damage to host cells, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) allow pathogens to evade otherwise curable treatments. To understand the causal relationship between microbiome composition, function and disease, both VFs and ARGs in microbial data must be identified. Most existing computational models cannot simultaneously identify VFs or ARGs, hindering the related research. The best hit approaches are currently the main tools to identify VFs and ARGs concurrently; yet they usually have high false-negative rates and are very sensitive to the cut-off thresholds. In this work, we proposed a hybrid computational framework called HyperVR to predict VFs and ARGs at the same time. Specifically, HyperVR integrates key genetic features and then stacks classical ensemble learning methods and deep learning for training and prediction. HyperVR accurately predicts VFs, ARGs and negative genes (neither VFs nor ARGs) simultaneously, with both high precision (>0.91) and recall (>0.91) rates. Also, HyperVR keeps the flexibility to predict VFs or ARGs individually.

Different virulence factors (VFs) work in concert to enable pathogenic bacteria to successfully adhere, reproduce and cause damage to host cells, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) allow pathogens to evade otherwise curable treatments. To understand the causal relationship between microbiome composition, function and disease, both VFs and ARGs in microbial data must be identified. Most existing computational models cannot simultaneously identify VFs or ARGs, hindering the related research. The best hit approaches are currently the main tools to identify VFs and ARGs concurrently; yet they usually have high false-negative rates and are very sensitive to the cut-off thresholds. In this work, we proposed a hybrid computational framework called HyperVR to predict VFs and ARGs at the same time. Specifically, HyperVR integrates key genetic features and then stacks classical ensemble learning methods and deep learning for training and prediction. HyperVR accurately predicts VFs, ARGs and negative genes (neither VFs nor ARGs) simultaneously, with both high precision (>0.91) and recall (>0.91) rates. Also, HyperVR keeps the flexibility to predict VFs or ARGs individually.

In addition, virus-like particles (VLPs) open novel opportunities to deliver therapeutic compounds to targeted cell types and tissues. Given our incomplete knowledge of virus-host interactions on one hand and the cost and time associated with experimental procedures on the other, we here propose a novel deep learning approach to predict virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Our method (Siamese Tailored deep sequence Embedding of Proteins - STEP) is based on recent deep protein sequence embedding techniques, which we integrate into a Siamese neural network architecture. After evaluating the high prediction performance of STEP in comparison to an existing method, we apply it to two use cases, SARS-CoV-2 and John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), to predict virus protein to human host interactions. For the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein our method predicts an interaction with the sigma 2 receptor, which has been suggested as a drug target. As a second use case, we apply STEP to predict interactions of the JCV VP1 protein showing an enrichment of PPIs with neurotransmitters, which are known to function as an entry point of the virus into glial brain cells. In both cases we demonstrate how recent techniques from the field of Explainable AI (XAI) can be employed to identify those parts of a pair of sequences, which most likely contribute to the protein-protein interaction. Altogether our work highlights the potential of deep sequence embedding techniques originating from the field of natural language processing as well as XAI methods for the analysis of biological sequences.

We provide continually updated escape scores for all current strains of SARS-CoV-2 and predict likely additional mutations to forecast emerging strains as a tool for ongoing vaccine development (evescape.org).",0

SUMMARY ANSWERA deep morphological signature (DMS) generated by deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis can identify the ploidy state of inner cell mass (ICM) in the mouse blastocyst-stage embryo.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYThe presence of aneuploidy - a deviation from the expected number of chromosomes - is predicted to cause early pregnancy loss or congenital disorders. To date, available techniques to detect embryo aneuploidy in IVF clinics involve an invasive biopsy of trophectoderm cells or a non-invasive analysis of cell-free DNA from spent media. These approaches, however, are not specific to the ICM and will consequently not always give an accurate indication of the presence of aneuploid cells with known ploidy therein.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThe effect of aneuploidy on the morphology of ICMs from mouse embryos was studied using images taken using a standard brightfield microscope. Aneuploidy was induced using the spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor, reversine (n = 13 euploid and n = 9 aneuploid). The morphology of primary human fibroblast cells with known ploidy was also assessed.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSTwo models were applied to investigate whether the morphological details captured by brightfield microscopy could be used to identify aneuploidy. First, primary human fibroblasts with known karyotypes (two euploid and trisomy: 21, 18, 13, 15, 22, XXX and XXY) were imaged.

SUMMARY ANSWERA deep morphological signature (DMS) generated by deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis can identify the ploidy state of inner cell mass (ICM) in the mouse blastocyst-stage embryo.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYThe presence of aneuploidy - a deviation from the expected number of chromosomes - is predicted to cause early pregnancy loss or congenital disorders. To date, available techniques to detect embryo aneuploidy in IVF clinics involve an invasive biopsy of trophectoderm cells or a non-invasive analysis of cell-free DNA from spent media. These approaches, however, are not specific to the ICM and will consequently not always give an accurate indication of the presence of aneuploid cells with known ploidy therein.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONThe effect of aneuploidy on the morphology of ICMs from mouse embryos was studied using images taken using a standard brightfield microscope. Aneuploidy was induced using the spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor, reversine (n = 13 euploid and n = 9 aneuploid). The morphology of primary human fibroblast cells with known ploidy was also assessed.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSTwo models were applied to investigate whether the morphological details captured by brightfield microscopy could be used to identify aneuploidy. First, primary human fibroblasts with known karyotypes (two euploid and trisomy: 21, 18, 13, 15, 22, XXX and XXY) were imaged. An advanced methodology of deep learning followed by swarm intelligence and discriminative analysis was used to train a deep morphological signature (DMS). Testing of the DMS demonstrated that there are common cellular features across different forms of aneuploidy detectable by this approach. Second, the same approach was applied to ICM images from control and reversine treated embryos. Karyotype of ICMs was confirmed by mechanical dissection and whole genome sequencing.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEThe DMS for discriminating euploid and aneuploid fibroblasts had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.89. The presence of aneuploidy also had a strong impact on ICM morphology (AUC-ROC = 0.98).

We aimed to investigate deep learning-based machine learning algorithms to classify COVID-19 related publications to help scale-up the epidemiological curation process.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, five different pre-trained deep learning-based language models were fine-tuned on a dataset of 6,365 publications manually classified into two classes, three subclasses and 22 sub-subclasses relevant for epidemiological triage purposes.

ResultsThe ensemble model significantly outperformed the standalone classifiers, achieving a F1-score of 89.2 at the class level of the classification task.

D.; Yu, H.",Bioinformatics,2023-01-28 00:00:00 UTC,"Drug-target interaction prediction is a crucial step in drug development, discovery, and repurposing. Due to the tremendous combinatorial search space of all drug-protein pairs, machine learning algorithms have been utilized to facilitate the identification of novel drug-target interactions. Deep learning, known as a powerful learning system, has recently shown superior performance to traditional machine learning in many biological and biomedical areas. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning model, DeepERA, to identify drug-target interactions based on heterogeneous data. This model assembles three independent feature embedding modules (intrinsic embedding, relational embedding, and annotation embedding) which each represent different attributes of the dataset and jointly contribute to the comprehensive predictions. This is the first work that, to our knowledge, applied deep learning models to learn each intrinsic features, relational features, and annotation features and combine them to predict drug-protein interactions. Our results showed that DeepERA outperformed other deep learning approaches proposed recently.

Due to the tremendous combinatorial search space of all drug-protein pairs, machine learning algorithms have been utilized to facilitate the identification of novel drug-target interactions. Deep learning, known as a powerful learning system, has recently shown superior performance to traditional machine learning in many biological and biomedical areas. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end deep learning model, DeepERA, to identify drug-target interactions based on heterogeneous data. This model assembles three independent feature embedding modules (intrinsic embedding, relational embedding, and annotation embedding) which each represent different attributes of the dataset and jointly contribute to the comprehensive predictions. This is the first work that, to our knowledge, applied deep learning models to learn each intrinsic features, relational features, and annotation features and combine them to predict drug-protein interactions. Our results showed that DeepERA outperformed other deep learning approaches proposed recently.

Despite its potential for the study of microbiomes, significant challenges remain in data analysis, including the creation of a sample-specific protein sequence database as the taxonomic composition of soil is often unknown. Almost all metaproteome analysis tools require this database and their accuracy and sensitivity suffer when the database is incomplete or contains extraneous sequences from organisms which are not present. Here, we leverage a de novo peptide sequencing approach to identify sample composition directly from metaproteomic data. First, we created a deep learning model, Kaiko, to predict the peptide sequences from mass spectrometry data, and trained it on 5 million peptide-spectrum matches from 55 phylogenetically diverse bacteria. After training, Kaiko successfully identified unsequenced soil isolates directly from proteomics data. Finally, we created a pipeline for metaproteome database generation using Kaiko. We tested the pipeline on native soils collected in Kansas, showing that the de novo sequencing model can be employed to construct the sample-specific protein database instead of relying on (un)matched metagenomes. Our pipeline identified all highly abundant taxa from 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of the soil samples and also uncovered several additional species which were strongly represented only in proteomic data.

Significance StatementProteomic characterization of environmental samples, or metaproteomics, reveals microbial activity critical to our understanding of climate, nutrient cycling and human health. Metaproteomic samples originate from diverse environs, such as soil and oceans. One option for data analysis is a de novo interpretation of the mass spectra. Unfortunately, the current generation of de novo algorithms were primarily trained on data originating from human proteins. Therefore, these algorithms struggle with data from environmental samples, limiting our ability to analyze metaproteomics data. To address this challenge, we trained a new algorithm with data from dozens of diverse environmental bacteria and achieved significant improvements in accuracy across a broad range of organisms. This generality opens proteomics to the world of natural isolates and microbiomes.",10.1101/428334,virology-deep-learning.xlsx,"Uncovering hidden members and functions of the soil microbiome using de novo metaproteomics Metaproteomics has been increasingly utilized for high-throughput molecular characterization in complex environments and has been demonstrated to provide insights into microbial composition and functional roles in soil systems. Despite its potential for the study of microbiomes, significant challenges remain in data analysis, including the creation of a sample-specific protein sequence database as the taxonomic composition of soil is often unknown. Almost all metaproteome analysis tools require this database and their accuracy and sensitivity suffer when the database is incomplete or contains extraneous sequences from organisms which are not present. Here, we leverage a de novo peptide sequencing approach to identify sample composition directly from metaproteomic data. First, we created a deep learning model, Kaiko, to predict the peptide sequences from mass spectrometry data, and trained it on 5 million peptide-spectrum matches from 55 phylogenetically diverse bacteria. After training, Kaiko successfully identified unsequenced soil isolates directly from proteomics data. Finally, we created a pipeline for metaproteome database generation using Kaiko. We tested the pipeline on native soils collected in Kansas, showing that the de novo sequencing model can be employed to construct the sample-specific protein database instead of relying on (un)matched metagenomes.

Emulation can provide a more computationally-efficient output of the individual-based model, by approximating it using a statistical model.

When human samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many assembled contigs as \""unknown\"" since many of the sequences are not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using 300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples.

We propose a deep learning based method named Operon Hunter that uses visual representations of genomic fragments to make operon predictions. Using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques facilitates leveraging the powerful neural networks trained on image datasets by re-training them on a more limited dataset of extensively validated operons. Our method outperforms the previously reported state-of-the-art tools, especially when it comes to predicting full operons and their boundaries accurately. Furthermore, our approach makes it possible to visually identify the features influencing the networks decisions to be subsequently cross-checked by human experts.",0

In August 2019, a population of pearl gentian grouper fry imported to Thailand experienced mass mortality. The diseased fish exhibited darkening, floating on the water surface,  sleepy behaviour, and erratic swimming. We received a set of samples for disease diagnosis. PCR analysis revealed that these samples were positive for NNV but negative for Megalocytivirus ISKNV and Ranavirus. Sequencing the viruss genome and phylogenetic analysis revealed that it is a member of the red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) genotype. In situ hybridization using an NNV-specific probe revealed localization of the virus in the vacuolation lesions of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the retina of infected fish. The virus was successfully isolated from tissue homogenate from diseased fish using the E-11 cell line. This study identified NNV (RGNNV genotype) as a virus associated with massive die-offs in imported pearl grouper fry in Thailand. Considering the infectious nature of the virus and its broad host range, appropriate biosecurity measures are needed to prevent any loss to the marine aquaculture industry.

However, little effort has been directed towards analyzing the properties of the datasets used to train language models. Additionally, only the performance of cherry-picked downstream tasks are used to assess the capacity of LMs.

ResultsWe analyze the entire UniProt database and investigate the different properties that can bias or hinder the performance of LMs such as homology, domain of origin, quality of the data, and completeness of the sequence. We evaluate n-gram and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) LMs to assess the impact of these properties on performance. To our knowledge, this is the first protein dataset with an emphasis on language modelling. Our inclusion of properties specific to proteins gives a detailed analysis of how well natural language processing methods work on biological sequences. We find that organism domain and quality of data have an impact on the performance, while the completeness of the proteins has little influence. The RNN based LM can learn to model Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archaea; but struggles with Viruses. By using the LM we can also generate novel proteins that are shown to be similar to real proteins.

In the biological domain, techniques such as next generation sequencing produce new data at exponential rate, making mere manual curation of knowledge resources simply unfeasible. The major technology to automate knowledge base construction is Information Extraction -- specifically tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Relation Extraction. The major hurdle for IE methods is the availability of labelled data for training, which can be prohibitively expensive and challenging to obtain due to the need of domain experts. Active learning aims at minimizing the cost of manual labelling by only requiring it for smaller and more useful portions of the data. With this motivation, we devised a method to quickly construct highly curated datasets to enable biomedical knowledge base construction. The method, named BioAct, is based on a partnership between automatic annotation methods (leveraging SciBERT with other machine learning models) and subject matter experts and uses active learning to create training datasets in the biological domain.

In recent years, automated methods for knowledge base construction have flourished and have enabled large scale construction and curation of such resources. In the biological domain, techniques such as next generation sequencing produce new data at exponential rate, making mere manual curation of knowledge resources simply unfeasible. The major technology to automate knowledge base construction is Information Extraction -- specifically tasks such as Named Entity Recognition or Relation Extraction. The major hurdle for IE methods is the availability of labelled data for training, which can be prohibitively expensive and challenging to obtain due to the need of domain experts. Active learning aims at minimizing the cost of manual labelling by only requiring it for smaller and more useful portions of the data. With this motivation, we devised a method to quickly construct highly curated datasets to enable biomedical knowledge base construction. The method, named BioAct, is based on a partnership between automatic annotation methods (leveraging SciBERT with other machine learning models) and subject matter experts and uses active learning to create training datasets in the biological domain. The main contribution of this work is twofold; in addition to the BioAct method itself, we publicly release an annotated dataset on antimicrobial resistance, produced by a team of subject matter experts using BioAct.

Our workflow scales to 4096 NPUs with 96.5% scalability and 493.9x speedup in mixed precision computing, while achieving a peak performance of 366.8 PFLOPS (reaching 34.9% theoretical peak) on Pengcheng Cloudbrain-II. Our method paves the way for simulating coronavirus evolution in order to prepare for a future pandemic that will inevitably take place. Our models are released at https://github.com/ZhiweiNiepku/SARS-CoV-2_mutation_simulation to facilitate future related work.

JustificationWe develop a novel multi-constraint variation prediction framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, reaching a peak performance of 366.8 PFLOPS with 96.5% scalability and achieving 493.9x speedup. Our method facilitates the prediction and prioritization of future high-risk variants for the early deployment of drugs and vaccines.

PLMs are often applied in a zero-shot setting, where the effect of each mutation is predicted based on the output of the language model with no additional training.

We explored different protein language models to automatically encode these protein sequences into dense embeddings without the need for additional alignment or structural information. We show that the use of embeddings of receptor-binding proteins presents improvements over handcrafted genomic and protein sequence features.

S.; Chen, D.",Bioinformatics,2023-12-19 00:00:00 UTC,"One of the challenges in a viral pandemic is the emergence of novel variants with different phenotypical characteristics. An ability to forecast future viral individuals at the sequence level enables advance preparation by characterizing the sequences and closing vulnerabilities in current preventative and therapeutic methods. In this article, we explore, in the context of a viral pandemic, the problem of generating complete instances of undiscovered viral protein sequences, which have a high likelihood of being discovered in the future using protein language models. Current approaches to training these models fit model parameters to a known sequence set, which does not suit pandemic forecasting as future sequences differ from known sequences in some respects. To address this, we develop a novel method, called PandoGen, to train protein language models towards the pandemic protein forecasting task. PandoGen combines techniques such as synthetic data generation, conditional sequence generation, and reward-based learning, enabling the model to forecast future sequences, with a high propensity to spread. Applying our method to modeling the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence, we find empirically that our model forecasts twice as many novel sequences with five times the case counts compared to a model that is thirty times larger. Our method forecasts unseen lineages months in advance, whereas models 4x and 30x larger forecast almost no new lineages. When trained on data available up to a month before the onset of important Variants of Concern, our method consistently forecasts sequences belonging to those variants within tight sequence budgets.

Materials and MethodsData were extracted from an enterprise-wide data warehouse for all patients who tested positive for influenza and were seen in ambulatory care between 2009 and 2019 (N = 7,278). A text processing pipeline was used to analyze chart notes for UMLS terms for symptoms of interest to improve data quality completeness.

ResultsThree models identified 7, 8, and 10 predictors, and the most complex model performed best. The addition of the UMLS-driven NLP symptoms data improved data quality (false negatives) and increased the number of significant predictors.

Surprisingly, little is known about the ecological niches occupied by C. neoformans in nature. To expand our understanding of the distribution and ecological associations of this pathogen we implement a Natural Language Processing approach to better describe the niche of C. neoformans. We use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to de novo topic model sets of metagenetic research articles written about varied subjects which either explicitly mention, inadvertently find, or fail to find C. neoformans. These articles are all linked to NCBI Sequence Read Archive datasets of 18S ribosomal RNA and/or Internal Transcribed Spacer gene-regions. The number of topics was determined based on the model coherence score, and articles were assigned to the created topics via a Machine Learning approach with a Random Forest algorithm. Our analysis provides support for a previously suggested linkage between C. neoformans and soils associated with decomposing wood. Our approach, using a search of single-locus metagenetic data, gathering papers connected to the datasets, de novo determination of topics, the number of topics, and assignment of articles to the topics, illustrates how such an analysis pipeline can harness large-scale datasets that are published/available but not necessarily fully analyzed, or whose metadata is not harmonized with other studies. Our approach can be applied to a variety of systems to assert potential evidence of environmental associations.

Author SummaryOur finding that C. neoformans is associated with decomposing wood is reinforced by the general literature on C. neoformans and its close congeneric relatives and warrants further investigation. This work demonstrates the potential utility of pairing Natural Language Processing (NLP) with single-locus metagenetic data for the study of Neglected Tropical Diseases. We present a novel method to study the ecological niches of rare pathogens that leverages the immense amount of data available to researchers in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)combined with a text-mining analysis based on Natural Language Processing. We demonstrate that text processing, noun identification, and verb identification can play an important role in analyzing a large corpus of documents together with metagenetic data. Forging this connection requires access to all of the available ecological 18S ribosomal RNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer NCBI SRA datasets. These datasets use metabarcoding to query taxonomic diversity in eukaryotic organisms, and in the case of the Internal Transcribed Spacer, they specifically target Fungi. The presence of specific species is inferred when diagnostic 18S or ITS gene region sequences are found in the SRA data. We searched for C. neoformans in all 18S and ITS datasets available and gathered all associated journal articles that either cite the SRA data accessions or are cited in the SRA data accessions.

Published metagenetic data often have associated metadata including: latitude and longitude, temperature, and other physical characteristics describing the conditions in which the metagenetic sample was collected. These metadata are not always be presented in consistent formats, so harmonizing study methods may be needed to appropriately compare metagenetic data as commonly required in metanalysis studies. We present an analysis which takes as input articles associated with SRA datasets that were found to contain evidence of C. neoformans. We apply NLP methods to this corpus of articles to describe the niche of C. neoformans. Our results reinforce the current understanding of C. neoformanss niche, indicating the pertinence of employing a NLP analysis to identify the niche of an organism. This approach could further the description of virtually any other organism that routinely appears in metagenetic surveys, especially pathogens, whose ecological niches are unknown or poorly understood.

Despite diverse pathogens (virus, bacteria, or fungi) being detected in AD subjects brains, most research has focused on individual pathogens and only a few studies investigated the hypothesis of a bacterial brain microbiome. We profiled the bacterial communities present in non-demented controls and AD subjects brains.

ResultsWe obtained post-mortem samples from the brains of 32 individual subjects, comprising 16 AD and 16 control aged-matched subjects with a total of 130 samples from the frontal and temporal lobes and entorhinal cortex. We used full-length 16S rRNA gene amplification with Pacific Biosciences sequencing technology to identify the bacteria.

We detected bacteria in the brains of both cohorts with the principal bacteria comprising Propionibacterium acnes (recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes) and two species each of Acinetobacter and Comamonas genera. We used a hierarchical Bayesian method to detect differences in relative abundance among AD and control groups. Because of large abundance variances we also employed an unconventional analysis approach that utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation, often used in computational linguistics. This allowed us to identify 5 classes of samples, each revealing a different microbiome. Assuming that samples represented infections that potentially began at different times, we ordered these classes in time, finding that the last class exclusively explained the existence or non-existence of AD.

ConclusionsThe AD-related pathogenicity of the brain microbiome seems to be based on a complex polymicrobial dynamic. The time ordering revealed a rise and fall of the abundance of Propionibacterium acnes with pathogenicity occurring for an off-peak abundance level in association with at least one other bacterium from a set of genera that included: Methylobacterium, Bacillus, Caulobacter, Delftia, and Variovorax. P. acnes may also be involved with outcompeting the Comamonas species, which were strongly associated with non-demented brain microbiome, whose early destruction could be the first stage of the disease.

It remains unclear about the signals guiding the specific secretion of the effectors. Here, we adopted an in silico approach to analyze the mRNA sequences encoding the putative peptides essential for effective secretion and translocation of type III and IV effectors. A surprisingly high proportion of type III effectors showed tolerance on frameshift mutations in signal-encoding mRNA sequences, and in contrast, very low percentage of type IV effectors showed the similar frameshift tolerance. The type III effectors with frameshift tolerance of secretion signals were widely distributed in effector or signal families and bacterial species. Natural frameshifts could be identified in type III effector genes, which were often remedied in time by nearby paired insertions or deletions. Frameshift-derived peptide sequences also retained the common properties present in the signal peptides of raw type III effectors. Natural language processing models were adopted to represent the common features in the mRNA sequences encoding N-terminal peptides of type III effectors or C-terminal peptides of type IV effectors, with which transfer learning models could well predict the effectors, especially type IV effectors. The observations in the study would facilitate us understand the nature and evolution of secretion signals of type III and IV effectors.

SignificanceIt has been a debate on the nature of signals for translocation of type III secreted effectors for a long time. Meanwhile, there has been no examination on the possibility of mRNA being as translocation signals for type IV or other types of secreted effectors. By computational simulation, the study demonstrated the protein nature of translocation signals for both type IV effectors and most type III effectors. Despite wide frameshift tolerance and atypical common features in mRNA sequences encoding the putative N-terminal signal sequences of type III effectors, more typical common physicochemical and amino acid composition properties between the mutation-derived and raw peptides, and the frequent self-correction phenomenon for naturally happening frameshifts supported the translocation signals at protein level of type III effectors.

Natural language processing models were adopted to represent the common features in the mRNA sequences encoding N-terminal peptides of type III effectors or C-terminal peptides of type IV effectors, with which transfer learning models could well predict the effectors, especially type IV effectors. The observations in the study would facilitate us understand the nature and evolution of secretion signals of type III and IV effectors.

SignificanceIt has been a debate on the nature of signals for translocation of type III secreted effectors for a long time. Meanwhile, there has been no examination on the possibility of mRNA being as translocation signals for type IV or other types of secreted effectors. By computational simulation, the study demonstrated the protein nature of translocation signals for both type IV effectors and most type III effectors. Despite wide frameshift tolerance and atypical common features in mRNA sequences encoding the putative N-terminal signal sequences of type III effectors, more typical common physicochemical and amino acid composition properties between the mutation-derived and raw peptides, and the frequent self-correction phenomenon for naturally happening frameshifts supported the translocation signals at protein level of type III effectors. The common features in mRNA sequences encoding the translocation signal peptides of type III and IV effectors could also be combined in models for better prediction of the effectors respectively.",0

P.; Cai, W.; Zill, N. A.; Zhang, W.; Ojha, A. K.",Microbiology,2019-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) spontaneously grows at the air-medium interface forming pellicle biofilms, which harbor more drug tolerant persisters than planktonic cultures. The underlying basis for increased persisters in Mtb biofilms is unknown. Using a Tn-seq approach, we show here that multiple genes that are necessary for fitness of Mtb cells within biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures, are also important for their tolerance to a diverse set of stressors and antibiotics. Thus, development of Mtb biofilms appears to be associated with population enrichment, in which endogenous stresses presumably generated by challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain tolerance to exogenous stresses including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of biofilms determines the frequency of persisters: morphologically indistinguishable monoculture biofilms of a {Delta}pstC2A1 mutant hypersensitive to rifampicin harbor [~]20-fold fewer persisters than wild-type. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development significantly contributes to the persister frequency. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLP).

The underlying basis for increased persisters in Mtb biofilms is unknown. Using a Tn-seq approach, we show here that multiple genes that are necessary for fitness of Mtb cells within biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures, are also important for their tolerance to a diverse set of stressors and antibiotics. Thus, development of Mtb biofilms appears to be associated with population enrichment, in which endogenous stresses presumably generated by challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain tolerance to exogenous stresses including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of biofilms determines the frequency of persisters: morphologically indistinguishable monoculture biofilms of a {Delta}pstC2A1 mutant hypersensitive to rifampicin harbor [~]20-fold fewer persisters than wild-type. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development significantly contributes to the persister frequency. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLP).

Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to very few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes.

Methods and resultsIn this study, we train artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA).

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells.

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells.

ResultsIntegrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity ({inverted question}0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features.

We developed an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP), predicting MAP presentation solely from mRNA sequences flanking the MAP-coding codons (MCCs), while excluding the MCC per se.

C.; Wang, S.; Wang, X.",Bioinformatics,2020-08-24 00:00:00 UTC,"The accuracy of variant calling is crucially important in clinical settings, as the misdiagnosis of a genetic disease such as cancer can compromise patient survival. Although many variant callers were developed, variant-calling accuracy is still insufficient for clinical applications.

Here we describe UVC, a method for calling small variants of germline or somatic origin. By combining contrary assumptions with sublation, we found two principles to improve variant calling. First, we discovered the following power-law universality: allele fraction is inversely proportional to the cubic root of variant-calling error rate. Second, we found that zero inflation can combine Bayesian and frequentist models of sequencing bias.

We evaluated UVC with other state-of-the-art variant callers by considering a variety of calling modes (germline, somatic, tumor-only, and cell-free DNA with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)), sequencing platforms (Illumina, BGI, and IonTorrent), sequencing types (whole-genome, whole-exome, and PCR-amplicon), human reference genomes (hg19, hs37d5, and GRCh38), aligners (BWA and NovoAlign), and representative sequencing depths and purities for both tumor and normal. UVC generally outperformed other germline variant callers on the GIAB germline truth sets. UVC strongly outperformed other somatic variant callers on 192 scenarios of in silico mixtures simulating 192 combinations of tumor/normal sequencing depths and tumor/normal purities. UVC strongly outperformed other somatic variant callers on the GIAB somatic truth sets derived from physical mixture and on the SEQC2 somatic reference sets derived from the breast-cancer cell-line HCC1395. UVC achieved 100% concordance with the manual review conducted by multiple independent researchers on a Qiagen 71-gene-panel dataset derived from 16 patients with colon adenoma. Additionally, UVC outperformed Mageri and smCounter2, the state-of-the-art UMI-aware variant callers, on the tumor-only datasets used for publishing these two variant callers. Performance is measured by using sensitivity-specificity trade off for all called variants. The improved variant calls generated by UVC from previously published UMI-based sequencing data are able to provide additional biological insight about DNA damage repair.

We collected written descriptions of 7,021 species of bacteria and archaea from Bergeys Manual. We read the descriptions and manually identified (labeled) which species were fermentative or produced acetate. We then trained neural networks to predict these labels.

In samples processed at 75 {degrees}C, the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Psychrotrophs were not detectable up to 15 days of storage and lactic acid bacteria were not detectable even at the end of the storage period. The optimal ANN topology for modeling Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Psychrotroph contained 9 neurons in the hidden layer, but for TVC and LAB, it was 14 neurons.",0

Rabies, one of the deadliest known zoonotic diseases, is still causing 60.000 human deaths annually. Upon central nervous system (CNS) entry, neurotropic rabies virus (RABV) preserves the neural network by limiting apoptosis and inflammation. To date, we do not fully understand the factors determining RABV tropism and why glial cells are unable to clear RABV from the infected brain. Here, we compare susceptibilities and innate immune responses of CNS cell types towards infection with virulent dog RABV Tha and less virulent Th2P-4M in vitro, highlighting differences in cellular susceptibility and antiviral responses. Less virulent Th2P-4M bears mutations introduced in viral phosphoprotein (P-protein) and matrix protein (M-protein) thereby hindering viral immune evasion of the host nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{kappa}B) and Janus kinase (JAK) - signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (STAT) pathways. Our results reveal that human neural stem cell (hNSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes, in contrast to human iPSC-derived microglia, are highly susceptible to Tha and Th2P-4M infection in vitro. Surprisingly, Th2P-4M presents a stronger neurotropism in hNSC-derived CNS cultures compared to Tha suggesting that NF-{kappa}B- and JAK-STAT-mediated antiviral host responses are defining RABV replication and thereby its tropism. Further, we show that astrocyte-like (SVGp12) and microglia-like (HMC3) cells protect neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) from Tha infection in vitro. Transcription profiles and quantification of intracellular protein levels revealed major differences in antiviral immune responses mediated by neurons, astrocytes (IFNB1, CCL5, CXCL10, IL1B, IL6, LIF), and microglia (CCL5, CXCL10, ISG15, MX1, IL6) upon virulent Tha infection.

Author summaryRabies virus (RABV) neurotropism is widely reported as a unique feature of rabies, and still the exact mechanism underlying RABV susceptibility remains to be elucidated. Several receptors are known to accelerate RABV entry to the cell (1-4) and yet, none of them seems to be essential for successful infection (5,6) questioning a marked cellular tropism.

Here, I reveal novel molecular mechanisms of these proteases via sequence and predicted structure alignment and propose novel cellular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of viral arthritis by predicting which human proteins are likely cleaved by these proteases. In addition to the known primary cysteine mechanism in all alphaviruses and a secondary serine mechanism documented in chikungunya virus (CHIKV), I discovered secondary cysteine and threonine mechanisms exist in many other alphaviruses and that these secondary mechanisms coevolve with their viral polyprotein cleavages. As for cleavage prediction, neural networks trained on 93 different putative viral polyprotein cleavages achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.965, and, when applied to the human proteome, predicted that hundreds of proteins may be vulnerable. Notable pathways likely affected by cleavages include the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, antiproteases, protein translation/folding/glycosylation/ubiquitination, cellular differentiation, inflammation, and vesicle trafficking, hinting that this viral protease is a more important virulence factor than previously believed.",0

Here, we combined analyses of diverse sequences and structures of coronavirus spikes with data from deep mutational scanning to design SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens containing the most significant mutations that may emerge. We trained a neural network to predict RBD expression and ACE2 binding from sequence, which allowed us to determine that these antigens are stable and bind to ACE2. Thus, they represent viable variants. We then used a computational model of affinity maturation (AM) to study the antibody response to immunization with different combinations of the designed antigens. The results suggest that immunization with a cocktail of the antigens is likely to promote evolution of higher titers of antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 variants than immunization or infection with the wildtype virus alone.

J.; Arrizabalaga, G.",Microbiology,2022-01-25 00:00:00 UTC,"The pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii is mainly due to tissue damage caused by the repeating lytic cycles of the parasite. Many proteins localized to the pellicle of the parasite, particularly kinases, have been identified as critical regulators of the Toxoplasma lytic cycle. However, little is known about the associated protein phosphatases. Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL), a highly conserved tyrosine phosphatase, is an oncogene that plays pivotal roles in mammalian cells and typically associates with membranes via a conserved prenylation site. PRL in Toxoplasma has a predicted prenylation motif in the C-terminus like other homologs. We have determined that TgPRL localizes to the plasma membrane and that disruption of TgPRL results in a defect in the parasites ability to attach to host cells. This function is dependent both on TgPRLs membrane localization and phosphatase activity. Importantly, in vivo experiments have shown that while mice infected with parental strain parasites die within days of infection, those infected with parasites lacking TgPRL not only survive but also develop immunity that confers protection against subsequent infection with wild-type parasites. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the PRL-CNNM (Cyclin M) complex, which regulates intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells, is also present in Toxoplasma. Consistent with this interaction, parasites lacking TgPRL had higher intracellular Mg2+ levels than the parental or complemented strains, suggesting TgPRL is involved in regulating intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis.

Deep learning methods have been used to model protein sequences for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A few significant drawbacks in these studies include being deficient in modelling end-to-end protein sequences, modelling only those genomic positions that show high activity and upsampling the number of sequences at each genomic position for balancing the frequency of mutations. To mitigate such drawbacks, the current approach uses a generative model, an encoder-decoder neural network, to learn the natural progression of spike protein sequences through adjacent clades of the phylogenetic tree of Nextstrain clades. Encoder transforms a set of spike protein sequences from the source clade (20A) into its latent representation. Decoder uses the latent representation, along with Gaussian distributed noise, to generate a different set of protein sequences that are closer to the target clade (20B). The source and target clades are adjacent nodes in the phylogenetic tree of different evolving clades of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sequences of amino acids are generated, for the entire length, at each genomic position using the latent representation of the amino acid generated at a previous step. Using trained models, protein sequences from the source clade are used to generate sequences that form a collection of evolved sequences belonging to all children clades of the source clade. A comparison of this predicted evolution (between source and generated sequences) of proteins with the true evolution (between source and target sequences) shows a high pearson correlation (> 0.7). Moreover, the distribution of the frequencies of substitutions per genomic position, including high- and low-frequency positions, in source-target sequences and source-generated sequences exhibit a high resemblance (pearson correlation > 0.7). In addition, the model partially predicts a few substitutions at specific genomic positions for the sequences of unseen clades (20J (Gamma)) where they show little activity during training. These outcomes show the potential of this approach in learning the latent mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences.

A challenging task is the development of fast and accurate tools that are able to distinguish between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants and assign them to a clade.

ResultsIn this paper, we leverage the Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an original method that learns how to classify genome sequences that we implement into CouGaR-g, a tool for the clade assignment problem on SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

ConclusionsBy combining FCGR and CNNs, we develop a method that achieves a better accuracy than Covidex (which is based on Random Forest) for clade assignment of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, also thanks to our training on a much larger dataset, with comparable running times. Our method implemented in CouGaR-g is able to detect k-mers that capture relevant biological information that distinguishes the clades, known as marker variants.

AvailabilityThe trained models can be tested online providing a FASTA file (with one or multiple sequences) at https://huggingface.co/spaces/BIASLab/sars-cov-2-classification-fcgr. CouGaR-g is also available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/CouGaR-g under the GPL.",1

This makes the array analysis much more robust to noise and provides a means of condensing the disease differentiating information from the array into a compact form that can be readily used for disease classification or population health monitoring.",0

The effective allocation of resources is often difficult due to external and internal factors imposing nonlinear fluctuations in the prevalence of dengue fever. We aimed to construct an early-warning system that could accurately forecast subsequent dengue cases in three dengue endemic regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and the Philippines. The problem is solely regarded as a time series forecasting problem ignoring the known epidemiology of dengue fever as well as the other meteorological variables.

Since machine learning methods have proved to be efficient for the classification of biological data we investigated how artificial neural networks perform on the task of phage taxonomy.

ResultsIn this work, 5,920 constructed and refined profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), derived from 8,721 phage sequences classified into 12 well known phage families, were used to scan phage proteome datasets.

Most T cell epitope prediction tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data. The ability of currently available tools to predict T cell epitopes has not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we used a recently published dataset that systematically defined T cell epitopes recognized in vaccinia virus (VACV) infected mice, considering both peptides predicted to bind MHC or experimentally eluted from infected cells, making this the most comprehensive dataset of T cell epitopes mapped in a complex pathogen. We evaluated the performance of all currently publicly available computational T cell epitope prediction tools to identify these major epitopes from all peptides encoded in the VACV proteome. We found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). Impressively, these methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top 0.04% (N = 277) of peptides in the VACV proteome (N = 767,788).

We found that all methods were able to improve epitope identification above random, with the best performance achieved by neural network-based predictions trained on both MHC binding and MHC ligand elution data (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). Impressively, these methods were able to capture more than half of the major epitopes in the top 0.04% (N = 277) of peptides in the VACV proteome (N = 767,788). These performance metrics provide guidance for immunologists as to which prediction methods to use. In addition, this benchmark was implemented in an open and easy to reproduce format, providing developers with a framework for future comparisons against new tools.\n\nAuthor summaryComputational prediction tools are used to screen peptides to identify potential T cell epitope candidates. These tools, developed using machine learning methods, save time and resources in many immunological studies including vaccine discovery and cancer neoantigen identification. In addition to the already existing methods several epitope prediction tools are being developed these days but they lack a comprehensive and uniform evaluation to see which method performs best. In this study we did a comprehensive evaluation of publicly accessible MHC I restricted T cell epitope prediction tools using a recently published dataset of Vaccinia virus epitopes. We found that methods based on artificial neural network architecture and trained on both MHC binding and ligand elution data showed very high performance (NetMHCPan-4.0 and MHCFlurry). This benchmark analysis will help immunologists to choose the right prediction method for their desired work and will also serve as a framework for tool developers to evaluate new prediction methods.",0

The inability to test new therapeutic applications was highlighted by the generally unsatisfactory results from drug repurposing efforts in COVID-19.

HypothesisAddressing this challenge requires the application of simulation-based, model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in a fashion akin to training the game-playing AIs. We have previously demonstrated the potential of this method in the context of bacterial sepsis in which the microbial infection is responsive to antibiotic therapy. The current work addresses the control problem of multi-modal, adaptive immunomodulation in the circumstance where there is no effective anti-pathogen therapy (e.g., in a novel viral pandemic or in the face of resistant microbes).

MethodsThis is a proof-of-concept study that determines the controllability of sepsis without the ability to pharmacologically suppress the pathogen. We use as a surrogate system a previously validated agent-based model, the Innate Immune Response Agent-based Model (IIRABM), for control discovery using DRL. The DRL algorithm  trains an AI on simulations of infection where both the control and observation spaces are limited to operating upon the defined immune mediators included in the IIRABM (a total of 11). Policies were learned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient approach, with the objective function being a return to baseline system health.

ResultsDRL trained an AI policy that improved system mortality from 85% to 10.4%.

DiscussionThe current treatment of sepsis is hampered by limitations in therapeutic options able to affect the biology of sepsis. This is heightened in circumstances where no effective antimicrobials exist, as was the case for COVID-19. Current AI methods are intrinsically unable to address this problem; doing so requires training AIs in contexts that fully represent the counterfactual space of potential treatments.

These findings have strong implications for understanding the pathophysiology and evolution of TB disease and suggest that aerosolized drug delivery strategies for TB should be reconsidered.",1

Collectively these findings reveal marked differences between Australian and overseas-derived (non-Australian) IVIGs in immunoglobulin composition and biochemical characteristics, and presence of additional carry-over proteins from plasma. These findings prompt the need for further evaluation of the micro-compositions of individual formulations. Perhaps detailed mining and improved comparative understanding of each IVIG formulation, may enable highly tailored and strategic clinical use of certain formulations that are personalised best-fit treatments for particular conditions. Such as in treatment of a neuropathy, as compared to another formulation, more suited for treating a particular infectious disease. The most salient and overarching study conclusion is need for caution in attributing equivalence across IVIGs.",0

Microarray analysis was carried out using CHIKV strain (Prototype and Indian) infected Vero cells and two host isozymes, MK2 and MK3 were selected for further analysis. Gene silencing and drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3 in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation (a) inhibitor (CMPD1) treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role of MAPKAPKs during the late phase of CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness of this drug against CHIKV.

Some Bt Cry proteins, e.g., Cry5B, target nematodes (roundworms) and show exceptional promise as anthelmintics (cures for parasitic nematode diseases). We have recently described IBaCC (for Inactivated Bacteria with Cytosolic Crystal(s)) in which bioactive Bt Cry crystals (containing Cry5B) are fully contained within the cytosol of dead bacterial ghosts. Here we demonstrate that these IBaCC-trapped Cry5B crystals can be liberated and purified away from cellular constituents yielding Purified Cytosolic Crystals (PCC).

Cry5B PCC is also highly active in vivo against experimental human hookworm and Ascaris infections in rodents.

Some Bt Cry proteins, e.g., Cry5B, target nematodes (roundworms) and show exceptional promise as anthelmintics (cures for parasitic nematode diseases). We have recently described IBaCC (for Inactivated Bacteria with Cytosolic Crystal(s)) in which bioactive Bt Cry crystals (containing Cry5B) are fully contained within the cytosol of dead bacterial ghosts. Here we demonstrate that these IBaCC-trapped Cry5B crystals can be liberated and purified away from cellular constituents yielding Purified Cytosolic Crystals (PCC). Cry5B PCC contains [~]95% Cry5B protein out of the total protein content. Cry5B PCC is highly bioactive against parasitic nematode larvae and adults in vitro. Cry5B PCC is also highly active in vivo against experimental human hookworm and Ascaris infections in rodents. The process was scaled up to the 100 liter scale to produce PCC for a pilot study to treat two foals infected with the Ascarid, Parascaris spp. Single dose Cry5B PCC brought the fecal egg counts of both foals to zero. These studies describe the process for the scalable production of purified Bt crystals and define a new active pharmaceutical ingredient form of Bt Cry proteins.

NON-TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE PARAGRAPHBacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins are widely and safely used as insecticides. Recent studies show they also can cure gastrointestinal parasitic worm (nematode) infections when ingested. However, reproducible, scalable, and practical techniques for purifying these proteins have been lacking. Here, we address this severe limitation and present scalable and practical methods for large-scale purification of potently bioactive B. thuringiensis crystals and crystal proteins. The resultant product, called Purified Cytosolic Crystals (PCC), is highly compatible with ingestible drug delivery and formulation. Furthermore, there are growing applications in agriculture and insect control where access to large quantities of purified crystal proteins are desirable and where these methods will find great utility.",0

V705I and N709H are novel mutations that map to the portion of domain V that enters domain I in the postfusion structure. S383F, G645R, and T509M are novel mutations that map to an intersection of three domains in a prefusion model of gB. We introduced these second-site mutations individually and in combination into wild-type gB and gB3A to examine the impact of the mutations on fusion and expression. V705I and A855V (a known hyperfusogenic mutation) restored the fusion function of gB3A, whereas S383F and G645R dampened fusion and T509M and N709H worked in concert to restore gB3A fusion. The results identify two regions in the gB ectodomain that modulate the fusion activity of gB, potentially by impacting intramolecular interactions and stability of the prefusion and/or postfusion gB trimer.\n\nIMPORTANCEGlycoprotein B (gB) is an essential viral protein that is conserved in all herpesviruses and is required for virus entry. gB is thought to undergo a conformational change that provides the energy to fuse the viral and cellular membranes, however the details of this conformational change and the structure of the prefusion and intermediate conformations of gB are not known. Previously, we demonstrated that mutations in the gB \""arm\"" region inhibit fusion and impart a small plaque phenotype. Using serial passage of a virus carrying these mutations, we identified revertants with restored plaque size. The revertant viruses acquired novel mutations in gB that restored fusion function and mapped to two sites in the gB ectodomain. This work supports our hypothesis that an interaction between the gB arm and the core of gB is critical for gB refolding and provides details about the function of gB in herpesvirus mediated fusion and subsequent virus entry.",10.1101/412221,virology-vision-transformer.xlsx,"Natural selection of glycoprotein B (gB) mutations that rescue the small plaque phenotype of a fusion-impaired herpes simplex virus (HSV) mutant Glycoprotein B (gB) is a conserved viral fusion protein that is required for herpesvirus entry. To mediate fusion with the cellular membrane, gB refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion conformation. We hypothesize that an interaction between the C-terminal arm and the central coiled-coil of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) gB ectodomain is critical for fusion. We previously reported that three mutations in the C-terminal arm (I671A/H681A/F683A, called gB3A) greatly reduced cell-cell fusion and that virus carrying these mutations had a small plaque phenotype and delayed entry into cells.

To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models modified to incorporate epidemiological and geographic information.

Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions.

Here, we developed the ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model of infection using porcine lungs to investigate Klebsiella pneumoniae-triggered pneumonia as model of respiratory infections. The porcine EVLP model recapitulates features of K. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia lung injury. This model is also useful to assess the pathogenic potential of K. pneumoniae as we observed that the attenuated Klebsiella capsule mutant strain caused less pathological tissue damage with a concomitant decrease in the bacterial burden compare to lungs infected with the wild type. The porcine EVLP model allows assessment of inflammatory responses following infection; similar to the mouse pneumonia model, we observed an increase of il-10 in the lungs infected with the wild type and an increase of ifn-{gamma} in lungs infected with the capsule mutant. This model also allows monitoring phenotypes at the single-cell level. Wild-type K. pneumoniae skews macrophages towards an M2-like state. In vitro experiments probing pig bone marrow-derived macrophages uncovered the role of the M2 transcriptional factor STAT6, and that Klebsiella-induced il10 expression is controlled by p38 and ERK.
