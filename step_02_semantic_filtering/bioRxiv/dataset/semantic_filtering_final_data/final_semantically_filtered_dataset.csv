Although the increasing host range mechanism of the virus is largely unknown; persistent genetic mutations have been blamed as a key factor in the re-organization of the host response and the host range. To uncover the underlying core bases of the two important antigenic proteins of influenza virus (HA and NA), functional data mining and image processing analysis of over 8000 protein sequences of different HA and NA subtypes were performed. Each amino acid sequence in HA or NA proteins sat as a feature or variable and two polynomial datasets were created and subjected into conventional prediction models. The average accuracies of these predictive models for HA subtype classifications ranged from 38.9% for SVM to 87.2% for Decision Tree models. NA subtype classification with conventional prediction models varied from 81.3% to 99.87% for SVM and KNN models, respectively. Then amino acid sequence datasets were converted to binary images; subtypes feature sat as target variable, and target label determined by image processing convolution neural network.

Rapid identification of virus-host interactions can reveal mechanistic insights into infectious diseases and shed light on potential treatments. Current computational prediction methods for novel viruses are based mainly on protein sequences. However, it is not clear to what extent other important features, such as the symptoms caused by the viruses, could contribute to a predictor. Disease phenotypes (i.e., signs and symptoms) are readily accessible from clinical diagnosis and we hypothesize that they may act as a potential proxy and an additional source of information for the underlying molecular interactions between the pathogens and hosts.

ResultsWe developed DeepViral, a deep learning based method that predicts protein-protein interactions (PPI) between humans and viruses. Motivated by the potential utility of infectious disease phenotypes, we first embedded human proteins and viruses in a shared space using their associated phenotypes and functions, supported by formalized background knowledge from biomedical ontologies. By jointly learning from protein sequences and phenotype features, DeepViral significantly improves over existing sequence-based methods for intra- and inter-species PPI prediction.

This has led to an increased importance of understanding sequence data related to COVID-19. In this chapter, we propose an alignment-free k-mer based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model that can classify 20 different variants of COVID-19. We handle the class imbalance problem by sampling a fixed number of sequences for each class label. We handle the vanishing gradient problem in LSTMs arising from long sequences by dividing the sequence into fixed lengths and obtaining results on individual runs. Our results show that one-vs-all classifiers have test accuracies as high as 92.5% with tuned hyperparameters compared to the multi-class classifier model.

In this chapter, we propose an alignment-free k-mer based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model that can classify 20 different variants of COVID-19. We handle the class imbalance problem by sampling a fixed number of sequences for each class label. We handle the vanishing gradient problem in LSTMs arising from long sequences by dividing the sequence into fixed lengths and obtaining results on individual runs.

In China, DF expanded from coastal region to inner land, and the incidence sharply increased in the last few years. In this study, we conduct the analysis of dengue using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. This is an artificial intelligence technology, to develop a precise dengue forecast model.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe model is developed from monthly dengue cases and local meteorological data of 2005-2018 among top 20 Chinese cities with a record of the highest dengue incidence. The first 13 year data were used to construct the LSTM and to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018. The results are compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models. Model performance and prediction accuracy were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). With the LSTM method, the prediction measurements of average RMSE drop by 54.79% and 34.76% as compared with the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model and Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Model (ZIGAM). Our results showed that if only local data were used to develop forecast models, the LSTM neural networks would fail to capture the transmission characteristics of dengue virus in areas with fewer dengue cases. Contrarily, transfer learning (TL) can improve the accuracy of prediction of the LSTM neural network model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.\n\nConclusion and significanceThe LSTM model is beneficial in predicting dengue incidence as compared with other previously published forecasting models.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a dataset of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a dataset of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals.

In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases to humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to very few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes.

Methods and resultsIn this study, we train artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9 {+/-} 2.8% (N=927), 68.7 {+/-} 4.8% (N=140), 80.3 {+/-} 2.0% (N=158), and 75.7 {+/-} 2.5% (N=298), respectively.

As for the importance of ENaC in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether SARS-CoV-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with ENaC proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets, and found the PLAU (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), SCNN1G ({gamma}ENaC), and ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells.

Plasmin, and other host proteases, may cleave the furin site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and {gamma} subunits of epithelial sodium channels ({gamma} ENaC), resulting in an increment in virus infectivity and channel activity. As for the importance of ENaC in the regulation of airway surface and alveolar fluid homeostasis, whether SARS-CoV-2 will share and strengthen the cleavage network with ENaC proteins at the single-cell level is urgently worthy of consideration. To address this issue, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) datasets, and found the PLAU (encoding urokinase plasminogen activator), SCNN1G ({gamma}ENaC), and ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) were co-expressed in alveolar epithelial, basal, club, and ciliated epithelial cells.

A few significant drawbacks in these studies include being deficient in modelling end-to-end protein sequences, modelling only those genomic positions that show high activity and upsampling the number of sequences at each genomic position for balancing the frequency of mutations. To mitigate such drawbacks, the current approach uses a generative model, an encoder-decoder neural network, to learn the natural progression of spike protein sequences through adjacent clades of the phylogenetic tree of Nextstrain clades. Encoder transforms a set of spike protein sequences from the source clade (20A) into its latent representation. Decoder uses the latent representation, along with Gaussian distributed noise, to generate a different set of protein sequences that are closer to the target clade (20B). The source and target clades are adjacent nodes in the phylogenetic tree of different evolving clades of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sequences of amino acids are generated, for the entire length, at each genomic position using the latent representation of the amino acid generated at a previous step. Using trained models, protein sequences from the source clade are used to generate sequences that form a collection of evolved sequences belonging to all children clades of the source clade. A comparison of this predicted evolution (between source and generated sequences) of proteins with the true evolution (between source and target sequences) shows a high pearson correlation (> 0.7). Moreover, the distribution of the frequencies of substitutions per genomic position, including high- and low-frequency positions, in source-target sequences and source-generated sequences exhibit a high resemblance (pearson correlation > 0.7). In addition, the model partially predicts a few substitutions at specific genomic positions for the sequences of unseen clades (20J (Gamma)) where they show little activity during training.

Application of 1D-CNN to the word2vec-generated feature matrices reduced computational costs, thus extending the allowable length of protein sequences to 9000 amino acid residues. Cross- attention PHV outperformed existing state-of-the-art models using a benchmark dataset and accurately predicted PPIs for unknown viruses. Cross-attention PHV also predicted human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs with area under the curve values >0.95.",1,1

Despite their lower disease severity, they can reinfect COVID-19 patients and infect vaccinated individuals as well. The high number of mutations in these variants render them resistant to antibodies that otherwise neutralize the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recent research has shown that despite its strong immune evasion, Omicron still induces strong T Cell responses similar to the original variant. This work investigates the molecular basis for this observation using the neural network tools NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCiipan-4.0. The antigens presented through the MHC Class I and Class II pathways from all the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants were compared across numerous high frequency HLAs. All variants were observed to have equivalent T cell antigenicity. A novel positive control system was engineered in the form of spike variants that did evade T Cell responses, unlike Omicron. These evasive spike proteins were used to statistically confirm that the Omicron variants did not exhibit lower antigenicity in the MHC pathways. These results suggest that T Cell immunity mounts a strong defense against COVID-19 which is difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to overcome through mere evolution.

The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate, ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the relative size of the high risk group, and iii) prediction forecast window (one up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future.\n\nResultsThe model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas.

The ability to generate large metagenomic assemblies of mixed microbial and viral sequences provides the opportunity to tease apart complex microbiome dynamics, but these analyses are currently limited by the tools available for analyses of viral genomes and assessing their metabolic impacts on microbiomes.

DesignHere we present VIBRANT, the first method to utilize a hybrid machine learning and protein similarity approach that is not reliant on sequence features for automated recovery and annotation of viruses, determination of genome quality and completeness, and characterization of virome function from metagenomic assemblies. VIBRANT uses neural networks of protein signatures and a novel v-score metric that circumvents traditional boundaries to maximize identification of lytic viral genomes and integrated proviruses, including highly diverse viruses. VIBRANT highlights viral auxiliary metabolic genes and metabolic pathways, thereby serving as a user-friendly platform for evaluating virome function. VIBRANT was trained and validated on reference virus datasets as well as microbiome and virome data.

ResultsVIBRANT showed superior performance in recovering higher quality viruses and concurrently reduced the false identification of non-viral genome fragments in comparison to other virus identification programs, specifically VirSorter and VirFinder. When applied to 120,834 metagenomically derived viral sequences representing several human and natural environments, VIBRANT recovered an average of 94.5% of the viruses, whereas VirFinder and VirSorter achieved less powerful performance, averaging 48.1% and 56.0%, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER and Prophage Hunter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes associated with Crohns Disease to show that specific viral groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link to maintenance of diseased states.
