Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time.

In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemics dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0.

We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.",10.1101/2020.05.05.20091736,virology-agentic-ai.xlsx,"Importance of Interaction Structure and Stochasticity for Epidemic Spreading: A COVID-19 Case Study In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, computer simulations are used to predict the evolution of the virus propagation and to evaluate the prospective effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household ""bubbles"" can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.

Author SummarySocial distancing is the main tool used to control COVID-19, and involves reducing contacts that could potentially transmit infection with strategies like school closures, work-from-home policies, mask-wearing, or lockdowns. These measures have been applied around the world, but in situations where they have suppressed infections, the effect has not been immediate or consistent. In this study we use a mathematical model to simulate the spread and control of COVID-19, tracking the different settings of person-to-person contact (e.g. household, school, workplace) and the different clinical stages an infected individual may pass through before recovery or death. We find that there are often long delays between when strong social distancing policies are adopted and when cases, hospitalizations, and deaths peak and begin to decline. Moreover, we find that the amount of transmission that happens within versus outside the household is critical to determining when social distancing can be effective and the delay until the epidemic peak. We show how the interaction between unmitigated households spread and residual external connections due to essential activities impacts individual risk and population infection levels.

Most research is, however, centered around characterizing the epidemic based on point estimates like the average infectiousness or the average number of contacts.

In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a populations heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels.

Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation.

We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the populations heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.

Author summaryComputational modeling can support decision-making in the face of pandemics like COVID-19. Models help to understand transmission data and predict important epidemiological properties (e.g., When will herd immunity be reached?). They can also examine the effectiveness of certain measures, and--to a limited extent--extrapolate the dynamics under specific assumptions. In all these cases, the heterogeneity of the population plays an important role. For instance, it is known that connectivity differences in (and among) age groups influence the dynamics of epidemic propagation. Here we focus on two types of differences among individuals: their social interactions and on how infectious they are. We show that only considering population averages (e.g., What is the average number of contacts of an individual?) may lead to misleading conclusions, because the individual differences (such as those related to the epidemic (over-)dispersion) play an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics. Many commonly used model classes, such as SEIR-type ODE compartmental models, ignore differences within a population to a large extent.

The tool was originally developed and externally validated in population-based settings and has not yet been validated in a clinical setting.

ObjectiveTo externally validate the PARC tool in children seen in paediatric pulmonology clinics.

MethodsThe Swiss Paediatric Airway Cohort (SPAC) is a prospective study of children seen in respiratory outpatient clinics across Switzerland. This analysis included children seen at ages 1-6 years for cough or wheeze at baseline and who completed the follow-up questionnaire 2 years later. The outcome was defined as current wheeze plus use of asthma medication. In sensitivity analyses, we explored effects of varied inclusion criteria and outcomes. We assessed performance by describing sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value (NPV, PPV), area under the curve (AUC), scaled Briers score and Nagelkerkes R2 scores and compared performance in SPAC to that achieved in the original population, the Leicester Respiratory Cohort (LRC).

ResultsAmong the 346 children included, 125 (36%) reported the outcome after 2 years. At a PARC score cut-off of 4, sensitivity was higher (95% vs 79%) but specificity lower (14% vs 57%) in SPAC compared to LRC. NPV was comparable (0.84 vs. 0.87) as was PPV (0.37 vs.0.42). Discrimination was lower in SPAC (AUC of 0.71 vs 0.78), as were Nagelkerkes R2 (0.18 vs 0.28) and scaled Briers scores (0.13 vs 0.22). When the outcome was changed to moderately severe asthma (>4 attacks plus use of asthma medication), there were improvements in AUC (0.74), sensitivity (0.97), specificity (0.22) and NPV (0.99), but some deterioration in PPV (0.13), R2 (0.15) and scaled Brier score (0.09).

ConclusionWhile the PARC tool performs well in a population-based setting and has some clinical utility, in particular for ruling out the development of asthma, this study highlights the need for new prognostic prediction tools to be developed specifically for the clinical setting.

Lastly, model interpretability was examined using an integrated gradient to identify pixels most likely to influence classification decisions.

ResultsThe precision and recall of the model during development testing were 0.92 and 1.00, respectively. In clinical validation, the model returned increasing positive signal with increasing mean reference value. However, there were two highly erroneous false positive values returned by the model. Lastly, the model incorrectly assessed three cases well above the clinical threshold of 10%.

Lastly, model interpretability was examined using an integrated gradient to identify pixels most likely to influence classification decisions.

ResultsThe precision and recall of the model during development testing were 0.92 and 1.00, respectively. In clinical validation, the model returned increasing positive signal with increasing mean reference value. However, there were two highly erroneous false positive values returned by the model. Lastly, the model incorrectly assessed three cases well above the clinical threshold of 10%. The integrated gradient suggested potential sources of false positives including rouleaux formations, cell boundaries, and precipitate as deterministic factors in negative erythrocyte images.

ConclusionsWhile the model demonstrated highly accurate single cell classification and correctly assessed most slides, several false positives were highly incorrect. This project highlights the need for integrated testing of ML-based models, even when models in the development phase perform well.",1,1

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs.

MethodWe use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the ""MosMedData"", which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs.

ResultsPointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases.

ConclusionThe PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources.

In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics. We evaluate the proposed models on widely adopted datasets, and we demonstrate an increase of approximately 4% and 7% for dice coefficient and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), respectively, while achieving 60% reduction in computational time, compared to the recent literature.",1,1

Existing COVID-19 forecasting models mainly rely on case counts, even though the binary PCR results provide a limited picture of the pandemic trajectory. Most forecasting models have failed to accurately predict the COVID-19 waves before they occur. Recently a model utilizing cross-sectional population cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from PCR tests (Ct-based model) was developed to overcome the limitations of using only binary PCR results. In this study, we aimed to improve on COVID-19 forecasting models using features derived from the Ct-based model, to detect epidemic waves earlier than case-based trajectories.

MethodsPCR data was collected weekly at Northeastern University (NU) between August 2020 and January 2022. The NU campus epidemic trajectories were generated from the campus incidence rates. In addition, epidemic trajectories were generated for Suffolk County, where NU is located, based on publicly available case-counts. A novel forecasting approach was developed by enhancing a recent deep learning model with Ct-based features, along with the models default features. For this, cross-sectional Ct values from PCR data were used to generate Ct-based epidemic trajectories, including effective reproductive rate (Rt) and incidence. The improvement in forecasting performance was compared using absolute errors and residual squared errors with respect to actual observed cases at the 7-day and 14-day forecasting horizons. The model was also tested prospectively over the period January 2022 to April 2022.

ResultsRt estimates from the Ct-based model preceded NU campus and Suffolk County cases by 12 and 14 days respectively, with a three-way synched Spearman correlation of 0.57. Enhancing the forecasting models with Ct-based information significantly decreased absolute error and residual squared error compared to the original model without Ct features (p-value <0.001 for both 7 and 14-days forecasting horizons).

ConclusionCt-based epidemic trajectories can herald an earlier signal for impending epidemic waves in the community and forecast transmission peaks. Moreover, COVID-19 forecasting models can be enhanced using these Ct features to improve their forecasting accuracy.

The PAVE strategy involves: 1) screening with self-sampled HPV testing; 2) triage of HPV-positive participants with a combination of extended genotyping and visual evaluation of the cervix assisted by deep-learning-based automated visual evaluation (AVE); and 3) treatment with thermal ablation or excision (Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone). The PAVE study has two phases: efficacy (2023-2024) and effectiveness (planned to begin in 2024-2025). The efficacy phase aims to refine and validate the screen-triage portion of the protocol. The effectiveness phase will examine acceptability and feasibility of the PAVE strategy into clinical practice, cost-effectiveness, and health communication within the PAVE sites.

Study designPhase 1 Efficacy: Around 100,000 nonpregnant women, aged 25-49 years, without prior hysterectomy, and irrespective of HIV status, are being screened at nine study sites in resource-limited settings. Eligible and consenting participants perform self-collection of vaginal specimens for HPV testing using a FLOQSwab (Copan). Swabs are transported dry and undergo testing for HPV using a newly-redesigned isothermal DNA amplification HPV test (ScreenFire HPV RS), which has been designed to provide HPV genotyping by hierarchical risk groups: HPV16, else HPV18/45, else HPV31/33/35/52/58, else HPV39/51/56/59/68. HPV-negative individuals are considered negative for precancer/cancer and do not undergo further testing. HPV-positive individuals undergo pelvic examination with collection of cervical images and targeted biopsies of all acetowhite areas or endocervical sampling in the absence of visible lesions. Accuracy of histology diagnosis is evaluated across all sites. Cervical images are used to refine a deep learning AVE algorithm that classifies images as normal, indeterminate, or precancer+. AVE classifications are validated against the histologic endpoint of high-grade precancer determined by biopsy. The combination of HPV genotype and AVE classification is used to generate a risk score that corresponds to the risk of precancer (lower, medium, high, highest). During the efficacy phase, clinicians and patients within the PAVE sites will receive HPV testing results but not AVE results or risk scores. Treatment during the efficacy phase will be performed per local standard of care: positive Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid impression, high-grade colposcopic impression or CIN2+ on colposcopic biopsy, HPV positivity, or HPV 16,18/45 positivity. Follow up of triage negative patients and post treatment will follow standard of care protocols. The sensitivity of the PAVE strategy for detection of precancer will be compared to current SOC at a given level of specificity.

Phase 2 Effectiveness: The AVE software will be downloaded to the new dedicated image analysis and thermal ablation devices (Liger Iris) into which the HPV genotype information can be entered to provide risk HPV-AVE risk scores for precancer to clinicians in real time. The effectiveness phase will examine clinician use of the PAVE strategy in practice, including feasibility and acceptability for clinicians and patients, cost-effectiveness, and health communication within the PAVE sites.

ConclusionThe goal of the PAVE study is to validate a screen-triage-treat protocol using novel biomarkers to provide an accurate, feasible, cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer prevention in resource-limited settings. If validated, implementation of PAVE at larger scale can be encouraged.

Moreover, short-term mortality risk reflects individual frailty and can serve as digital aging marker. Previous studies have focused on specific, high-risk populations. Predicting all-cause mortality in an unselected population incorporating both health and socioeconomic factors has direct public health relevance but requires careful fairness considerations.

MethodsWe developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (N = 5.4 million), including >8,000 features and spanning back up to 50 years. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a primary metric to assess model performance and fairness.

FindingsThe model achieved an AUC of 0.944 with strong calibration, outperforming a baseline model that only included age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC > 0.800 for 45 out of 50 causes), including COVID-19 which was not present in the training data.

The model performed best among young females and worst in older males (AUC = 0.910 vs. AUC = 0.718). Extensive fairness analyses revealed that individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged groups had the worst model performance, not explained by age and sex differences, reduced healthcare contact, or smaller training set sizes within these groups.

ConclusionA deep learning model based on nationwide longitudinal multi-modal data accurately identified short-term mortality risk holding the potential for developing a population-wide in-silico aging marker. Unfairness in model predictions represents a major challenge to the equitable integration of these approaches in public health interventions.",1,1

We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT ""DeepPavlov"", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines. Examining the sentinel properties of participatory trials (which is subject to self-reporting biases) could still provide meaningful information about pharmaceutics, especially if only a limited amount of information on AEs is provided by producers.",10.1101/2021.06.14.21258875,virology-llm.xlsx,"Mild Adverse Events of Sputnik V Vaccine Extracted from Russian Language Telegram Posts via BERT Deep Learning Model BackgroundThere is a limited amount of data on the COVID-19 vector vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) safety profile.

This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks.

MethodsWe study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on Twitter, Google, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 12.03.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group.

ResultsWe identified three temporal major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government ""declared war against disease"" with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify clear communities of governing party, mainstream oppostition and a protestant group and potential sources of disinformation. We have also detected bluring boundaries between comminities after disease introduction.

ConclusionsTraditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Due to filter ""bubbles"" observed on Twitter, public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.

DesignCross sectional study with cancer data provided by the National Cancer Registry and HIV data from the National Health Laboratory Service.

Setting and participantsThe NHLS is the largest provider of pathology services in the South African public sector with an estimated coverage of 80%. The NCR is a division of the NHLS. We included AYAs (aged 10-24 years) diagnosed with cancer by public health sector laboratories between 2004 and 2014 (n=8 479). We included 3 672 in the complete case analysis.

Primary and secondary outcomesWe used linked NCR and NHLS data to determine the spectrum of cancers by HIV status in AYAs. We also used multivariable logistic regression to describe the association of cancer in AYAs with HIV, adjusting for age, sex (as appropriate), ethnicity, and calendar period. Due to the large proportion of unknown HIV status we also imputed (post-hoc) the missing HIV status.

ResultsFrom 2004-2014, 8 479 AYAs were diagnosed with cancer, HIV status was known for only 45% (n=3812); of those whose status was known, about half were HIV positive (n=1853).

Significance statementThe opioid epidemic persists in the United States with over 80,000 deaths annually since 2021, primarily driven by synthetic opioids like fentanyl. As the geographic and demographic patterns of the opioid epidemic are rapidly changing, accurate and timely monitoring is needed. In this paper, we used social media data from Reddit to conduct public health surveillance of the opioid epidemic, following 1.5+ million geo-located users over 10+ years. We also found that near real-time Reddit data can improve our ability to predict future overdose death rates compared to models only using CDC data with typical half-year reporting delays. Our work suggests that social media can be a useful component for public health surveillance of the opioid epidemic.",1,1

Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic.

MethodsTo understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020.

ResultsWe identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was  thinking positively and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences.

ConclusionA variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.

There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).

ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester.

However due to the novelty of the disease there is very little disease specific data generated yet. This poses a difficult problem for machine learning methods to learn a model of the epidemic spread from data. A proposed ensemble of convolutional LSTM based spatiotemporal model can forecast the spread of the epidemic with high resolution and accuracy in a large geographic region. A data preparation method is proposed to convert available spatial causal features into set of 2D images with or without temporal component. The model has been trained with available data for USA and Italy. It achieved 5.57% and 0.3% mean absolute percent error for total number of predicted infection cases in a 5day prediction period for USA and Italy respectively.,1,0

Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted.

MethodsWe propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (ML-Sim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data.

FindingsMLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of Chinas mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in Chinas mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12.

ConclusionsMachine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.

In an imaginary world, we might develop a harmless biological virus that spreads just like COVID-19, but is traceable via a cheap and reliable diagnosis. By introducing such an imaginary virus into the population and observing how it spreads, we would have a way of learning about COVID-19 because the benign virus would respond to population behaviour and social distancing measures in a similar manner. Such a benign biological virus does not exist. Instead, we propose a safe and privacy-preserving digital alternative.

Our solution is to mimic the benign virus by passing virtual tokens between electronic devices when they move into close proximity.

In contrast to many app-based methods that inform individuals or governments about actual COVID-19 patients or hazards, Safe Blues does not provide information about individuals locations or contacts. Hence the privacy concerns associated with Safe Blues are much lower than other methods. However, from the point of view of data collection, Safe Blues has two major advantages:

Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies.

Due to the fact that most of the methods that have been proposed to COVID-19 diagnose deal with the lengthy testing time and also might give more false positive and false negative results, this paper aims to review and implement artificial intelligence (AI) image-based diagnosis methods in order to detect coronavirus infection with zero or near to zero false positives and false negatives rates. Besides the already existing AI image-based medical diagnosis method for the other well-known disease, this study aims on finding the most accurate COVID-19 detection method among AI methods such as machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN), ensemble learning (EL) methods.",1,0

Whether CNNs could also inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 analysing street images has been understudied, though it could identify high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. We trained CNNs to classify bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk.

MethodsWe used five images per bus stop. The outcome label (moderate or extreme) for each bus stop was extracted from the local transport authority. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2, and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing network which was further tuned to increase performance.

ResultsThere were 1,788 bus stops (1,173 moderate and 615 extreme), totalling 8,940 images. NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the extreme label: 57% versus 59% in NASNetLarge and ResNet152V2, respectively.

Whether CNNs could also inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 analysing street images has been understudied, though it could identify high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. We trained CNNs to classify bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk.

MethodsWe used five images per bus stop. The outcome label (moderate or extreme) for each bus stop was extracted from the local transport authority. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2, and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing network which was further tuned to increase performance.

ResultsThere were 1,788 bus stops (1,173 moderate and 615 extreme), totalling 8,940 images. NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the extreme label: 57% versus 59% in NASNetLarge and ResNet152V2, respectively. NASNetLarge was further tuned and reached: training loss of 0.50; training accuracy of 75%; precision, recall and F1 score for the moderate label of 80%, 83% and 82%, respectively; these metrics for the extreme label were 65%, 51% and 63%.

The initial lull following strict interventions in the first wave often led to a second wave, as restrictions were relaxed. We test the ability of new hybrid machine learning techniques, namely universal differential equations (UDEs) with learning biases, to make predictions in a such a dynamic behavior-disease setting. We develop a UDE model for COVID-19 and test it both with and without learning biases describing simple assumptions about disease transmission and population response. Our results show that UDEs, particularly when supplied with learning biases, are capable of learning coupled behavior-disease dynamics and predicting second waves in a variety of populations. The model predicts a second wave of infections 55% of the time across all populations, having been trained only on the first wave. The predicted second wave is larger than the first. Without learning biases, model predictions are hampered: the unbiased model predicts a second wave only 25% of the time, typically smaller than the first. The biased model consistently predicts the expected increase in the transmission rate with rising mobility, whereas the unbiased model predicts a decrease in mobility as often as a continued increase. The biased model also achieves better accuracy on its training data thanks to fewer and less severely divergent trajectories. These results indicate that biologically informed machine learning can generate qualitatively correct mid to long-term predictions of COVID-19 pandemic waves.

Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID-19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians.

MethodsIn this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID-19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions.

FindingsYounger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5{middle dot}58, 95% CI 4{middle dot}97-6{middle dot}25; p<0{middle dot}0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21{middle dot}09, 13{middle dot}64-32{middle dot}6; p<0{middle dot}0001) and obesity (aOR 21{middle dot}7, 95% CI not calculated; p<0{middle dot}0001), resulted in outstanding death risk.

InterpretationWe found evidence for increased COVID-19 risk in two distinct groups: younger patients with prevalent comorbidities, especially in brown ethnicity, and patients with black ethnicity. We speculate that the pro-inflammatory synergism of COVID-19 and comorbidities, promoting an overproduction of cytokines, is partially the cause of higher mortality in this young group. Brazilian black and brown are underprivileged populations, with structural social inequality, limited healthcare access and, thus, remarkable disease vulnerability.

Evidence before this studyCOVID-19 is still very active, having spread to over two hundred countries and caused more than one million deaths worldwide. Its current situation requires large-scale studies to assess the impact of preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, and socioeconomic issues regarding mortality rate, especially where lack of control is evident. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv on Dec 12, 2020, for studies published in English or Brazilian Portuguese, estimating the impact of several risk factors in COVID-19 prognosis. We used the search terms ""Brazil"" or ""risk factors"" or ""ethnicity"" or ""cohort"" or ""diabetes mellitus"" or ""mortality"" or ""symptoms"" or ""comorbidities"", and related synonyms, combined with ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"". Many pre-existing conditions have shown to directly impact patient prognosis, out of which cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, among others, are well established in SARS-CoV-2 infection severeness. Some studies reported an increased death risk for non-white Brazilians, but no large scale cohort analyzing the impact of one or more associated risk factors in younger Brazilians patients were found.

Added value of this studyWe found that the impact of having one or two or more risk factors on mortality are progressively higher in ages (60, 80], (40, 60], (20, 40], and (0, 20], compared with people of the same age interval without comorbidities. We also found that young brown individuals with diabetes, as well as black ethnicity on its own, are population subgroups at remarkably higher risk for severe COVID-19 in Brazil. Furthermore, advanced age, usage of ventilatory support, admission to intensive care units, multiple respiratory symptoms, and diagnosis previous to hospitalization were associated with higher death odds. As protective factors, we found hospitalization duration of (4, 7] days and illness onset to hospitalization over 6 days.

Implications of all the available evidenceWe identified multiple epidemiological profiles associated with death risk in different age ranges in Brazilian COVID-19 hospitalized patients. These findings unveil that a large part of Brazilian working-age population is at a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 death, a neglected situation that is further exacerbating inequalities, leading to a striking sociodemographic and economic impact. We hope that our analysis aids patient risk stratification, hospital management optimization, and public policy determination, including prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil.

Being a continental country, which comprises many ethnic groups and an engrained social inequality, the pandemic evidenced this heterogeneous discrepancy. We aimed to estimate the impact of associated risk factors, isolated or combined, on COVID-19 severeness, detecting specific epidemiological profiles for multiple age ranges in hospitalized Brazilians.

MethodsIn this large retrospective cohort study, we used open-access data from the Ministry of Health of Brazil with COVID-19 confirmed hospitalized patients annotated in SRAG system between February and August 2020, a total of 235555 entries. The association of COVID-19 death with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics was analysed and presented as odds ratios adjusted by confounding co-variables. We also presented marginal mean aOR values for high-order interactions either by or not another fixed level or condition. We kept all other variables in the multivariate logistic models in their mean values or equal proportions.

FindingsYounger individuals with one or more comorbidities had an adjusted odds ratio up to four-fold compared to those without it, in the same age interval. Younger diabetic patients either self-declared as brown ethnicity (aOR 5{middle dot}58, 95% CI 4{middle dot}97-6{middle dot}25; p<0{middle dot}0001) or with some other associated comorbidities, mainly chronic hematologic disease (21{middle dot}09, 13{middle dot}64-32{middle dot}6; p<0{middle dot}0001) and obesity (aOR 21{middle dot}7, 95% CI not calculated; p<0{middle dot}0001), resulted in outstanding death risk.

Besides, patients with severe COVID-19 have been reported to have increased levels of several immune mediators.

ObjectiveTo perform an immunoproteomic profiling of dysregulated plasma proteins in patients with asthma and COPD and to evaluate their relationship with biomarkers of severe COVID-19.

MethodsNinety-two proteins were quantified in 315 plasma samples from adult subjects (age 40-90 years) including 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls, that have been recruited in two reference pneumology clinics in Colombia before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Significant proteins were compared to the gene signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the ""COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set Library"" and with known protein biomarkers of severe COVID-19.

ResultsForty-one plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls. Asthmatic patients have increased levels in IL-6 while COPD patients have a broader systemic inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP-3, MCP-4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11).

The model can be used to explain slower approaching herd immunity in Sweden, than it was predicted by a variety of other mathematical models; see graphs Fig. 2. The hierarchic structure of social clusters is mathematically modeled with ultrametric spaces having treelike geometry. To simplify mathematics, we consider homogeneous trees with p-branches leaving each vertex. Such trees are endowed with algebraic structure, the p-adic number fields. We apply theory of the p-adic diffusion equation to describe coronavirus spread in hierarchically clustered population. This equation has applications to statistical physics and microbiology for modeling dynamics on energy landscapes. To move from one social cluster (valley) to another, the virus (its carrier) should cross a social barrier between them. The magnitude of a barrier depends on the number of social hierarchys levels composing this barrier. As the most appropriate for the recent situation in Sweden, we consider linearly increasing barriers. This structure matches with mild regulations in Sweden. The virus spreads rather easily inside a social cluster (say working collective), but jumps to other clusters are constrained by social barriers. This behavior matches with the covid-19 epidemic, with its cluster spreading structure. Our model differs crucially from the standard mathematical models of spread of disease, such as the SIR-model.

MethodsIt was a retrospective cohort study that incorporating the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. The prediction model was constructed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression method and the model was further tested in the validation cohort. The performance was evaluated by the receiver operating curve (ROC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA).

ResultsA total of 217 patients were included in the study. During the treatment, 34 patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and no developed death. A model incorporating the demographic and clinical characteristics, imaging features and laboratory findings were constructed to predict the critical ill probability and it was proved to have good calibration, discrimination ability and clinic use.

ConclusionsThe prevalence of critical ill was relatively high and the model may help the clinicians to identify the patients with high risk for developing the critical ill, thus to conduct timely and targeted treatment to reduce the mortality rate.",10.1101/2020.08.13.20173799,virology-vision-transformer.xlsx,"Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and the model for predicting the occurrence of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study.

P.",Epidemiology,2023-01-18 00:00:00 UTC,"Recent empirical evidence suggests that the transmission coefficient in susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-like (SEIR-like) models evolves with time, presenting random patterns, and some stylized facts, such as mean-reversion and jumps. To address such observations we propose the use of jump-diffusion stochastic processes to parameterize the transmission coefficient in an SEIR-like model that accounts for death and time-dependent parameters. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed model proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as studying its asymptotic behavior. We also compare the proposed model with some variations possibly including jumps. The forecast performance of the considered models, using reported COVID-19 infections from New York City, is then tested in different scenarios, including major outbreaks. The proposed jump-diffusion model presented remarkably accurate out-of-sample predictions, even during larger forecasted periods.",10.1101/2023.01.15.23284574,virology-vision-transformer.xlsx,"Stochastic Transmission in Epidemiological Models Recent empirical evidence suggests that the transmission coefficient in susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-like (SEIR-like) models evolves with time, presenting random patterns, and some stylized facts, such as mean-reversion and jumps.
