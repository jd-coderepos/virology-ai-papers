37039061,Apraxia and dementia severity in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review,"Vakkila E, Jehkonen M.",J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 2023 Feb;45(1):84-103. doi: 10.1080/13803395.2023.2199971. Epub 2023 Apr 11.,Vakkila E,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,2023,2023/04/11,,,10.1080/13803395.2023.2199971,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the role and influence of apraxia regarding dementia severity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, to examine whether apraxia or its association to dementia severity show distinct characteristics between typical and atypical variants of AD, that commonly include frontal, logopenic, posterior, and Down's syndrome variant.
METHOD: The search conducted on 4 December 2020 in the Cinahl, Ovid Medline, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, Scopus and Web of Science databases yielded 251 non-duplicate records published since 2000. Ten records examining the association between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores and apraxia in AD were included in the review.
RESULTS: Dementia severity was related to apraxia in AD, and the prevalence and severity of apraxia increased as dementia progressed. Constructional, ideomotor (imitation of meaningless gestures), orofacial, speech, gait, and total praxis, including constructional, ideomotor, and ideational praxis, tasks differentiated dementia severity in AD. In the atypical variants of AD apraxia occurred frequently but because of the small number of participants, no statistical analyses were available.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for extensive assessment of AD severity, and praxis assessment throughout the disease course. Apraxia affects the independent functioning and communication of the patient, tool use, and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Apraxia occurs frequently in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and apraxia assessment has shown to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly frontotemporal dementia. Thus, apraxia assessment serves in recognizing the atypical variants of AD as well."

Epub 2021 Jan 8.,Fotheringham L,Int Psychogeriatr,2022,2021/01/08,,,10.1017/S1041610220003804,"OBJECTIVES: Common mental disorders (CMDs), particularly depression, are major contributors to the global mental health burden. South Asia, while diverse, has cultural, social, and economic challenges, which are common across the region, not least an aging population. This creates an imperative to better understand how CMD affects older people in this context, which relies on valid and culturally appropriate screening and research tools. This review aims to scope the availability of CMD screening tools for older people in South Asia. As a secondary aim, this review will summarize the use of these tools in epidemiology, and the extent to which they have been validated or adapted for this population.
DESIGN: A scoping review was performed, following PRISMA guidelines. The search strategy was developed iteratively in Medline and translated to Embase, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data were extracted from papers in which a tool was used to identify CMD in a South Asian older population (50+), including validation, adaptation, and use in epidemiology. Validation studies meeting the criteria were critically appraised using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool.
RESULTS: Of the 4694 papers identified, 176 met the selection criteria at full-text screening as relevant examples of diagnostic or screening tool use. There were 15 tool validation studies, which were critically appraised. Of these, 10 were appropriate to evaluate as diagnostic tests. All of these tools assessed for depression. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)-based tools were predominant with variable diagnostic accuracy across different settings. Methodological issues were substantial based on the QUADAS-2 criteria. In the epidemiological studies identified (n = 160), depression alone was assessed for 82% of the studies. Tools lacking cultural validation were commonly used (43%).
CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies a number of current research gaps including a need for culturally relevant validation studies, and attention to other CMDs such as anxiety."

The more than 800 000 medics providing services in every county in the United States represent an important and underused surveillance system.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the Detection of Elder Mistreatment Through Emergency Care Technician (DETECT) screening tool use and the number of medic reports made to Adult Protective Services (APS) over a period of approximately 3 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study used a difference in difference in differences design and included adults aged 65 years and older who were reported to Texas APS in the study region (246 cities in Denton, Johnson, and Tarrant Counties) between December 31, 2014, and February 28, 2018.
EXPOSURES: The DETECT screening tool.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reports to APS.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 11 178 older adults included in this study was 76 (8) years (range, 65-105 years); there was no reported data on patient sex. A total of 18 080 reports of elder mistreatment were recorded. Medics within the study region reported more cases of elder mistreatment during the implementation of the screening tool (relative risk [RR], 4.14; 95% CI, 3.25-5.27). After adjusting for changes in the number of elder mistreatment reports in the comparison groups (ie, underlying changes in reporting trends), the number of reports to APS increased (RR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.06-4.46). The occurrence of elder mistreatment was validated in 83% (95% CI, 75%-91%) of the reports investigated by APS during the periods when medics did not have access to the screening tool compared with 82% (95% CI, 77%-87%) during the periods when medics had access to the screening tool, indicating that there were no differences in the proportion of reports that resulted in a validated APS investigation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that incorporating the DETECT screening tool into the routine practices of medics is associated with substantial increases in the frequency with which clinicians report potential cases of elder mistreatment to APS."

We explored the usability of a digital tool to support the diagnostic work-up in daily memory clinic practice. We evaluated four modules that integrate multi-modal patient data (1.cognitive test; cCOG, and 2. MRI quantification; cMRI) into useful diagnostic information for clinicians (3. cDSI) and understandable and personalized information for patients (4. patient report).
METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study in five Dutch memory clinics. Fourteen clinicians (11 geriatric specialists/residents, two neurologists, one nurse practitioner) were invited to integrate the tool into routine care with 43 new memory clinic patients. We evaluated usability and user experiences through quantitative data from questionnaires (patients, care partners, clinicians), enriched with thematically analyzed qualitative data from interviews (clinicians).
RESULTS: We observed wide variation in tool use among clinicians. Our core findings were that clinicians: 1) were mainly positive about the patient report, since it contributes to patient-centered and personalized communication. This was endorsed by patients and care partners, who indicated that the patient report was useful and understandable and helped them to better understand their diagnosis, 2) considered the tool acceptable in addition to their own clinical competence, 3) indicated that the usefulness of the tool depended on the patient population and purpose of the diagnostic process, 4) addressed facilitators (ease of use, practice makes perfect) and barriers (high workload, lack of experience, data unavailability).
CONCLUSION: This multicenter usability study revealed a willingness to adopt a digital tool to support the diagnostic process in memory clinics. Clinicians, patients, and care partners appreciated the personalized diagnostic report. More attention to education and training of clinicians is needed to utilize the full functionality of the tool and foster implementation in actual daily practice. These findings provide an important step towards a lasting adoption of digital tools in memory clinic practice."

Evidence-based practical lifestyle tools supporting patients and staff in improving patient lifestyle are lacking.
METHODS: This multi-site randomized controlled pragmatic trial determined the effectiveness of a twelve-month multimodal lifestyle approach, including a web-based tool to improve patients' cardiometabolic health, versus care-as-usual. Using the web tool, nurses (trained in motivational interviewing) assisted patients in assessing their lifestyle behaviours, creating a risk profile and constructing lifestyle goals, which were discussed during fortnightly regular care visits. Twenty-seven community-care and sheltered-living teams were randomized into intervention (N = 17) or control (N = 10) groups, including 244 patients (140 intervention/104 control, 49.2% male, 46.1 ± 10.8 years) with increased waist circumference (WC), BMI or fasting glucose. The primary outcomes concerned differences in WC after six and twelve months intervention, while BMI and metabolic syndrome Z-score were secondary outcome measures.
RESULTS: General multilevel linear mixed models adjusted for antipsychotic medication showed that differences in WC change between intervention and control were - 0.15 cm (95%CI: - 2.49; 2.19) after six and - 1.03 cm (95%CI: - 3.42; 1.35) after twelve months intervention; however, the differences were not statistically significant. No intervention effects were found for secondary outcome measures. The intervention increased patients' readiness to change dietary behaviour.
CONCLUSION: A multimodal web-based intervention facilitating nurses to address lifestyle changes in SMI patients did not improve patient cardiometabolic health. Web-tool use was lower than expected and nurses need more lifestyle coaching knowledge and skills. The type of intervention and delivery mode need optimization to realize effective lifestyle care for SMI patients.

36808815,Validation of the withdrawal assessment tool-1 (WAT-1) in pediatric cardiovascular patients on an inpatient unit,"McAlister S, Connor JA, Engstrand S, McLellan MC.",J Spec Pediatr Nurs. 2023 Apr;28(2):e12404. doi: 10.1111/jspn.12404. Epub 2023 Feb 20.,McAlister S,J Spec Pediatr Nurs,2023,2023/02/22,,,10.1111/jspn.12404,"PURPOSE: Sedation and analgesia are administered to critically ill patients, which may result in physical dependence and subsequent iatrogenic withdrawal. The Withdrawal Assessment Tool-1 (WAT-1) was developed and validated as an objective measurement of pediatric iatrogenic withdrawal in intensive care units (ICUs), with a WAT-1 score ≥ 3 indicative of withdrawal. This study's objectives were to test interrater reliability and validity of the WAT-1 in pediatric cardiovascular patients in a non-ICU setting.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted on a pediatric cardiac inpatient unit. WAT-1 assessments were performed by the patient's nurse and a blinded expert nurse rater. Intra-class correlation coefficients were calculated, and Kappa statistics were estimated. A two-sample, one-sided test of proportions of weaning (n = 30) and nonweaning (n = 30) patients with a WAT-1 ≥3 were compared.
RESULTS: Interrater reliability was low (K = 0.132). The WAT-1 area under the receiver operating curve was 0.764 (95% confidence interval; ± 0.123). There was a significantly higher proportion (50%, p = 0.009) of weaning patients with WAT-1 scores ≥3 compared to the nonweaning patients (10%). The WAT-1 elements of moderate/severe uncoordinated/repetitive movement and loose, watery stools were significantly higher in the weaning population.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Methods to improve interrater reliability warrant further examination. The WAT-1 had good discrimination at identifying withdrawal in cardiovascular patients on an acute cardiac care unit. Frequent nurse re-education may increase accurate tool use. The WAT-1 tool may be used in the management of iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric cardiovascular patients in a non-ICU setting."

METHODS: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO databases were searched from database inception to 9th March 2018. Specific criteria were used to define inclusion and exclusion. Data was extracted independently by a pair of reviewers.
RESULTS: In total 32 cross sectional studies were identified for inclusion (1 with a longitudinal component). The median prevalence of wrist pain in the general population and non-manual workers within the short term (within last week) was 6 and 4.2% within the medium term (> 1 week and within a year). The median prevalence of wrist pain in physically demanding occupations and sports people was 10% within the short term and 24% within the medium term. Non-modifiable factors associated with wrist pain included increased age (1 study in adults and 3 studies in children/adolescents) and female sex (2 studies). Modifiable risk factors included high job physical strain (2 studies), high job psychological strain (1 study), abnormal physeal morphology in children/adolescents (2 studies), high frequency impact tool use (1 study) and effort reward imbalance (1 study).
CONCLUSIONS: Wrist pain is highly prevalent in groups who partake in physically demanding activities from day to day such as manual labourers and sportspeople. It is less prevalent in the general population and non-manual workers, although there is a relative lack of research in the general population.

The objective was to compare the utility of qSOFA to the St. John Sepsis Surveillance Agent among patients with suspected infection. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality or admission to the intensive care unit. A multiple center observational cohort study design was used. The study population comprised 17 044 hospitalized patients between January and March 2016. For the primary analysis, receiver operator characteristic curves were constructed for patient outcomes using qSOFA and the St. John Sepsis Surveillance Agent, and the areas under the curve were compared against a baseline risk model. Time-to-event clinical process modeling also was applied. The St. John Sepsis Surveillance Agent, when compared to qSOFA, activated earlier and was more accurate in predicting patient outcomes; in this regard, qSOFA fell far behind on both objectives."

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Our computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was based on a literature review and validated through discussion with experts and performance of a pretest, pilot test, and retest. Content validity was evaluated by occupational health, optometry, and ophthalmology experts. Rasch analysis was used in the psychometric evaluation of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was determined by calculating the sensitivity and specificity, receiver operator characteristic curve, and cutoff point. Test-retest repeatability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and concordance by Cohen's kappa (κ).
RESULTS: The CVS-Q was developed with wide consensus among experts and was well accepted by the target group. It assesses the frequency and intensity of 16 symptoms using a single rating scale (symptom severity) that fits the Rasch rating scale model well. The questionnaire has sensitivity and specificity over 70% and achieved good test-retest repeatability both for the scores obtained [ICC = 0.802; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.673, 0.884] and CVS classification (κ = 0.612; 95% CI: 0.384, 0.839).
CONCLUSION: The CVS-Q has acceptable psychometric properties, making it a valid and reliable tool to control the visual health of computer workers, and can potentially be used in clinical trials and outcome research."

The DL-based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high-level decision-making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements.

Clinically, AMD initially affects the central area of retina known as the macula and it is classified as early stage to late stage (advanced AMD). The advanced AMD is classified into the nonexudative or atrophic form (dry AMD) and the exudative or neovascular form (wet AMD). More severe vision loss is typically associated with the wet form. Multiple genetic factors, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and aging, play a role in the etiology of AMD. Dysregulation in genetic to AMD is established to 46%-71% of disease contribution, with CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1 to be the two most notable risk loci among the 103 identified AMD associated loci so far. Chronic cigarette smoking is the most proven consistently risk living habits for AMD. Deep learning algorithm has been developed based on image recognition to distinguish wet AMD and normal macula with high accuracy. Currently, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is highly effective at treating wet AMD. Several new generation AMD drugs and iPSC-derived RPE cell therapy are in the clinical trial stage and are promising to improve AMD treatment in the near future."

After the definition of texture parameters (shape features; first-, second-, and higher-order features), we briefly discuss the origin of the term radiomics and the methods for selecting the parameters useful for a radiomic approach, including cluster analysis, principal component analysis, random forest, neural network, linear/logistic regression, and other. Reproducibility and clinical value of parameters should be firstly tested with internal cross-validation and then validated on independent external cohorts.

Epub 2022 Feb 4.,Kamøy B,Acta Ophthalmol,2022,2022/02/05,PMC9790652,,10.1111/aos.15105,"BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease (DED) is a common cause of ocular pain and discomfort. Dry eye disease (DED) stems from a loss-of-tear film homeostasis and is frequently seen in video display terminal (VDT) users. Video display terminal (VDT) use reduces blink rates and increases incomplete blinks, leading to tear film instability and ocular inflammation, promoting DED.
PURPOSE: To assess and evaluate the methods for preventing VDT-associated DED and ocular discomfort.
METHODS: Studies were found using PubMed and Embase with the search terms: (digital visual terminal* OR computer use OR screen use OR smartphone OR display OR visual display terminal* OR computer vision syndrome OR tablet OR phone OR screen time) AND (dry eye OR DED).
RESULTS: Thirty-one relevant articles were found. Ten described single-visit studies, whereas 21 had a prolonged follow-up. Most preventive measures of VDT-associated DED aimed to increase blink rate or directly prevent tear film instability, ocular inflammation, mucin loss or ocular surface damage. Using an adjustable chair and ergonomic training, blink animations and omega-3 supplementation improved signs and symptoms of VDT-associated DED. Taking frequent breaks was associated with fewer symptoms, but no study assessed the commonly suggested 20-20-20 rule.
CONCLUSION: Preventive measures, such as blink animation programmes, oral intake of omega-3 fatty acids and improved ergonomics act on different parts of the vicious cycle of dry eye and could supplement each other. A comparison of the efficacy of the different interventions as well as more evidence of the effect of increased humidity, VDT filters and ergonomic practices, are required."

Examples of potential high-value machine learning applications include both model-based assessment of routine diagnostic features in pathology, and the ability to extract and identify novel features that provide insights into a disease. Recent groundbreaking results have demonstrated that applications of machine learning methods in pathology significantly improves metastases detection in lymph nodes, Ki67 scoring in breast cancer, Gleason grading in prostate cancer and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring in melanoma. Furthermore, deep learning models have also been demonstrated to be able to predict status of some molecular markers in lung, prostate, gastric and colorectal cancer based on standard HE slides. Moreover, prognostic (survival outcomes) deep neural network models based on digitized HE slides have been demonstrated in several diseases, including lung cancer, melanoma and glioma. In this review, we aim to present and summarize the latest developments in digital image analysis and in the application of artificial intelligence in diagnostic pathology."

""Computer vision syndrome"" originally related to the few professionals exposed to long hours of work in front of a computer screen. The widespread use of digital screens in devices used throughout the day have led to the emergence of ""digital eye strain"" as a new clinical syndrome that affects every individual who spends a large period of time fixated on multiple screens, for work or leisure. A new subcategory, ""video game vision"" has been proposed to specifically address vision issues related to large periods of continuous use of screen enabled devices in order to play video games. With gaming disorder being included in the next version of the WHO classification of diseases (ICD-11), it is becoming increasingly important to have a clear idea of the impact of this disorder in general health and functioning. At the same time, a number of research studies have reported positive impact of videogame playing on the players vision. This article reviews the latest research studies on the impact of digital screen enabled devices on adolescent vision in light of the increasing reports of internet addiction and gaming disorder while referencing positive findings of videogaming on vision in order to provide a balanced approach and assist with classification, diagnosis and treatment, while providing directions for future research."

Artificial intelligence-based diagnostic support systems, in particular convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image analysis tools, have shown great potential in medical computer vision. In this systematic review, we summarise recent studies reporting CNN-based approaches for digital biomarkers for characterization and prognostication of gastrointestinal cancer pathology.
METHODS: Pubmed and Medline were screened for peer-reviewed papers dealing with CNN-based gastrointestinal cancer analyses from histological slides, published between 2015 and 2020.Seven hundred and ninety titles and abstracts were screened, and 58 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility.
RESULTS: Sixteen publications fulfilled our inclusion criteria dealing with tumor or precursor lesion characterization or prognostic and predictive biomarkers: 14 studies on colorectal or rectal cancer, three studies on gastric cancer and none on esophageal cancer. These studies were categorised according to their end-points: polyp characterization, tumor characterization and patient outcome. Regarding the translation into clinical practice, we identified several studies demonstrating generalization of the classifier with external tests and comparisons with pathologists, but none presenting clinical implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of recent studies on CNN-based image analysis in gastrointestinal cancer pathology are promising, but studies were conducted in observational and retrospective settings. Large-scale trials are needed to assess performance and predict clinical usefulness. Furthermore, large-scale trials are required for approval of CNN-based prediction models as medical devices."

However, in this self-reporting technique, the food types and the portion size reported highly depends on users' subjective judgement which may lead to a biased and inaccurate dietary analysis result. As a result, a variety of visual-based dietary assessment approaches have been proposed recently. While these methods show promises in tackling issues in nutritional epidemiology studies, several challenges and forthcoming opportunities, as detailed in this study, still exist. This study provides an overview of computing algorithms, mathematical models and methodologies used in the field of image-based dietary assessment. It also provides a comprehensive comparison of the state of the art approaches in food recognition and volume/weight estimation in terms of their processing speed, model accuracy, efficiency and constraints. It will be followed by a discussion on deep learning method and its efficacy in dietary assessment. After a comprehensive exploration, we found that integrated dietary assessment systems combining with different approaches could be the potential solution to tackling the challenges in accurate dietary intake assessment."

This improvement in resolution has been the result of direct electron detectors and image processing advances. Although enforcing symmetry facilitates reaching near-atomic resolution with fewer particle images, it unfortunately obscures some biologically interesting components of a virus. New approaches on relaxing symmetry and exploring structure dynamics and heterogeneity of viral assemblies have revealed important insights into genome packaging, virion assembly, cell entry, and other stages of the viral life cycle. In the future, novel methods will be required to reveal yet-unknown structural conformations of viruses, relevant to their biological activities. Ultimately, these results hold the promise of answering many unresolved questions linking structural diversity of viruses to their biological functions."

METHODS: 2333 hematoxylin and eosin-stained pathological pictures of 1037 GC patients were collected from two cohorts to develop our algorithms, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, we gained 175 digital pictures of 91 GC patients from National Human Genetic Resources Sharing Service Platform (NHGRP), served as the independent external validation set. Two models were developed using artificial intelligence (AI), one named GastroMIL for diagnosing GC, and the other named MIL-GC for predicting outcome of GC.
FINDINGS: The discriminatory power of GastroMIL achieved accuracy 0.920 in the external validation set, superior to that of the junior pathologist and comparable to that of expert pathologists. In the prognostic model, C-indices for survival prediction of internal and external validation sets were 0.671 and 0.657, respectively. Moreover, the risk score output by MIL-GC in the external validation set was proved to be a strong predictor of OS both in the univariate (HR = 2.414, P < 0.0001) and multivariable (HR = 1.803, P = 0.043) analyses. The predicting process is available at an online website (https://baigao.github.io/Pathologic-Prognostic-Analysis/).
INTERPRETATION: Our study developed AI models and contributed to predicting precise diagnosis and prognosis of GC patients, which will offer assistance to choose appropriate treatment to improve the survival status of GC patients.

Since the first documented classification scale developed in 1843, there have been numerous attempts to classify the iris colour. In the past centuries, iris colour classification scales has had various colour categories and mostly relied on comparison of an individual's eye with painted glass eyes. Once photography techniques were refined, standard iris photographs replaced painted eyes, but this did not solve the problem of painted/ printed colour variability in time. Early clinical scales were easy to use, but lacked objectivity and were not standardised or statistically tested for reproducibility. The era of automated iris colour classification systems came with the technological development. Spectrophotometry, digital analysis of high-resolution iris images, hyper spectral analysis of the human real iris and the dedicated iris colour analysis software, all accomplished an objective, accurate iris colour classification, but are quite expensive and limited in use to research environment. Iris colour classification systems evolved continuously due to their use in a wide range of studies, especially in the fields of anthropology, epidemiology and genetics. Despite the wide range of the existing scales, up until present there has been no generally accepted iris colour classification scale."

The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area."

The ease with which this type of coronavirus can spread has exposed weaknesses of many healthcare systems around the world. Since its emergence, many governments, research communities, commercial enterprises, and other institutions and stakeholders around the world have been fighting in various ways to curb the spread of the disease. Science and technology have helped in the implementation of policies of many governments that are directed toward mitigating the impacts of the pandemic and in diagnosing and providing care for the disease. Recent technological tools, artificial intelligence (AI) tools in particular, have also been explored to track the spread of the coronavirus, identify patients with high mortality risk and diagnose patients for the disease. In this paper, areas where AI techniques are being used in the detection, diagnosis and epidemiological predictions, forecasting and social control for combating COVID-19 are discussed, highlighting areas of successful applications and underscoring issues that need to be addressed to achieve significant progress in battling COVID-19 and future pandemics. Several AI systems have been developed for diagnosing COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest CT and X-ray images. These AI systems mainly differ in their choices of the algorithms for image segmentation, classification and disease diagnosis. Other AI-based systems have focused on predicting mortality rate, long-term patient hospitalization and patient outcomes for COVID-19. AI has huge potential in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic but successful practical deployments of these AI-based tools have so far been limited due to challenges such as limited data accessibility, the need for external evaluation of AI models, the lack of awareness of AI experts of the regulatory landscape governing the deployment of AI tools in healthcare, the need for clinicians and other experts to work with AI experts in a multidisciplinary context and the need to address public concerns over data collection, privacy, and protection. Having a dedicated team with expertise in medical data collection, privacy, access and sharing, using federated learning whereby AI scientists hand over training algorithms to the healthcare institutions to train models locally, and taking full advantage of biomedical data stored in biobanks can alleviate some of problems posed by these challenges.

Deep learning has shown promise in automating image segmentation in radiology, including for malignant bone lesions. The purpose of this review is to investigate deep learning-based image segmentation methods for malignant bone lesions on Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron-Emission Tomography/CT (PET/CT).
METHOD: The literature search of deep learning-based image segmentation of malignant bony lesions on CT and MRI was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A total of 41 original articles published between February 2017 and March 2023 were included in the review.
RESULTS: The majority of papers studied MRI, followed by CT, PET/CT, and PET/MRI. There was relatively even distribution of papers studying primary vs. secondary malignancies, as well as utilizing 3-dimensional vs. 2-dimensional data. Many papers utilize custom built models as a modification or variation of U-Net. The most common metric for evaluation was the dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Most models achieved a DSC above 0.6, with medians for all imaging modalities between 0.85-0.9.
DISCUSSION: Deep learning methods show promising ability to segment malignant osseous lesions on CT, MRI, and PET/CT. Some strategies which are commonly applied to help improve performance include data augmentation, utilization of large public datasets, preprocessing including denoising and cropping, and U-Net architecture modification. Future directions include overcoming dataset and annotation homogeneity and generalizing for clinical applicability."

The purpose of our study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analyses of the risk of ASD in newborns following air pollution exposure during the perinatal period (preconception to second year of life). The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and ScienceDirect databases were searched for articles, published up to July 2020, with the keywords ""air pollution"" and ""autism"". Three models were used for each meta-analysis: a global model based on all risks listed in included articles, a pessimistic model based on less favorable data only, and an optimistic model based on the most favorable data only. 28 studies corresponding to a total of 758 997 newborns were included (47190 ASD and 703980 controls). Maternal exposure to all pollutants was associated with an increased risk of ASD in newborns by 3.9% using the global model and by 12.3% using the optimistic model, while the pessimistic model found no change. Each increase of 5 μg/m3 in particulate matter &lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) was associated with an increased risk of ASD in newborns, regardless of the model used (global +7%, pessimistic +5%, optimistic +15%). This risk increased during preconception (global +17%), during pregnancy (global +5%, and optimistic +16%), and during the postnatal period (global +11% and optimistic +16%). Evidence levels were poor for other pollutants (PM10, NOx, O3, metals, solvents, styrene, PAHs, pesticides). PM2.5 was associated with a greater risk than PM10 (coefficient 0.20, 95CI -0.02 to 0.42), NOx (0.29, 0.08 to 0.50) or solvents (0.24, 0.04 to 0.44). All models revealed that exposure to pollutants, notably PM2.5 during pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of ASD in newborns. Pregnancy and postnatal periods seem to be the most at-risk periods."

This advanced three-dimensional imaging technique of vitreous samples in near-native state has matured over the past two decades and proven powerful in revealing molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication. Initial studies were restricted to cell peripheries and typically focused on early infection steps, analyzing surface proteins and viral entry. Recent developments including cryo-thinning techniques, phase-plate imaging, and correlative approaches have been instrumental in also targeting rare events inside infected cells. When combined with advances in dedicated image analyses and processing methods, details of virus assembly and egress at (sub)nanometer resolution were uncovered. Altogether, we provide a historical and technical perspective and discuss future directions and impacts of cryoET for integrative structural cell biology analyses of viruses."

Of the available functional imaging tests, [18F]FDG-PET for body lymphoma and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) for central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma are of particular interest. The current literature suggests that two main applications for radiomics in lymphoma show promise: differentiation of lymphomas from other tumors, and lymphoma treatment response and outcome prognostication. In particular, encouraging results reported in the limited number of presently available studies that utilize functional imaging suggest that (1) MRI-based radiomics enables differentiation of CNS lymphoma from glioblastoma, and (2) baseline [18F]FDG-PET radiomics could be useful for survival prognostication, adding to or even replacing commonly used metrics such as standardized uptake values and metabolic tumor volume. However, due to differences in biological and clinical characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes and an increasing number of treatment options, more data are required to support these findings. Furthermore, a consensus on several critical steps in the radiomics workflow -most importantly, image reconstruction and post processing, lesion segmentation, and choice of classification algorithm- is desirable to ensure comparability of results between research institutions."

DESIGN: We searched four databases for articles published between January 2010 and December 2015 comparing CAD of PTB on CXR to a microbiologic reference standard (smear, culture or polymerase chain reaction). We collected and summarised data on study design, CAD software and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve [AUC]).
RESULTS: We included 5 of 455 articles identified by searching databases. PTB prevalence ranged from 18% to 60%, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence from 33% to 68%. All articles evaluated CAD4TB, the only commercially available software. AUC ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. Software settings that increased sensitivity resulted in important reductions in specificity, and vice versa. Risk of bias was low in prospective studies (n = 2), and high in retrospective studies (n = 3).
CONCLUSION: Evidence assessing CAD's diagnostic accuracy is limited by the small number of studies, most of which have important methodological limitations, the availability and evaluation of only one software programme, and limited generalisability to settings where PTB and HIV are less prevalent. Additional research is required."

Although airport baggage handlers exhibit a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints the amount of biomechanical research within this and similar areas is limited. The aims of this thesis were to perform a general description of the lumbar loading in baggage handlers (Paper I), to develop a generically useful tool to examine specific lumbar compression in a valid manner (Paper II & III), and to investigate the spinal loading in common work tasks for baggage handlers. (Paper III). We recorded electromyography during baggage handling in the baggage hall, by a conveyor, and inside the aircraft baggage compartment. Electromyography was analyzed using amplitude probability distribution functions (APDF) on both tasks and full day recordings and root mean square (RMS) values on tasks. Furthermore, we estimated L4/L5 compression and moment along with shoulder flexor moment with a Watbak model based on more specific subtasks. In addition, we built an inverse dynamics-based musculoskeletal computer model using the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS). Motion capture recorded the movements in 3D during a stooped and a kneeling lifting task simulating airport baggage handler work. Marker trajectories were used to drive the model. The AMS-models computed estimated compression forces, shear forces and the moments around the L4/L5 joint. The compression forces were used for comparison with the vertebral compression tolerances reported in the literature. The RMS muscle activity was high in all tasks. The average peak RMS muscle activity was up to 120% EMGmax in the erector spinae during the baggage hall task. There were no significant differences between the tasks in the APDF analyses. The L4/L5 compression and extensor moment from Watbak were significantly higher in the baggage compartment task than in both the conveyor and baggage hall tasks. The stooped lifting task produced 5,541 N compression in the L4/L5 joint and a kneeling task produced 4,197 N in the AMS models. These compression forces were close to the average compression tolerance and exceed the recommended limits for compression during lifting."

Consequently, a timely and cost-effective evaluation of imaging data is hardly feasible without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can facilitate and shorten various time-consuming steps in the image processing workflow, e.g., tumor segmentation, thereby optimizing productivity. Besides, the automated and computer-based analysis of imaging data may help to increase data comparability as it is independent of the experience level of the evaluating clinician. Importantly, AI offers the potential to extract new features from the routinely acquired neuroimages of brain tumor patients. In combination with patient data such as survival, molecular markers, or genomics, mathematical models can be generated that allow, for example, the prediction of treatment response or prognosis, as well as the noninvasive assessment of molecular markers. The subdiscipline of AI dealing with the computation, identification, and extraction of image features, as well as the generation of prognostic or predictive mathematical models, is termed radiomics. This review article summarizes the basics, the current workflow, and methods used in radiomics with a focus on feature-based radiomics in neuro-oncology and provides selected examples of its clinical application."

The typical radiomic workflow includes image acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction, and analysis of high-dimensional datasets. While procedures for primary radiomic analyses have been established in recent years, processing the resulting radiomic datasets remains a challenge due to the lack of specific tools for doing so. Here we present RadAR (Radiomics Analysis with R), a new software to perform comprehensive analysis of radiomic features. RadAR allows users to process radiomic datasets in their entirety, from data import to feature processing and visualization, and implements multiple statistical methods for analysis of these data. We used RadAR to analyze the radiomic profiles of more than 850 patients with cancer from publicly available datasets and showed that it was able to recapitulate expected results. These results demonstrate RadAR as a reliable and valuable tool for the radiomics community. SIGNIFICANCE: A new computational tool performs comprehensive analysis of high-dimensional radiomic datasets, recapitulating expected results in the analysis of radiomic profiles of >850 patients with cancer from independent datasets."

The purpose of this paper is to critically discuss the literature on sex differences in eating behavior in children and present new findings supporting the role of sex in child appetitive traits and neural responses to food cues. In children, the literature shows sex differences in food acceptance, food intake, appetitive traits, eating-related compensation, and eating speed. New analyses demonstrate that sex interacts with child weight status to differentially influence appetitive traits. Further, results from neuroimaging suggest that obesity in female children is positively related to neural reactivity to higher-energy-dense food cues in regions involved with contextual processing and object recognition, while the opposite was found in males. In addition to differences in how the brain processes information about food, other factors that may contribute to sex differences include parental feeding practices, societal emphasis on dieting, and peer influences. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings, as they may have implications for the development of effective intervention programs to improve dietary behaviors and prevent obesity."

We reviewed and discussed the selected investigations following the radiomics workflow steps related to the clinical, technical, analysis, and reporting issues. Most of the current evidence on the clinical role of PET/CT radiomics in breast cancer is at the feasibility level. Harmonized methods in image acquisition, post-processing and features calculation, predictive models and classifiers trained and validated on sufficiently representative datasets, adherence to consensus guidelines, and transparent reporting will give validity and generalizability to the results."

On the other hand, the pandemic has impacted and even changed human behavior in almost every aspect. To provide a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between human behavior and the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been employing big data techniques such as natural language processing, computer vision, audio signal processing, frequent pattern mining, and machine learning. In this study, we present an overview of the existing studies on using big data techniques to study human behavior in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we categorize these studies into three groups-using big data to measure, model, and leverage human behavior, respectively. The related tasks, data, and methods are summarized accordingly.

Currently, INS cannot be cured, but its effects can potentially be treated pharmacologically, optically, or surgically. This review focuses on the surgical interventions for INS. Despite the range of surgical interventions available, and currently applied in practice for the management of INS, there is no clear consensus, and no accepted clinical guidelines regarding the relative efficacy and safety of the various treatment options. A better understanding of these surgical options, along with their associated side effects, will assist clinicians in evidence-based decision-making in relation to the management of INS.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to 3 July 2020, with no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) studying the efficacy and safety of surgical options for treating INS.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our prespecified outcome measures were the change from baseline in: binocular best-corrected distance visual acuity; head posture; amplitude, frequency, intensity, and foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform; visual recognition times; quality of life and self-reported outcome measures; incidence of adverse effects with a probable causal link to treatment; and permanent adverse effects after surgery. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data from eligible RCTs, and judged the risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. We reached consensus on any disagreements by discussion. We summarised the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We only identified one eligible RCT (N = 10 participants), undertaken in India. This trial randomised participants to receive either a large retro-equatorial recession of the horizontal rectus muscle of 9 mm on the medial rectus and 12 mm on the lateral rectus, or a simple tenotomy and resuturing of the four horizontal rectus muscles. We did not identify any RCTs comparing a surgical intervention for INS relative to no treatment. In the single eligible RCT, both eyes of each participant received the same intervention. The participants' age and gender were not reported, nor was information on whether participants were idiopathic or had sensory disorders. The study only included participants with null in primary position and did not explicitly exclude those with congenital periodic alternating nystagmus. The study did not report funding source(s) or author declaration of interests. The evaluation period was six months. We judged this study at low risk for sequence generation and other sources of bias, but at high risk of bias for performance and detection bias. The risk of bias was unclear for selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. There is very uncertain evidence about the effect of the interventions on visual acuity and change in amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the nystagmus waveform. We were unable to calculate relative effects due to lack of data. None of the participants in either intervention group reported adverse effects at six-month follow-up (very low-certainty evidence). There was no quantitative data reported for quality of life, although the study reported an improvement in quality of life after surgery in both intervention groups (very low-certainty evidence). Change in head posture, foveation period durations of the nystagmus waveform, visual recognition times, and permanent adverse effects after surgery were not reported in the included study. We judged the certainty of the evidence, for both the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes, to be very low. Due to a lack of comprehensive reporting of adverse events, there was also very low-certainty of the safety profile of the evaluated surgical interventions in this population. As such, we are very uncertain about the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions for the surgical management of INS.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified minimal high-quality evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions for INS. The limited availability of evidence must be considered by clinicians when treating INS, particularly given these procedures are irreversible and often performed on children. More high-quality RCTs are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of surgical interventions for INS. This will assist clinicians, people with INS, and their parents or caregivers to make evidence-based treatment decisions."

The explanation of this high comorbidity has remained a scientific puzzle. We propose 'disrupted emotion processing' as a liability spectrum that underlies many different mental disorders. Emotion processing deficits have been reported in different disorders and result in difficulties in regulating emotions and at the perceptual level in attentional biases and impaired recognition of emotional expressions. This article provides a detailed overview of the literature on disrupted emotion processing in clinical groups on the behavioral and neurological level. In the discussion, the similarities and differences between these disorders are discussed in the context of common neuro-endocrine, genetic and environmental factors and ideas are put forward on how future research may advance. Most importantly, more interdisciplinary research is needed in which different techniques, tasks and clinical populations are combined to get a better understanding of disrupted emotion processing as a liability spectrum underlying various different mental disorders."

Here we used ACE2-transgenic mice recovered from Omicron (BA.1) infection to test for pulmonary and behavioral post-acute sequelae. Through in-depth phenotyping by CyTOF, we demonstrate that naïve mice experiencing a first Omicron infection exhibit profound immune perturbations in the lung after resolving acute infection. This is not observed if mice were first vaccinated with spike-encoding mRNA. The protective effects of vaccination against post-acute sequelae were associated with a highly polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response that was recalled upon BA.1 breakthrough infection but not seen with BA.1 infection alone. Without vaccination, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 was uniquely upregulated on multiple pulmonary immune subsets in the BA.1 convalescent mice, a process previously connected to severe COVID-19. Taking advantage of recent developments in machine learning and computer vision, we demonstrate that BA.1 convalescent mice exhibited spontaneous behavioral changes, emotional alterations, and cognitive-related deficits in context habituation. Collectively, our data identify immunological and behavioral post-acute sequelae after Omicron infection and uncover a protective effect of vaccination against post-acute pulmonary immune perturbations."

Patients who require prolonged isolation until recovery, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, present multiple therapeutic dilemmas to their caregivers. Therefore, utilizing remote care in the daily workflow would be a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic ocular conditions in this challenging clinical setting. Our aim is to review the latest technological and methodical advances in teleophthalmology and highlight their implementation in screening and managing various ocular conditions. We present them as well as potential diagnostic and treatment applications in view of the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak.
METHODS: A computerized search from January 2017 up to March 2020 of the online electronic database PubMed was performed, using the following search strings: ""telemedicine,"" ""telehealth,"" and ""ophthalmology."" More generalized complementary contemporary research data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was also obtained from the PubMed database.
RESULTS: A total of 312 records, including COVID-19-focused studies, were initially identified. After exclusion of non-relevant, non-English, and duplicate studies, a total of 138 records were found eligible. Ninety records were included in the final qualitative analysis.
CONCLUSION: Teleophthalmology is an effective screening and management tool for a range of adult and pediatric acute and chronic ocular conditions. It is mostly utilized in screening of retinal conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration; in diagnosing anterior segment condition; and in managing glaucoma. With improvements in image processing, and better integration of the patient's medical record, teleophthalmology should become a more accepted modality, all the more so in circumstances where social distancing is inflicted upon us."

However, subtle radiologic findings suggestive of IIH have emerged with modern neuroimaging. This review provides a detailed description of the imaging findings reported in IIH and discusses their possible roles in the pathophysiology and the diagnosis of IIH.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: References were identified by searches of PubMed from 1955 to January 2015, with the terms ""idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"" ""pseudotumor cerebri,"" ""intracranial hypertension,"" ""benign intracranial hypertension,"" ""magnetic resonance imaging,"" ""magnetic resonance venography,"" ""computed tomography (CT),"" ""CT venography,"" ""imaging,"" and ""cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak."" Additional references were identified by hand search of relevant articles. When possible, we extracted the number of patients and control subjects from each study for each radiological finding. When at least 2 studies used the same criteria to define a radiological finding, all patients from these studies were pooled to obtain a mean sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: Specific neuroimaging findings may suggest long-standing IIH, including empty sella, flattening of the posterior globes, optic nerve head protrusion, distention of the optic nerve sheaths, tortuosity of the optic nerve, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, meningoceles, CSF leaks, and transverse venous sinus stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Although IIH remains a diagnosis of exclusion, the most recently proposed diagnostic criteria have included neuroimaging findings to suggest IIH when major diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled. However, these findings are not diagnostic of IIH, and their presence is not required for the diagnosis of definite IIH. Their incidental discovery on brain imaging should not prompt invasive procedures, unless other signs of IIH, such as papilledema, are present."

However, the definition and frequency with which it occurs in screening trials remains unclear. This lack of clarity stems from its current definition which is not based on a clinical grounds but instead on an epidemiologic definition that depends on the cause of death. Thus, with the current definition an overdiagnosed cancer can only be diagnosed if the person does not die from the cancer, regardless of whether or not the cancer is aggressive or the treatment successful. Using a definition based on epidemiology rather than the clinical presentation is highly unusual. Furthermore, the frequency of overdiagnosis has also been a cause of great confusion. Prior to the results from the National Lung Screening trial (NLST), concerns were expressed that virtually all CT screen detected cancers would be overdiagnosed, yet the extended follow-up study of the National Lung Screening Trial shows that in essence there were virtually no overdiagnosis. Even more confusing is that it was previously suspected that there was a high rate of overdiagnosis when using chest radiographic screening and therefore as CT is a more sensitive imaging test and finds cancers even earlier, it would be presumed that the overdiagnosis rate for CT would be even be higher. A proposed change in the definition would focus more on the clinical manifestation of the cancer as to its aggressiveness as this can be diagnosed while the patient is alive. Using a definition that is based on clinical features, a cancer that manifests as a nonsolid nodule would be considered overdiagnosed if instead of being recognized as relatively indolent was instead thought to be an aggressive cancer. The concept of overtreatment arises if this nonaggressive cancer were treated aggressively."

Epub 2015 Jun 26.,Gleichgerrcht E,Neurology,2015,2015/06/28,PMC4516297,,10.1212/WNL.0000000000001765,"The ability to name objects or abstract entities is an essential feature of speech and language, being commonly considered a central component of normal neurologic function. For this reason, the bedside testing of naming performance is part of the neurologic examination, especially since naming impairments can signify the early onset of a progressive disease or the occurrence of a more established problem. Modern neuroscience research suggests that naming relies on specific and distributed networks that operate in concert to support various processing stages, spanning from object recognition to spoken words. Likewise, studies evaluating the types of naming impairments in patients with neurologic conditions have contributed to the understanding of acquired forms of naming impairments and the underlying stages during normal language processing. In this article, we review the neurobiological mechanisms supporting naming, with a focus on the clinical application of these concepts. We provide an overview of the stages of cognitive processing that are hypothesized to support naming. For each stage, we explore the evidence revealing its neural basis, drawing parallels to clinical syndromes that commonly disrupt each stage. We review the patterns of naming impairment across various neurologic conditions, including classic language disorders, such as poststroke aphasia or primary progressive aphasia, as well as other diseases where language impairments may be subtle but helpful for the appropriate diagnosis. In this context, we provide a structured and practical guide for the bedside naming assessments rooted in modern neuroscience, aimed at supporting the evaluation and diagnosis of neurologic conditions that affect language."
38299747,Screen time and pediatric headache: A scoping review of the literature,"Langdon RL, DiSabella MT, Strelzik JA.",Headache. 2024 Feb;64(2):211-225. doi: 10.1111/head.14674. Epub 2024 Feb 1.,Langdon RL,Headache,2024,2024/02/01,,,10.1111/head.14674,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence regarding screen use as a contributing factor in pediatric headache and migraine.
BACKGROUND: Screen exposure is often reported as a headache trigger, though there is no current consensus in terms of how screen type, duration, or frequency influences pediatric headache and the associated burden of disease.
METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Health and Medical Database, and Google Scholar was performed through November 2022 in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. All English-language articles of pediatric patients aged ≤18 years evaluating screen use in relation to headache were included.
RESULTS: A total of 48 studies were included. Nearly all studies were cross-sectional and represented international samples. The strongest association between screen use and headache found was for duration of use, and computer use emerged as the most common device type related to headache. While there were mixed findings related to screen use and specific headache diagnosis, migraine appeared to confer a higher risk. Across studies, there were insufficient data to assess the impact of screen use on headache frequency or headache-related disability. Several studies demonstrated changes in screen use and headache patterns related to the COVID-19 pandemic and computer vision syndrome was commonly reported.
CONCLUSIONS: While there is preliminary evidence supporting possible associations between screen use and pediatric headache, there are several limitations in the present review including a lack of prospective and randomized controlled trials to better demonstrate causal relationships as well as methodological limitations with significant variability in how both headache and screen use are defined and measured. Future studies including real-time screen use and device monitoring are needed to better understand the influence of screen use behaviors on pediatric headache and to help further define best-use guidelines around these technologies."

Several magnetic resonance imaging markers have therefore emerged, providing new information on the diagnosis, progression, and mechanisms of small vessel disease. Yet, the reproducibility of these small vessel disease markers has received little attention despite being widely used in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. This review focuses on the main small vessel disease-related markers on magnetic resonance imaging including: white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, dilated perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain volume. The aim is to summarize, for each marker, what is currently known about: (1) its reproducibility in studies with a scan-rescan procedure either in single or multicenter settings; (2) the acquisition-related sources of variability; and, (3) the techniques used to minimize this variability. Based on the results, we discuss technical and other challenges that need to be overcome in order for these markers to be reliably used as outcome measures in future clinical trials. We also highlight the key points that need to be considered when designing multicenter magnetic resonance imaging studies of small vessel disease."

Epub 2020 Feb 21.,Raffort J,J Vasc Surg,2020,2020/02/26,,,10.1016/j.jvs.2019.12.026,"OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease, and the only curative treatment relies on open or endovascular repair. The decision to treat relies on the evaluation of the risk of AAA growth and rupture, which can be difficult to assess in practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed new insights into the management of cardiovascular diseases, but its application in AAA has so far been poorly described. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge on the potential applications of AI in patients with AAA.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed. The MEDLINE database was searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search strategy used a combination of keywords and included studies using AI in patients with AAA published between May 2019 and January 2000. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and performed data extraction. The search of published literature identified 34 studies with distinct methodologies, aims, and study designs.
RESULTS: AI was used in patients with AAA to improve image segmentation and for quantitative analysis and characterization of AAA morphology, geometry, and fluid dynamics. AI allowed computation of large data sets to identify patterns that may be predictive of AAA growth and rupture. Several predictive and prognostic programs were also developed to assess patients' postoperative outcomes, including mortality and complications after endovascular aneurysm repair.
CONCLUSIONS: AI represents a useful tool in the interpretation and analysis of AAA imaging by enabling automatic quantitative measurements and morphologic characterization. It could be used to help surgeons in preoperative planning. AI-driven data management may lead to the development of computational programs for the prediction of AAA evolution and risk of rupture as well as postoperative outcomes. AI could also be used to better evaluate the indications and types of surgical treatment and to plan the postoperative follow-up. AI represents an attractive tool for decision-making and may facilitate development of personalized therapeutic approaches for patients with AAA."

This dissemination can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with COVID-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is known as one of the primary diagnostic tools. However, RT-PCR tests are costly and time-consuming; it also requires specific materials, equipment, and instruments. Moreover, most countries are suffering from a lack of testing kits because of limitations on budget and techniques. Thus, this standard method is not suitable to meet the requirements of fast detection and tracking during the COVID-19 pandemic, which motived to employ deep learning (DL)/convolutional neural networks (CNNs) technology with X-ray and CT scans for efficient analysis and diagnostic. This study provides insight about the literature that discussed the deep learning technology and its various techniques that are recently developed to combat the dissemination of COVID-19 disease."

We discussed several computational strategies from pre- to postprocessing image operations, descriptors, and popular classifiers to diagnose a suspected skin lesion based on its virtual similarity to the malignant lesion with known histopathology. We reviewed the current state of smart phone-based apps as diagnostic tools for screening.
METHODS: A literature survey was conducted using a combination of keywords in the bibliographic databases: PubMed, AJCC, PH2, EDRA, and ISIC melanoma project. A number of melanoma detection apps were downloaded for two major mobile operating systems, iOS and Android; their important uses, key challenges, and various expert opinions were evaluated and also discussed.
RESULTS: We have provided an overview of research on the computer-aided diagnosis methods to estimate melanoma risk and early screening. Dermoscopic images are the most viable option for the advent of new image processing technologies based on which many of the skin cancer detection apps are being developed recently. We have categorized and explored their potential uses, evaluation criteria, limitations, and other details.
CONCLUSION: Such advancements are helpful in the sense they are raising awareness. Diagnostic accuracy is the major issue of smart phone-based apps and it cannot replace an adequate clinical experience and biopsy procedures."

Without a high-level mental representation of the kinds of knowledge in a BK knowledgebase, effective or innovative use of the knowledge may be limited. We describe summarization and visualization techniques that capture the big picture of a BK knowledgebase, possibly created from Big Data. In this research, we distinguish between assertion BK and rule-based BK (rule BK) and demonstrate the usefulness of summarization and visualization techniques of assertion BK for clinical phenotyping. As an example, we illustrate how a summary of many intracranial bleeding concepts can improve phenotyping, compared to the traditional approach. We also demonstrate the usefulness of summarization and visualization techniques of rule BK for drug-drug interaction discovery."

Knee articular cartilage segmentation on magnetic resonance (MR) images is of great importance in early diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). Besides, segmentation allows estimating the articular cartilage loss rate which is utilised in clinical practice for assessing the disease progression and morphological changes. It has been traditionally applied in quantifying longitudinal knee OA progression pattern to detect and assess the articular cartilage thickness and volume. Topics covered include various image processing algorithms and major features of different segmentation techniques, feature computations and the performance evaluation metrics. This paper is intended to provide researchers with a broad overview of the currently existing methods in the field, as well as to highlight the shortcomings and potential considerations in the application at clinical practice. The survey showed that state-of-the-art techniques based on DL outperform the other segmentation methods. The analysis of the existing methods reveals that integration of DL-based algorithms with other traditional model-based approaches has achieved the best results (mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between 85.8% and 90%)."

This is especially true for the domain of medical imaging, in which the incorporation of AI aids several imaging-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and registration. Moreover, AI reshapes medical research and contributes to the development of personalized clinical care. Consequently, alongside its extended implementation arises the need for an extensive understanding of AI systems and their inner workings, potentials, and limitations which the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at. Because medical imaging is mainly associated with visual tasks, most explainability approaches incorporate saliency-based XAI methods. In contrast to that, in this article we would like to investigate the full potential of XAI methods in the field of medical imaging by specifically focusing on XAI techniques not relying on saliency, and providing diversified examples.

Moreover, this work aims at establishing a common ground for cross-disciplinary understanding and exchange across disciplines between Deep Learning (DL) builders and healthcare professionals, which is why we aimed for a non-technical overview. Presented XAI methods are divided by a method's output representation into the following categories: Case-based explanations, textual explanations, and auxiliary explanations."

The model application was first conducted by deploying the model externally in real time on three different generations of mosquitoes, and the accuracy was compared with human expert performance. Our results showed that both the learning rate and epochs significantly affected the accuracy, and the best-performing hyperparameters achieved an accuracy of more than 98% at classifying mosquitoes, which showed no significant difference from human-level performance. We demonstrated the feasibility of the method to construct a model with the DCNN when deployed externally on mosquitoes in real time."

Analysis of ophthalmological and musculoskeletal changes secondary to the use of electronic devices with digital screen, such as smartphones, laptops, computers or tablets. Material and Methods. This paper represents is a prospective observational study of 35 participants with ages between 6 and 17. The ophthalmological exam was carried out for all participants in the Ophthalmological Clinic of ""Sf. Spiridon"" Emergency Hospital, Iaşi, and the exam of musculoskeletal disorders took place at ""Sf. Maria"" Pediatrics Hospital, Iaşi. A questionnaire including 14 questions was also distributed for the symptoms caused by the use of digital screen electronic devices. Results. The mean age of participants was 11,29 ± 3,54 years, predominantly female children (62,9%). Convergence insufficiency has been identified in all patients with accommodative disorders and in 18.2% of the children with amblyopia (p = 0.001). The frequency of cases with dry eye syndrome (DES) was 9.1% in the patients with accommodative disorders and 18.2% in the patients with amblyopia. In the entire studied group of patients, the smartphone was the most frequently used electronic device, being found in 77.1% of the cases. As for the gender, about 54% of the boys spent more than 5 hours on electronic devices, while 54.5% of the girls spent between 3 to 5 hours. Among the symptoms that occur during the use of gadgets, pain in the neck, shoulders and back was found most often, being identified in 29 participants. Conclusion. Pre-existent ophthalmological symptoms can be exacerbated by prolonged use of digital screen electronic devices. Musculoskeletal symptoms were encountered in high numbers in all participants, which suggests that musculoskeletal changes must be treated with great importance in Computer Vision Syndrome. Also, the symptomatology determined by the use of gadgets was more frequently associated with males than females.

AIMS: To reflect on the evolving roles of laboratory-based testing for non-malarial febrile illnesses (NMFIs) in low-resource settings, and to consider how advances in diagnostics, in connectivity and transport, and in implementation of quality systems may substantially enhance the capacity of reference laboratories to bridge the current gap between remote passive surveillance and clinically meaningful integrated fever diagnosis.
SOURCES: Iterative search of PubMed databases, organizational reports, and expert consultation.
CONTENT: Implementation of new technologies-such as very broad molecular panels for surveillance and mass spectrometry-may considerably diminish capability gaps in reference laboratories in low-resource settings. Although the need for clinical bacteriology diagnostics is now recognized, the lack of new simple and rapid phenotypic tests for antimicrobial resistance remains a key deficiency. Several initiatives to strengthen diagnostic preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks have highlighted the need for functional tiered laboratory networks. Recently, dramatic headway in connectivity-such as combining automated readers with the image processing and data transmission capabilities of smartphones-now allows for more complex testing and interfacing with distant laboratory information systems while reducing workload and errors. Together with connectivity to transmit and receive results, new approaches to specimen collection and transport-such as the validation of rectal swabs and the use of aerial drones to transport specimens to distant laboratories-now make remote testing feasible. The above innovations also open up the possibility of implementing quality systems through community-level diagnostic stewardship. Finally, strengthened laboratory networks actively support the feasibility of implementing quality-assured point-of-care testing where it is needed.
IMPLICATIONS: Recent advances offer the present-day possibility of innovations to re-invent the relationship between distant reference laboratories and end-users for integrated diagnosis of NMFIs."

METHODS: Cross-sectional study. The study included 426 civil-service office workers, of whom 22% were contact lens wearers. Workers completed the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q) and provided information on their contact lenses and exposure to video display terminals (VDT) at work. CVS was defined as a CVS-Q score of 6 or more. The covariates were age and sex. Logistic regression was used to calculate the association (crude and adjusted for age and sex) between CVS and individual and work-related factors, and between CVS and contact lens type.
RESULTS: Contact lens wearers are more likely to suffer CVS than non-lens wearers, with a prevalence of 65% vs 50%. Workers who wear contact lenses and are exposed to the computer for more than 6 h day(-1) are more likely to suffer CVS than non-lens wearers working at the computer for the same amount of time (aOR = 4.85; 95% CI, 1.25-18.80; p = 0.02).

This proof of concept was obtained with invasive angiographic studies but these are, for obvious reasons, impractical for sequential investigations. Non-invasive imaging has henceforth replaced the more cumbersome invasive studies and has proven extremely valuable in numerous occasions. Because of excellent reproducibility and no radiation exposure, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the non-invasive method of choice to assess the efficacy of anti-atherosclerotic drugs. The high accuracy of this technology is particularly helpful in rare diseases where the small number of affected patients makes the conduct of outcome-trials in large cohorts impractical. With MRI it is possible to assess the extent, as well as the composition, of atherosclerotic plaques and this further enhances the utility of this technology."

Eye-care professionals should educate patients about limiting screen time and managing digital eye strain symptoms.
BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain.
METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain.
RESULTS: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean ± SD: 33 ± 12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew. Digital eye strain incidence was 78% during the curfew. Chi-squared analysis indicated most symptoms are associated with usage duration and employment status. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between digital eye strain and the following factors: using more than one device (odds ratio 1.208, 95% confidence interval: 1.068-1.3661), age, optical correction, employment status, gender, using rewetting drops, and usage duration.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population, prolonged use of digital devices significantly increased during home-isolation. Digital eye strain incidence increased during curfew. Regular eye exams should be encouraged to ensure the use of optimum prescription use and meet the specific visual demands required for the use of digital devices. Eye-health strategies and awareness campaigns should be employed on the importance of regular eye exams, decreasing screen time, practising the 20-20-20 rule, and the use of rewetting drops to help reduce the symptoms of digital eye strain during this period."

Epub 2016 Apr 12.,Keeble C,Br J Radiol,2016,2016/03/16,PMC5257322,,10.1259/bjr.20160094,"The assessment of image quality in medical imaging often requires observers to rate images for some metric or detectability task. These subjective results are used in optimization, radiation dose reduction or system comparison studies and may be compared to objective measures from a computer vision algorithm performing the same task. One popular scoring approach is to use a Likert scale, then assign consecutive numbers to the categories. The mean of these response values is then taken and used for comparison with the objective or second subjective response. Agreement is often assessed using correlation coefficients. We highlight a number of weaknesses in this common approach, including inappropriate analyses of ordinal data and the inability to properly account for correlations caused by repeated images or observers. We suggest alternative data collection and analysis techniques such as amendments to the scale and multilevel proportional odds models. We detail the suitability of each approach depending upon the data structure and demonstrate each method using a medical imaging example. Whilst others have raised some of these issues, we evaluated the entire study from data collection to analysis, suggested sources for software and further reading, and provided a checklist plus flowchart for use with any ordinal data. We hope that raised awareness of the limitations of the current approaches will encourage greater method consideration and the utilization of a more appropriate analysis. More accurate comparisons between measures in medical imaging will lead to a more robust contribution to the imaging literature and ultimately improved patient care."

However, the potential of AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia in assessing patients with COVID-19 has not yet been fully explored. This study aimed to investigate the potential of AI-based CT quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia to predict the critical outcomes and clinical characteristics of patients with residual lung lesions.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1,200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from four hospitals. The incidence of critical outcomes (requiring the support of high-flow oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation or death) and complications during hospitalization (bacterial infection, renal failure, heart failure, thromboembolism, and liver dysfunction) was compared between the groups of pneumonia with high/low-percentage lung lesions, based on AI-based CT quantification. Additionally, 198 patients underwent CT scans 3 months after admission to analyze prognostic factors for residual lung lesions.
RESULTS: The pneumonia group with a high percentage of lung lesions (N = 400) had a higher incidence of critical outcomes and complications during hospitalization than the low percentage group (N = 800). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia was independently associated with critical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.59-19.7), as well as with oxygen requirement (aOR 6.35, 95% CI 4.60-8.76), IMV requirement (aOR 7.73, 95% CI 2.52-23.7), and mortality rate (aOR 6.46, 95% CI 1.87-22.3). Among patients with follow-up CT scans (N = 198), the multivariable analysis revealed that the pneumonia group with a high percentage of lung lesions on admission (aOR 4.74, 95% CI 2.36-9.52), older age (aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.16-5.51), female sex (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.13-5.11), and medical history of hypertension (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.09-4.50) independently predicted persistent residual lung lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: AI-based CT quantification of pneumonia provides valuable information beyond qualitative evaluation by physicians, enabling the prediction of critical outcomes and residual lung lesions in patients with COVID-19."

Currently, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard diagnostic method for determining COVID-19 infection. Various failures in the detection of the disease by means of laboratory samples have raised certain doubts about the characterisation of the infection and the spread of contacts. In clinical practice, chest radiography (RT) and chest computed tomography (CT) are extremely helpful and have been widely used in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. RT is the most common and widely available diagnostic imaging technique, however, its reading by less qualified personnel, in many cases with work overload, causes a high number of errors to be committed. Chest CT can be used for triage, diagnosis, assessment of severity, progression, and response to treatment. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown promise in image classification, showing that they can reduce diagnostic errors by at least matching the diagnostic performance of radiologists. This review shows how AI applied to thoracic radiology speeds up and improves diagnosis, allowing to optimise the workflow of radiologists. It can provide an objective evaluation and achieve a reduction in subjectivity and variability. AI can also help to optimise the resources and increase the efficiency in the management of COVID-19 infection."

Currently, x-ray mammogram is the only modality for mass screening of asymptomatic women. However, it has decreased sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts, which is also associated with a higher risk for breast cancer. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging modality that enables deep tissue imaging of optical contrast at ultrasonically defined spatial resolution, which is much higher than that can be achieved in purely optical imaging modalities. Because of high optical absorption from hemoglobin molecules, PA imaging can map out hemo distribution and dynamics in breast tissue and identify malignant lesions based on tumor associated angiogenesis and hypoxia. We review various PA breast imaging systems proposed over the past few years and summarize the PA features of breast cancer identified in these systems."

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the statements of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols and considering 10 databases, including the gray literature. Protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018089945). The population, intervention, comparison and outcome strategy was used to define the eligibility criteria and only diagnostic test studies were included. Their risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tool. Random-effects model meta-analysis was performed and heterogeneity among the included studies was estimated using the I2 statistic. The grade of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) tool assessed the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation across included studies.
RESULTS: Out of 715 identified citations, four papers, published between 2009 and 2017, fulfilled the criteria and were included in this systematic review. A total of 191 lesions, classified as periapical granuloma and cyst, dentigerous cyst or keratocystic odontogenic tumor, were analyzed. All selected articles scored low risk of bias. The pooled accuracy estimation, regardless of the classification method used, was 88.75% (95% CI = 85.19-92.30). Heterogeneity test reached moderate values (I2 = 57.89%). According to the GRADE tool, the analyzed outcome was classified as having low level of certainty.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall evaluation showed all studies presented high accuracy rates of computer-aided diagnosis systems in classifying radiolucent maxillofacial lesions compared to histopathological biopsy. However, due to the moderate heterogeneity found among the studies included in this meta-analysis, a pragmatic recommendation about the use of computer-assisted analysis is not possible."

OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to assess the impact of residual TR severity post-TTV repair on survival.
METHODS: We evaluated the survival rate at 2 years of 613 patients with severe isolated functional TR who underwent TTV repair in TRIGISTRY according to the severity of residual TR at discharge using a 3-grade (mild, moderate, and severe) or 4-grade scheme (mild, mild to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe).
RESULTS: Residual TR was none/mild in 33%, moderate in 52%, and severe in 15%. The 2-year adjusted survival rates significantly differed between the 3 groups (85%, 70%, and 44%, respectively; restricted mean survival time [RMST]: P = 0.0001). When the 319 patients with moderate residual TR were subdivided into mild to moderate (n = 201, 33%) and moderate to severe (n = 118, 19%), the adjusted survival rate was also significantly different between groups (85%, 80%, 55%, and 44%, respectively; RMST: P = 0.001). Survival was significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe residual TR compared to patients with mild to moderate residual TR (P = 0.006). No difference in survival rates was observed between patients with no/mild and mild to moderate residual TR (P = 0.67) or between patients with moderate to severe and severe residual TR (P = 0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: The moderate residual TR group was heterogeneous and encompassed patients with markedly different clinical outcomes. Refining TR grade classification with a more granular 4-grade scheme improved outcome prediction. Our results highlight the importance of achieving a mild to moderate or lower residual TR grade during TTV repair, which could define a successful intervention."

In case of clinical scans, with lower resolution and sometimes substantial motion artifacts, registration can produce poor results. Visual assessment of registration quality in large clinical datasets is inefficient. In this work, we propose to automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in clinical FLAIR MRI scans of the brain. The method consists of automatically segmenting the ventricles of a given scan using a neural network, and comparing the segmentation to the atlas ventricles propagated to image space. We used the proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas by computing multiple registrations - one directly to the general atlas and others via different age-specific atlases - and then selecting the registration that yielded the highest ventricle overlap. Finally, as an example application of the complete pipeline, a voxelwise map of white matter hyperintensity burden was computed using only the scans with registration quality above a predefined threshold. Methods were evaluated in a single-site dataset of more than 1000 scans, as well as a multi-center dataset comprising 142 clinical scans from 12 sites. The automated ventricle segmentation reached a Dice coefficient with manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset, and 0.83 in the multi-center dataset. Registration via age-specific atlases could improve ventricle overlap compared to a direct registration to the general atlas (Dice similarity coefficient increase up to 0.15). Experiments also showed that selecting scans with the registration quality assessment method could improve the quality of average maps of white matter hyperintensity burden, instead of using all scans for the computation of the white matter hyperintensity map. In this work, we demonstrated the utility of an automated tool for assessing image registration quality in clinical scans. This image quality assessment step could ultimately assist in the translation of automated neuroimaging pipelines to the clinic."

Models generated from quantitative computed tomography (QCT) incorporate the geometry and spatial distribution of bone mineral density (BMD) to simulate physiological and traumatic loads as well as orthopaedic implant behaviour. The present review discusses the current strengths and weakness of finite element models for application to skeletal biomechanics.
RECENT FINDINGS: In cadaver studies, finite element models provide better estimations of strength compared to BMD. Data from clinical studies are encouraging; however, the superiority of finite element models over BMD measures for fracture prediction has not been shown conclusively, and may be sex and site dependent. Therapeutic effects on bone strength are larger than for BMD; however, model validation has only been performed on untreated bone. High-resolution modalities and novel image processing methods may enhance the structural representation and predictive ability. Despite extensive use of finite element models to study orthopaedic implant stability, accurate simulation of the bone-implant interface and fracture progression remains a significant challenge.
SUMMARY: Skeletal finite element models provide noninvasive assessments of strength and implant stability. Improved structural representation and implant surface interaction may enable more accurate models of fragility in the future."

It offers a standardized measure of segmentation accuracy which has proven useful. However, it offers diminishing insight when the number of objects is unknown, such as in white matter lesion segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We present a refinement for finer grained parsing of SDI results in situations where the number of objects is unknown. We explore these ideas with two case studies showing what can be learned from our two presented studies. Our first study explores an inter-rater comparison, showing that smaller lesions cannot be reliably identified. In our second case study, we demonstrate fusing multiple MS lesion segmentation algorithms based on the insights into the algorithms provided by our analysis to generate a segmentation that exhibits improved performance. This work demonstrates the wealth of information that can be learned from refined analysis of medical image segmentations."

Epub 2019 Mar 13.,Dissanayake B,Skin Res Technol,2019,2019/03/14,,,10.1111/srt.12696,"BACKGROUND: Visible facial pores are an important cosmetic concern especially among young females. Number of different methodologies is used today to assess facial pores and efficacy of technologies. Main limitations of these methods are, however, (a) moderate correlation with visual perception, (b) characterization is mostly limited to size or number of pores, (c) measurement is limited to a smaller area of face, and (d) operational difficulties. In order to address these limitations, we developed a 2D image analysis tool to assess and characterize visible facial pores.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two clinical studies were conducted with northeast Asian skin type females. In the first study, 40 subjects age between 20 and 40 with different degree of pore severity were recruited. In the second study, 15 subjects age between 20 and 40 with enlarged pores were recruited to evaluate pore product efficacy. In both studies, full face images were taken using Visia-CR and assessed by means of the newly developed tool and visual grading.
RESULTS: A high correlation between visual grading and pore size was obtained (r = 0.86). New methodology was able to differentiate products similar to visual grading.
CONCLUSION: Novel pore image analysis method using 2D skin surface imaging with standard photography has been developed and validated. In addition to pore size measurements, we propose this method to be used to measure pore shape, color, and orientation for a comprehensive characterization of facial pores."

In this study, we developed and evaluated a deep learning architecture to generate high-field quality brain images from low-field inputs using a paired dataset of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients scanned at 64mT and 3T.
METHODS: A total of 49 MS patients were scanned on portable 64mT and standard 3T scanners at Penn (n=25) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH, n=24) with T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR acquisitions. Using this paired data, we developed a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture for low- to high-field image translation (LowGAN). We then evaluated synthesized images with respect to image quality, brain morphometry, and white matter lesions.
RESULTS: Synthetic high-field images demonstrated visually superior quality compared to low-field inputs and significantly higher normalized cross-correlation (NCC) to actual high-field images for T1 (p=0.001) and FLAIR (p<0.001) contrasts. LowGAN generally outperformed the current state-of-the-art for low-field volumetrics. For example, thalamic, lateral ventricle, and total cortical volumes in LowGAN outputs did not differ significantly from 3T measurements. Synthetic outputs preserved MS lesions and captured a known inverse relationship between total lesion volume and thalamic volume.
CONCLUSIONS: LowGAN generates synthetic high-field images with comparable visual and quantitative quality to actual high-field scans. Enhancing portable MRI image quality could add value and boost clinician confidence, enabling wider adoption of this technology."

Although the most common forms of HAND are mild and identified through neuropsychological testing, there is evidence that with aging these mild forms become more prevalent and may advance to the most severe form of HAND, HIV-associated dementia. Therefore, novel therapies must be developed that can be used adjunctively with cART to prevent deterioration or restore normal cognitive function. In order to develop innovative treatments, animal models are used for preclinical testing. Ideally, a HAND animal model should portray similar mild cognitive deficits that are found in humans. A mouse model of HAND is discussed, which demonstrates mild behavioral deficits and has been used to investigate cART and novel treatments for HAND. This model also shows correlations between abnormal mouse behavior due to HIV in the brain and pathological parameters such as gliosis and neuronal abnormalities. A recent advancement utilizes the object recognition test to monitor mouse behavior before and after treatment. It is postulated that this model is well suited for preclinical testing of novel therapies and provides correlations of mild cognitive impairment with pathological markers that can give further insight into the pathophysiology of HAND."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint study, between waves 6 and 7 of the national population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC).
SETTING: Assessment centres in seven Australian cities, February 2015-March 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: Of the 1874 participating families, 1288 children (51% girls) and 1264 parents (87% mothers, mean age 43.7) were analysed. Diabetic participants and non-biological pairs were excluded from concordance analyses.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Retinal photographs were taken by non-mydriatic fundus camera. Trained graders scored vascular calibre using semi-automated software, yielding estimates of central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) and arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR). Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models assessed parent-child concordance. Survey weights and methods accounted for LSAC's complex sampling, stratification and clustering within postcodes.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) of CRAE and CRVE were larger in children (159.5 (11.8) and 231.1 (16.5) μm, respectively) than parents (151.5 (14.0) and 220.6 (19.0) μm), yielding similar AVR (children 0.69 (0.05), parents 0.69 (0.06)). Correlation coefficients for parent-child pairs were 0.22 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.27) for CRAE, 0.23 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.28) for CRVE and 0.18 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.24) for AVR. Mother-child and father-child values were similar (0.20 and 0.32 for CRAE, 0.22 and 0.29 for CRVE, respectively). Relationships attenuated slightly on adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes and body mass index. Percentiles and concordance are presented for the whole sample and by sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Arteriolar and venular calibre were similar to previously documented measures in midlife adult and late childhood populations. Population parent-child concordance values align with moderate polygenic heritability reported in smaller studies."

Epub 2024 Aug 3.,Javed N,Acta Trop,2024,2024/08/05,,,10.1016/j.actatropica.2024.107347,"Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, resulting in over 600,000 deaths from malaria and around 36,000 deaths from dengue each year, with millions of people infected annually, leading to substantial economic losses. The existing mosquito control measures, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), helped to reduce the infections. However, mosquito-borne diseases are still among the deadliest diseases, forcing us to improve the existing control methods and look for alternative methods simultaneously. Advanced monitoring techniques, including remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of mosquito control measures. Mosquitoes' behavioural traits, such as locomotion, blood-feeding, and fertility are the key determinants of disease transmission and epidemiology. Technological advancements, such as high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI) driven object detection models, including groundbreaking convolutional neural networks, have provided efficient and precise options to monitor various mosquito behaviours, including locomotion, oviposition, fertility, and host-seeking. However, they are not commonly employed in mosquito-based research. This review highlights the novel and significant advancements in behaviour-monitoring tools, mostly from the last decade, due to cutting-edge video monitoring technology and artificial intelligence. These advancements can offer enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to quickly process large volumes of data, enabling detailed behavioural analysis over extended periods and large sample sizes, unlike traditional manual methods prone to human error and labour-intensive. The use of behaviour-assaying techniques can support or replace existing monitoring techniques and directly contribute to improving control measures by providing more accurate and real-time data on mosquito activity patterns and responses to interventions. This enhanced understanding can help establish the role of behavioural changes in improving epidemiological models, making them more precise and dynamic. As a result, mosquito management strategies can become more adaptive and responsive, leading to more effective and targeted interventions. Ultimately, this will reduce disease transmission and significantly improve public health outcomes."

However, the broader applicability of retinal photograph-based deep learning for predicting other systemic biomarkers and the generalisability of this approach to various populations remains unexplored.
METHODS: With use of 236 257 retinal photographs from seven diverse Asian and European cohorts (two health screening centres in South Korea, the Beijing Eye Study, three cohorts in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study, and the UK Biobank), we evaluated the capacities of 47 deep-learning algorithms to predict 47 systemic biomarkers as outcome variables, including demographic factors (age and sex); body composition measurements; blood pressure; haematological parameters; lipid profiles; biochemical measures; biomarkers related to liver function, thyroid function, kidney function, and inflammation; and diabetes. The standard neural network architecture of VGG16 was adopted for model development.
FINDINGS: In addition to previously reported systemic biomarkers, we showed quantification of body composition indices (muscle mass, height, and bodyweight) and creatinine from retinal photographs. Body muscle mass could be predicted with an R2 of 0·52 (95% CI 0·51-0·53) in the internal test set, and of 0·33 (0·30-0·35) in one external test set with muscle mass measurement available. The R2 value for the prediction of height was 0·42 (0·40-0·43), of bodyweight was 0·36 (0·34-0·37), and of creatinine was 0·38 (0·37-0·40) in the internal test set. However, the performances were poorer in external test sets (with the lowest performance in the European cohort), with R2 values ranging between 0·08 and 0·28 for height, 0·04 and 0·19 for bodyweight, and 0·01 and 0·26 for creatinine. Of the 47 systemic biomarkers, 37 could not be predicted well from retinal photographs via deep learning (R2≤0·14 across all external test sets).
INTERPRETATION: Our work provides new insights into the potential use of retinal photographs to predict systemic biomarkers, including body composition indices and serum creatinine, using deep learning in populations with a similar ethnic background. Further evaluations are warranted to validate these findings and evaluate the clinical utility of these algorithms.

Recent studies indicate that image-based radiomics features from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images have predictive power for NSCLC outcomes. To this end, easily calculated functional features such as the maximum and the mean of standard uptake value (SUV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are most commonly used for NSCLC prognostication, but their prognostic value remains controversial. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are rapidly emerging as a new method for cancer image analysis, with significantly enhanced predictive power compared to hand-crafted radiomics features. Here we show that CNNs trained to perform the tumor segmentation task, with no other information than physician contours, identify a rich set of survival-related image features with remarkable prognostic value. In a retrospective study on pre-treatment PET-CT images of 96 NSCLC patients before stereotactic-body radiotherapy (SBRT), we found that the CNN segmentation algorithm (U-Net) trained for tumor segmentation in PET and CT images, contained features having strong correlation with 2- and 5-year overall and disease-specific survivals. The U-Net algorithm has not seen any other clinical information (e.g. survival, age, smoking history, etc.) than the images and the corresponding tumor contours provided by physicians. In addition, we observed the same trend by validating the U-Net features against an extramural data set provided by Stanford Cancer Institute. Furthermore, through visualization of the U-Net, we also found convincing evidence that the regions of metastasis and recurrence appear to match with the regions where the U-Net features identified patterns that predicted higher likelihoods of death. We anticipate our findings will be a starting point for more sophisticated non-intrusive patient specific cancer prognosis determination. For example, the deep learned PET/CT features can not only predict survival but also visualize high-risk regions within or adjacent to the primary tumor and hence potentially impact therapeutic outcomes by optimal selection of therapeutic strategy or first-line therapy adjustment."

METHODS: In all women between 19 and 30 weeks' gestation with a normal fetal heart, an attempt was made to acquire STIC volume datasets of the apical four-chamber view if the following criteria were met: (1) fetal spine located between 5- and 7-o'clock positions; (2) minimal or absent shadowing (including a clearly visible transverse aortic arch); (3) absence of fetal breathing, hiccups, or movement; and (4) adequate image quality. Each STIC volume successfully acquired was evaluated by STICLoop™ to determine its appropriateness before applying the FINE method. Visualization rates of fetal echocardiography views using diagnostic planes and/or Virtual Intelligent Sonographer Assistance (VIS-Assistance®) were calculated.
RESULTS: One or more STIC volumes (365 in total) were obtained successfully in 72.5% (150/207) of women undergoing ultrasound examination. Of the 365 volumes evaluated by STICLoop, 351 (96.2%) were considered to be appropriate. From the 351 STIC volumes, only one STIC volume per patient (n = 150) was analyzed using the FINE method, and consequently nine fetal echocardiography views were generated in 76-100% of cases using diagnostic planes only, in 98-100% of cases using VIS-Assistance only, and in 98-100% of cases when using a combination of diagnostic planes and/or VIS-Assistance.
CONCLUSIONS: In women between 19 and 30 weeks' gestation with a normal fetal heart undergoing prospective sonographic examination, STIC volumes can be obtained successfully in 72.5% of cases. The FINE method can be applied to generate nine standard fetal echocardiography views in 98-100% of these cases using a combination of diagnostic planes and/or VIS-Assistance. This suggests that FINE could be implemented in fetal cardiac screening programs. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA."

Symptoms include dry eyes, blurred vision, eye strain, headache, and also neck and shoulder pain. This study was carried out to analyze the correlation between the exposure time of High Energy Visible (HEV) from mobile devices' use and the prevalence of evaporative dry eyes in young age.
METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was done using quota sampling method for 100 High School students. Data collection was performed using questionnaire to identify daily use of mobile devices (hours) and duration for using mobile devices (years). A classification was determined as mild, moderate, and heavy HEV exposure. Evaporative dry eyes were diagnosed using tear break-up time test (TBUT) of less than 10 s for both eyes.
RESULTS: Ninety-four students participated in this study. A total of 82 students (87.2%) experienced evaporative dry eyes. There were 11 students (11.7%) who had dry eyes with mild exposure, 18 students (19.1%) had dry eyes with moderate exposure, and 53 students (56.4%) had dry eyes with heavy exposure. A chi square analysis showed all HEV exposures have similar risk to the prevalence of dry eyes among High School students (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing evaporative dry eyes, as one of the symptoms of CVS in young age with normal tear production, could be induced even with minimal exposure to mobile devices."

We evaluated the correlation between digital image analysis (continuous variable data) and pathologist visual scoring (quasi-continuous variable data), reproducibility of each method, and association of digital image analysis methods with outcomes using prostate cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs) stained for estrogen receptor-β2 (ERβ2).
METHODS: Prostate cancer TMAs were digitized and evaluated by pathologist visual scoring versus digital image analysis for ERβ2 staining within tumor epithelium. Two independent analysis runs were performed to evaluate reproducibility. Image analysis data were evaluated for associations with recurrence-free survival and disease specific survival following radical prostatectomy.
RESULTS: We observed weak/moderate Spearman correlation between digital image analysis and pathologist visual scores of tumor nuclei (Analysis Run A: 0.42, Analysis Run B: 0.41), and moderate/strong correlation between digital image analysis and pathologist visual scores of tumor cytoplasm (Analysis Run A: 0.70, Analysis Run B: 0.69). For the reproducibility analysis, there was high Spearman correlation between pathologist visual scores generated for individual TMA spots across Analysis Runs A and B (Nuclei: 0.84, Cytoplasm: 0.83), and very high correlation between digital image analysis for individual TMA spots across Analysis Runs A and B (Nuclei: 0.99, Cytoplasm: 0.99). Further, ERβ2 staining was significantly associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) when quantified by cytoplasmic digital image analysis (HR 2.16, 95 % CI 1.02-4.57, p = 0.045), nuclear image analysis (HR 2.67, 95 % CI 1.20-5.96, p = 0.016), and total malignant epithelial area analysis (HR 5.10, 95 % CI 1.70-15.34, p = 0.004). After adjusting for clinicopathologic factors, only total malignant epithelial area ERβ2 staining was significantly associated with PCSM (HR 4.08, 95 % CI 1.37-12.15, p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Digital methods of immunohistochemical quantification are more reproducible than pathologist visual scoring in prostate cancer, suggesting that digital methods are preferable and especially warranted for studies involving large sample sizes."

The persistence of abnormal spirometry and symptoms after treatment are well described, but the structural abnormalities underlying these changes remain poorly defined, limiting our ability to phenotype post-TB lung disease in to meaningful categories for clinical management, prognostication, and ongoing research. The relationship between post-TB lung damage and patient-centred outcomes including functional impairment, respiratory symptoms, and health related quality of life also remains unclear.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to determine the prevalence and pattern of imaging-defined lung pathology in adults after medical treatment for pleural, miliary, or pulmonary TB disease. Data were collected on study characteristics, and the modality, timing, and findings of thoracic imaging. The proportion of studies relating imaging findings to spirometry results and patient morbidity was recorded. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottowa score. (Prospero Registration number CRD42015027958).
RESULTS: We identified 37 eligible studies. The principle features seen on CXR were cavitation (8.3-83.7%), bronchiectasis (4.3-11.2%), and fibrosis (25.0-70.4%), but prevalence was highly variable. CT imaging identified a wider range of residual abnormalities than CXR, including nodules (25.0-55.8%), consolidation (3.7-19.2%), and emphysema (15.0-45.0%). The prevalence of cavitation was generally lower (7.4-34.6%) and bronchiectasis higher (35.0-86.0%) on CT vs. CXR imaging. A paucity of prospective data, and data from HIV-infected adults and sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) was noted. Few studies related structural damage to physiological impairment, respiratory symptoms, or patient morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-TB structural lung pathology is common. Prospective data are required to determine the evolution of this lung damage and its associated morbidity over time. Further data are required from HIV-infected groups and those living in sSA."

The differences in myocardial perfusion have been purported to explain this discrepancy. The exact prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in Eisenmenger syndrome is not known. We sought to examine the prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 20 consecutive adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome were subjected to clinical assessment, six-minute walk test and echocardiography. Myocardial perfusion was assessed using one day stress-rest Gated Technetium-99 m Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography.
RESULTS: Nineteen (95%) patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. All patients had RV hypertrophy. Five (25%) patients had RV systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular systolic function was normal in all except in three patients. Two (10%) patients had perfusion defects in the RV and 4 (20%) patients had perfusion defects in the left ventricle (LV).
CONCLUSION: Myocardial perfusion defects, both in RV and LV, occur even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with Eisenmenger syndrome."

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the measurement of retinal properties in dementia using fundus imaging.
RESULTS: Ten studies assessing retinal properties in dementia were included. Quantitative measurement revealed significant yet inconsistent pathologic changes in vessel caliber, tortuosity, and fractal dimension. Retinopathy was more prevalent in dementia. No association of age-related macular degeneration with dementia was reported.
DISCUSSION: Inconsistent findings across studies provide tentative support for the application of fundus camera imaging as a means of identifying changes associated with dementia. The potential of fundus image analysis in differentiating between dementia subtypes should be investigated using larger well-characterized samples. Future work should focus on refining and standardizing methods and measurements."

Deep learning involves learning without being explicitly told what to focus on and utilizes several layers of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to create a robust algorithm that is capable of high-complexity tasks. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a subset of ANNs that are particularly useful for image processing as well as cognitive tasks. Training of these algorithms involves inputting raw human-labeled data, which are then processed through the algorithm's multiple layers and allow CNN to develop their own learning of image features. AI systems must be validated using different population datasets since the performance of the AI system would vary according to the population. Indian datasets have been used in AI-based risk model that could predict whether an infant would develop treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). AI also served as an epidemiological tool by objectively showing that a higher ROP severity was in Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) that did not have the resources to monitor and titrate oxygen. There are rising concerns about the medicolegal aspect of AI implementation as well as discussion on the possibilities of catastrophic life-threatening diseases like retinoblastoma and lipemia retinalis being missed by AI. Computer-based systems have the advantage over humans in not being susceptible to biases or fatigue. This is especially relevant in a country like India with an increased rate of ROP and a preexisting strained doctor-to-preterm child ratio. Many AI algorithms can perform in a way comparable to or exceeding human experts, and this opens possibilities for future large-scale prospective studies."

However, most of the models used to classify chest radiographs are derived from openly available deep neural networks, trained on large image datasets. These datasets differ from chest radiographs in that they are mostly color images and have substantially more labels. Therefore, very deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) designed for ImageNet and often representing more complex relationships, might not be required for the comparably simpler task of classifying medical image data. Sixteen different architectures of CNN were compared regarding the classification performance on two openly available datasets, the CheXpert and COVID-19 Image Data Collection. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC) between 0.83 and 0.89 could be achieved on the CheXpert dataset. On the COVID-19 Image Data Collection, all models showed an excellent ability to detect COVID-19 and non-COVID pneumonia with AUROC values between 0.983 and 0.998. It could be observed, that more shallow networks may achieve results comparable to their deeper and more complex counterparts with shorter training times, enabling classification performances on medical image data close to the state-of-the-art methods even when using limited hardware."

Smoking is also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affects brain processing, and is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Tobacco toxins (e.g., nicotine at high levels) inhaled in smoke may cause disorders resulting in preclinical brain changes. Researchers suggest that there are differences in brain volume between smokers and non-smokers. This review examines these differences in brain grey matter volume (GMV). In March/April 2015, MedLine, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched using the terms: ""grey matter"" AND ""voxel-based"" AND ""smoking"" AND ""cigarette"". The 4 studies analyzed found brain GMV decreases in smokers compared to non-smokers. Furthermore, sex-specific differences were found; while the thalamus and cerebellum were affected in both sexes, decreased GMV in the olfactory gyrus was found only in male smokers. Age-group differences were also found, and these may suggest pre-existing abnormalities that lead to nicotine dependence in younger individuals. Only 1 study found a positive correlation between number of pack-years smoked and GMV. Smoking decreases GMV in most brain areas. This decrease may be responsible for the cognitive impairment and difficulties with emotional regulation found in smokers compared with non-smokers."

Methods: This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 389 male Lebanese students (aged 13-17 years) between October and December 2019. Results: After adjusting for the covariates (age, body mass index, and House Crowding Index), those with CVS had significantly higher mean depression (P &lt; .001), anxiety (P = .003), and insomnia (P = .007) scores compared to those without CVS. The presence of CVS was associated with significantly higher depression (B = 3.25), anxiety (B = 4.11), and insomnia (B = 4.49), but not aggression.

29360944,Migraine with visual aura associated with thicker visual cortex,"Gaist D, Hougaard A, Garde E, Reislev NL, Wiwie R, Iversen P, Madsen CG, Blaabjerg M, Nielsen HH, Krøigård T, Østergaard K, Kyvik KO, Hjelmborg J, Madsen K, Siebner HR, Ashina M.",Brain. 2018 Mar 1;141(3):776-785. doi: 10.1093/brain/awx382.,Gaist D,Brain,2018,2018/01/24,,,10.1093/brain/awx382,"Until recent years it was believed that migraine with aura was a disorder causing intermittent neurological symptoms, with no impact on brain structure. However, recent MRI studies have reported increased cortical thickness of visual and somatosensory areas in patients with migraine with aura, suggesting that such structural alterations were either due to increased neuronal density in the areas involved, or a result of multiple episodes of cortical spreading depression as part of aura attacks. Subsequent studies have yielded conflicting results, possibly due to methodological reasons, e.g. small number of subjects. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited females aged 30-60 years from the nationwide Danish Twin Registry. Brain MRI of females with migraine with aura (patients), their co-twins, and unrelated migraine-free twins (controls) were performed at a single centre and assessed for cortical thickness in predefined cortical areas (V1, V2, V3A, MT, somatosensory cortex), blinded to headache diagnoses. The difference in cortical thickness between patients and controls adjusted for age, and other potential confounders was assessed. Comparisons of twin pairs discordant for migraine with aura were also performed. Comparisons were based on 166 patients, 30 co-twins, and 137 controls. Compared with controls, patients had a thicker cortex in areas V2 [adjusted mean difference 0.032 mm (95% confidence interval 0.003 to 0.061), V3A [adjusted mean difference 0.037 mm (95% confidence interval 0.008 to 0.067)], while differences in the remaining areas examined were not statistically significant [adjusted mean difference (95% confidence interval): V1 0.022 (-0.007 to 0.052); MT: 0.018 (-0.011 to 0.047); somatosensory cortex: 0.020 (-0.009 to 0.049)]. We found no association between the regions of interest and active migraine, or number of lifetime aura attacks. Migraine with aura discordant twin pairs (n = 30) only differed in mean thickness of V2 (0.039 mm, 95% CI 0.005 to 0.074). In conclusion, females with migraine with aura have a thicker cortex corresponding to visual areas and our results indicate this may be an inherent trait rather than a result of repeated aura attacks."

A single-center, phase II, observational, case-control, 1-month study in VDT workers without dry eye disease was carried out. Demographics and number of actual hours at VDT/day were taken into account. All subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including assessment of contrast sensitivity, and completed the computer vision symptom scale questionnaire at baseline and one month later. A total of 30 Caucasian subjects adhered to the required inclusion criteria and completed the study; 15 subjects were treated (T) and 15 were controls (C). All clinical data at baseline were similar in both groups (p &gt; 0.05): after one month, all subjects had stable visual acuity, refractive defect and intraocular pressure (IOP); screen exposure time was unchanged. Regarding symptoms, at randomization, the groups had a similar score: 33.1 ± 3.3 in T and 32.8 ± 5.6 in C. One month later, the computer vision symptom scale (CVSS) questionnaire score decreased by -14.1 ± 3, 1 (p = 0.000) and -2.3 ± 1.8 (p = 0.568), respectively. Regarding contrast sensitivity, in group C the values of spatial frequencies remained unchanged, while they improved in almost all the cycles per degree stimuli in the treated group. Oral intake of a fixed combination of zinc, L-carnitine, elderberry extract, black currant and eleutherococcus extract can significantly improve contrast sensitivity and symptoms in VDT workers with no signs of dry eye disease."

Increasing evidence suggests variation in retinal vascular traits is highly heritable. This study aimed to identify the genetic determinants of retinal vascular traits. Approach and Results: We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for quantitative retinal vascular traits derived using semi-automatic image analysis of digital retinal photographs from the GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside; N=1736) and ORCADES (Orkney Complex Disease Study; N=1358) cohorts. We identified a novel genome-wide significant locus at 19q13 (ACTN4/CAPN12) for retinal venular tortuosity (TortV), and one at 13q34 (COL4A2) for retinal arteriolar tortuosity (TortA); these 2 loci were subsequently confirmed in 3 independent cohorts (N<sub>total</sub>=1413). In the combined analysis of discovery and replication cohorts, the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism in ACTN4/CAPN12 was rs1808382 (β<sub>s.d.</sub>=-0.109; SE=0.015; P=2.39×10-13) and in COL4A2 was rs7991229 (β<sub>s.d.</sub>=0.103; SE=0.015; P=4.66×10-12). Notably, the ACTN4/CAPN12 locus associated with TortV is also associated with coronary artery disease, heart rate, and atrial fibrillation.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic determinants of retinal vascular tortuosity are also linked to cardiovascular health. These findings provide a molecular pathophysiological foundation for the use of retinal vascular traits as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases."

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included patients who underwent a successful external dacryocystorhinostomy or NEN-DCR and had ≥1 month follow up. Pictures of the ostium were captured with a nasal endoscope (4 mm, 30°) after inserting a lacrimal probe premarked at 2 mm. Image analyses were performed using Image J and Contour softwares.
RESULTS: Of the 113 patients included, external dacryocystorhinostomy group had 53 patients and NEN-DCR group had 60 patients. The mean age of patients in the NEN-DCR group (38 years) was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the external dacryocystorhinostomy group (50 years). There was no statistically significant difference (2 sample t test, p > 0.05) in mean follow up (6 vs. 4 months), maximum diameter of ostium (8 vs. 7 mm), perpendicular drawn to it (4 vs. 4 mm), area of ostium (43 vs. 36 mm), and the minimum distance between common internal punctum and edge of the ostium (1 vs. 1 mm) between the external and NEN-DCR groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Image processing softwares offer simple and objective method to measure the ostium. While ostia are comparable in size, their relative position differs with posteriorly placed ostia in external compared with inferior in NEN-DCR."

Epub 2019 Jun 8.,Shawky MS,Breast Cancer Res Treat,2019,2019/06/10,,,10.1007/s10549-019-05300-1,"PURPOSE: It is well established that high mammographic density (MD), when adjusted for age and body mass index, is one of the strongest known risk factors for breast cancer (BC), and also associates with higher incidence of interval cancers in screening due to the masking of early mammographic abnormalities. Increasing research is being undertaken to determine the underlying histological and biochemical determinants of MD and their consequences for BC pathogenesis, anticipating that improved mechanistic insights may lead to novel preventative or treatment interventions. At the same time, technological advances in digital and contrast mammography are such that the validity of well-established relationships needs to be re-examined in this context.
METHODS: With attention to old versus new technologies, we conducted a literature review to summarise the relationships between clinicopathologic features of BC and the density of the surrounding breast tissue on mammography, including the associations with BC biological features inclusive of subtype, and implications for the clinical disease course encompassing relapse, progression, treatment response and survival.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is reasonable evidence to support positive relationships between high MD (HMD) and tumour size, lymph node positivity and local relapse in the absence of radiotherapy, but not between HMD and LVI, regional relapse or distant metastasis. Conflicting data exist for associations of HMD with tumour location, grade, intrinsic subtype, receptor status, second primary incidence and survival, which need further confirmatory studies. We did not identify any relationships that did not hold up when data involving newer imaging techniques were employed in analysis."

DESIGN: A deep learning model was developed to detect the presence of GA in color fundus photographs, and 2 additional models were developed to detect CGA in different scenarios.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 59 812 color fundus photographs from longitudinal follow-up of 4582 participants in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) dataset. Gold standard labels were from human expert reading center graders using a standardized protocol.
METHODS: A deep learning model was trained to use color fundus photographs to predict GA presence from a population of eyes with no AMD to advanced AMD. A second model was trained to predict CGA presence from the same population. A third model was trained to predict CGA presence from the subset of eyes with GA. For training and testing, 5-fold cross-validation was used. For comparison with human clinician performance, model performance was compared with that of 88 retinal specialists.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
RESULTS: The deep learning models (GA detection, CGA detection from all eyes, and centrality detection from GA eyes) had AUCs of 0.933-0.976, 0.939-0.976, and 0.827-0.888, respectively. The GA detection model had accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 0.965 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.959-0.971), 0.692 (0.560-0.825), 0.978 (0.970-0.985), and 0.584 (0.491-0.676), respectively, compared with 0.975 (0.971-0.980), 0.588 (0.468-0.707), 0.982 (0.978-0.985), and 0.368 (0.230-0.505) for the retinal specialists. The CGA detection model had values of 0.966 (0.957-0.975), 0.763 (0.641-0.885), 0.971 (0.960-0.982), and 0.394 (0.341-0.448). The centrality detection model had values of 0.762 (0.725-0.799), 0.782 (0.618-0.945), 0.729 (0.543-0.916), and 0.799 (0.710-0.888).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model demonstrated high accuracy for the automated detection of GA. The AUC was noninferior to that of human retinal specialists. Deep learning approaches may also be applied to the identification of CGA. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/DeepSeeNet."

The current heavy workload of pathologists in clinics/hospitals may easily lead to unconscious misdiagnosis of CRC based on daily image analyses.
METHODS: Based on a state-of-the-art transfer-learned deep convolutional neural network in artificial intelligence (AI), we proposed a novel patch aggregation strategy for clinic CRC diagnosis using weakly labeled pathological whole-slide image (WSI) patches. This approach was trained and validated using an unprecedented and enormously large number of 170,099 patches, > 14,680 WSIs, from > 9631 subjects that covered diverse and representative clinical cases from multi-independent-sources across China, the USA, and Germany.
RESULTS: Our innovative AI tool consistently and nearly perfectly agreed with (average Kappa statistic 0.896) and even often better than most of the experienced expert pathologists when tested in diagnosing CRC WSIs from multicenters. The average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of AI was greater than that of the pathologists (0.988 vs 0.970) and achieved the best performance among the application of other AI methods to CRC diagnosis. Our AI-generated heatmap highlights the image regions of cancer tissue/cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This first-ever generalizable AI system can handle large amounts of WSIs consistently and robustly without potential bias due to fatigue commonly experienced by clinical pathologists. It will drastically alleviate the heavy clinical burden of daily pathology diagnosis and improve the treatment for CRC patients. This tool is generalizable to other cancer diagnosis based on image recognition."

We aim to evaluate the performance of AI-assisted cytology for the detection of histologically cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) or cancer.
METHODS: We trained a supervised deep learning algorithm based on 188,542 digital cytological images. Between Mar 13, 2017, and Oct 20, 2018, 2145 referral women from organized screening were enrolled in a multicenter, clinical-based, observational study. Cervical specimen was sampled to generate two liquid-based slides: one random slide was allocated to AI-assisted reading, and the other to manual reading conducted by skilled cytologists from senior hospital and cytology doctors from primary hospitals. HPV testing and colposcopy-directed biopsy was performed, and histological result was regarded as reference. We calculated the relative sensitivity and relative specificity of AI-assisted reading compared to manual reading for CIN2+. This trial was registered, number ChiCTR2000034131.
RESULTS: In the referral population, AI-assisted reading detected 92.6% of CIN 2 and 96.1% of CIN 3+, significantly higher than or similar to manual reading. AI-assisted reading had equivalent sensitivity (relative sensitivity 1.01, 95%CI, 0.97-1.05) and higher specificity (relative specificity 1.26, 1.20-1.32) compared to skilled cytologists; whereas higher sensitivity (1.12, 1.05-1.20) and specificity (1.36, 1.25-1.48) compared to cytology doctors. In HPV-positive women, AI-assisted reading improved specificity for CIN1 or less at no expense of reduction of sensitivity compared to manual reading.
CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted cytology may contribute to the primary cytology screening or triage. Further studies are needed in general population."

Despite the clinicians-in-the-loop DL approach having great potential, no study has systematically quantified the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians with and without the assistance of DL in image-based cancer identification.
OBJECTIVE: We systematically quantified the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians with and without the assistance of DL in image-based cancer identification.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, IEEEXplore, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published between January 1, 2012, and December 7, 2021. Any type of study design was permitted that focused on comparing unassisted clinicians and DL-assisted clinicians in cancer identification using medical imaging. Studies using medical waveform-data graphics material and those investigating image segmentation rather than classification were excluded. Studies providing binary diagnostic accuracy data and contingency tables were included for further meta-analysis. Two subgroups were defined and analyzed, including cancer type and imaging modality.
RESULTS: In total, 9796 studies were identified, of which 48 were deemed eligible for systematic review. Twenty-five of these studies made comparisons between unassisted clinicians and DL-assisted clinicians and provided sufficient data for statistical synthesis. We found a pooled sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 80%-86%) for unassisted clinicians and 88% (95% CI 86%-90%) for DL-assisted clinicians. Pooled specificity was 86% (95% CI 83%-88%) for unassisted clinicians and 88% (95% CI 85%-90%) for DL-assisted clinicians. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for DL-assisted clinicians were higher than for unassisted clinicians, at ratios of 1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.09) and 1.03 (95% CI 1.02-1.05), respectively. Similar diagnostic performance by DL-assisted clinicians was also observed across the predefined subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic performance of DL-assisted clinicians appears better than unassisted clinicians in image-based cancer identification. However, caution should be exercised, because the evidence provided in the reviewed studies does not cover all the minutiae involved in real-world clinical practice. Combining qualitative insights from clinical practice with data-science approaches may improve DL-assisted practice, although further research is required.

Auto-identification of snake images might help the avoidance of venomous snakes and also providing better treatment for patients. In this study, for the first time, it's been attempted to compare the accuracy of a series of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, ranging from the holistic to neural network algorithms. The study is performed on six snake species in Lar National Park, Tehran Province, Iran. In this research, the holistic methods [k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR)] are used in combination with a dimension reduction approach [principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)] as the feature extractor. In holistic methods (kNN, SVM, LR), the classifier in combination with PCA does not yield an accuracy of more than 50%, But the use of LDA to extract the important features significantly improves the performance of the classifier. A combination of LDA and SVM (kernel = 'rbf') is achieved to a test accuracy of 84%. Compared to holistic methods, convolutional neural networks show similar to better performance, and accuracy reaches 93.16% using MobileNetV2. Visualizing intermediate activation layers in VGG model reveals that just in deep activation layers, the color pattern and the shape of the snake contribute to the discrimination of snake species. This study presents MobileNetV2 as a powerful deep convolutional neural network algorithm for snake image classification that could be used even on mobile devices. This finding pave the road for generating mobile applications for snake image identification."

It has issues related to storage space and speed. This study shows that COVLIAS 2.0 uses pruned AI (PAI) networks for improving both storage and speed, wiliest high performance on lung segmentation and lesion localization.
METHOD: ology: The proposed study uses multicenter ∼9,000 CT slices from two different nations, namely, CroMed from Croatia (80 patients, experimental data), and NovMed from Italy (72 patients, validation data). We hypothesize that by using pruning and evolutionary optimization algorithms, the size of the AI models can be reduced significantly, ensuring optimal performance. Eight different pruning techniques (i) differential evolution (DE), (ii) genetic algorithm (GA), (iii) particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), and (iv) whale optimization algorithm (WO) in two deep learning frameworks (i) Fully connected network (FCN) and (ii) SegNet were designed. COVLIAS 2.0 was validated using ""Unseen NovMed"" and benchmarked against MedSeg. Statistical tests for stability and reliability were also conducted.
RESULTS: Pruning algorithms (i) FCN-DE, (ii) FCN-GA, (iii) FCN-PSO, and (iv) FCN-WO showed improvement in storage by 92.4%, 95.3%, 98.7%, and 99.8% respectively when compared against solo FCN, and (v) SegNet-DE, (vi) SegNet-GA, (vii) SegNet-PSO, and (viii) SegNet-WO showed improvement by 97.1%, 97.9%, 98.8%, and 99.2% respectively when compared against solo SegNet. AUC > 0.94 (p < 0.0001) on CroMed and > 0.86 (p < 0.0001) on NovMed data set for all eight EA model. PAI <0.25 s per image.

Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they tend not to support output from disparate pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow BIDS best practices. Here we present XCP-D, which presents a solution to these issues. XCP-D is a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University at Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Singularity image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NifTI or CIFTI files, following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, and ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded >3,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data."

It is possible that an interaction exists between pain and somatosensory impairment and that a change in one may influence the other. We therefore investigated the presence of chronic pain and self-reported altered somatosensory ability in individuals with stroke, aiming to determine if chronic pain is more common in stroke survivors with somatosensory impairment than in those without.
METHODS: Stroke survivors were invited to complete an online survey that included demographics, details of the stroke, presence of chronic pain, and any perceived changes in body sensations post-stroke.
RESULTS: Survivors of stroke (n = 489) completed the survey with 308 indicating that they experienced chronic pain and 368 reporting perceived changes in somatosensory function. Individuals with strokes who reported altered somatosensory ability were more likely to experience chronic pain than those who did not (OR = 1.697; 95% CI 1.585, 2.446). Further, this difference was observed for all categories of sensory function that were surveyed (detection of light touch, body position, discrimination of surfaces and temperature, and haptic object recognition).
CONCLUSIONS: The results point to a new characteristic of chronic pain in strokes, regardless of nature or region of the pain experienced, and raises the potential of somatosensory impairment being a rehabilitation target to improve pain-related outcomes for stroke survivors."

One possible explanation for limited interexpert reliability for a diagnosis of plus disease is that experts deviate from the published definitions.
OBJECTIVE: To identify vascular features used by experts for diagnosis of plus disease through quantitative image analysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A computer-based image analysis system (Imaging and Informatics in ROP [i-ROP]) was developed using a set of 77 digital fundus images, and the system was designed to classify images compared with a reference standard diagnosis (RSD). System performance was analyzed as a function of the field of view (circular crops with a radius of 1-6 disc diameters) and vessel subtype (arteries only, veins only, or all vessels). Routine ROP screening was conducted from June 29, 2011, to October 14, 2014, in neonatal intensive care units at 8 academic institutions, with a subset of 73 images independently classified by 11 ROP experts for validation. The RSD was compared with the majority diagnosis of experts.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the percentage of accuracy of the i-ROP system classification of plus disease, with the RSD as a function of the field of view and vessel type. Secondary outcome measures included the accuracy of the 11 experts compared with the RSD.
RESULTS: Accuracy of plus disease diagnosis by the i-ROP computer-based system was highest (95%; 95% CI, 94%-95%) when it incorporated vascular tortuosity from both arteries and veins and with the widest field of view (6-disc diameter radius). Accuracy was 90% or less when using only arterial tortuosity and 85% or less using a 2- to 3-disc diameter view similar to the standard published photograph. Diagnostic accuracy of the i-ROP system (95%) was comparable to that of 11 expert physicians (mean 87%, range 79%-99%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Experts in ROP appear to consider findings from beyond the posterior retina when diagnosing plus disease and consider tortuosity of both arteries and veins, in contrast with published definitions. It is feasible for a computer-based image analysis system to perform comparably with ROP experts, using manually segmented images."

However, predictors have varied across studies.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the predictors of 30-day CVE post-TAVR.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies that reported the incidence of CVE post-TAVR while providing raw data for predictors of interest was performed. Data on study, patient, and procedural characteristics were extracted. Crude risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals for each predictor were calculated.
RESULTS: Sixty-four studies involving 72,318 patients (2,385 patients with a CVE within 30 days post-TAVR) were analyzed. Incidence of CVE ranged from 1% to 11% (median 4%) without significant differences between single and multicenter studies, or according to CVE adjudication availability. The summary RRs indicated lower risk for men (RR: 0.82; p = 0.02) and higher risk for patients with chronic kidney disease (RR: 1.29; p = 0.03) and with new-onset atrial fibrillation post-TAVR (RR: 1.85; p = 0.005), and for procedures performed within the first half of center experience (RR: 1.55; p = 0.003). The use of balloon post-dilation tended to be associated with a higher risk of CVE (RR: 1.43; p = 0.07). Valve type (balloon-expandable vs. self-expandable, p = 0.26) and approach (transfemoral vs. nontransfemoral, p = 0.81) did not predict CVE.
CONCLUSIONS: Female sex, chronic kidney disease, enrollment date, and new-onset atrial fibrillation were predictors of CVE post-TAVR. This study provides effect estimates to identify high-risk TAVR patients for early CVE, providing possible guidance for tailored preventive strategies."

The automation of hippocampal segmentation has been investigated in normal aging, epilepsy, and in Alzheimer's disease. Our first goal was to compare manual and automated hippocampal segmentation in ischemic stroke and to, secondly, study the impact of stroke lesion presence on hippocampal volume estimation. We used eight automated methods to segment T1-weighted MR images from 105 ischemic stroke patients and 39 age-matched controls sampled from the Cognition And Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. The methods were: AdaBoost, Atlas-based Hippocampal Segmentation (ABHS) from the IDeALab, Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) using 3 atlas variants (Hammers, LPBA40 and Neuromorphometics), FIRST, FreeSurfer v5.3, and FreeSurfer v6.0-Subfields. A number of these methods were employed to re-segment the T1 images for the stroke group after the stroke lesions were masked (i.e., removed). The automated methods were assessed on eight measures: process yield (i.e. segmentation success rate), correlation (Pearson's R and Shrout's ICC), concordance (Lin's RC and Kandall's W), slope 'a' of best-fit line from correlation plots, percentage of outliers from Bland-Altman plots, and significance of control-stroke difference. We eliminated the redundant measures after analysing between-measure correlations using Spearman's rank correlation. We ranked the automated methods based on the sum of the remaining non-redundant measures where each measure ranged between 0 and 1. Subfields attained an overall score of 96.3%, followed by AdaBoost (95.0%) and FIRST (94.7%). CAT using the LPBA40 atlas inflated hippocampal volumes the most, while the Hammers atlas returned the smallest volumes overall. FIRST (p = 0.014), FreeSurfer v5.3 (p = 0.007), manual tracing (p = 0.049), and CAT using the Neuromorphometics atlas (p = 0.017) all showed a significantly reduced hippocampal volume mean for the stroke group compared to control at three months. Moreover, masking of the stroke lesions prior to segmentation resulted in hippocampal volumes which agreed less with manual tracing. These findings recommend an automated segmentation without lesion masking as a more reliable procedure for the estimation of hippocampal volume in ischemic stroke."

Epub 2014 Nov 15.,Lewis PM,Brain Res,2015,2014/12/03,,,10.1016/j.brainres.2014.11.020,"The field of neurobionics offers hope to patients with sensory and motor impairment. Blindness is a common cause of major sensory loss, with an estimated 39 million people worldwide suffering from total blindness in 2010. Potential treatment options include bionic devices employing electrical stimulation of the visual pathways. Retinal stimulation can restore limited visual perception to patients with retinitis pigmentosa, however loss of retinal ganglion cells precludes this approach. The optic nerve, lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex provide alternative stimulation targets, with several research groups actively pursuing a cortically-based device capable of driving several hundred stimulating electrodes. While great progress has been made since the earliest works of Brindley and Dobelle in the 1960s and 1970s, significant clinical, surgical, psychophysical, neurophysiological, and engineering challenges remain to be overcome before a commercially-available cortical implant will be realized. Selection of candidate implant recipients will require assessment of their general, psychological and mental health, and likely responses to visual cortex stimulation. Implant functionality, longevity and safety may be enhanced by careful electrode insertion, optimization of electrical stimulation parameters and modification of immune responses to minimize or prevent the host response to the implanted electrodes. Psychophysical assessment will include mapping the positions of potentially several hundred phosphenes, which may require repetition if electrode performance deteriorates over time. Therefore, techniques for rapid psychophysical assessment are required, as are methods for objectively assessing the quality of life improvements obtained from the implant. These measures must take into account individual differences in image processing, phosphene distribution and rehabilitation programs that may be required to optimize implant functionality. In this review, we detail these and other challenges facing developers of cortical visual prostheses in addition to briefly outlining the epidemiology of blindness, and the history of cortical electrical stimulation in the context of visual prosthetics."

METHODS: T2W and DWI/ADC MRIs from 649 rectal cancer patients were retrospectively acquired in 9 centers. Fifty-two imaging features (14 first-order/6 shape/32 higher-order) were extracted from each scan using whole-volume (expert/non-expert) and single-slice segmentations using two different software packages (PyRadiomics/CapTk). Influence of hardware, acquisition, and patient-intrinsic factors (age/gender/cTN-stage) on ADC was assessed using linear regression. Feature reproducibility was assessed between segmentation methods and software packages using the intraclass correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Image features differed significantly (p < 0.001) between centers with more substantial variations in ADC compared to T2W-MRI. In total, 64.3% of the variation in mean ADC was explained by differences in hardware and acquisition, compared to 0.4% by patient-intrinsic factors. Feature reproducibility between expert and non-expert segmentations was good to excellent (median ICC 0.89-0.90). Reproducibility for single-slice versus whole-volume segmentations was substantially poorer (median ICC 0.40-0.58). Between software packages, reproducibility was good to excellent (median ICC 0.99) for most features (first-order/shape/GLCM/GLRLM) but poor for higher-order (GLSZM/NGTDM) features (median ICC 0.00-0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant variations are present in multicenter MRI data, particularly related to differences in hardware and acquisition, which will likely negatively influence subsequent analysis if not corrected for. Segmentation variations had a minor impact when using whole volume segmentations. Between software packages, higher-order features were less reproducible and caution is warranted when implementing these in prediction models.
KEY POINTS: • Features derived from T2W-MRI and in particular ADC differ significantly between centers when performing multicenter data analysis. • Variations in ADC are mainly (> 60%) caused by hardware and image acquisition differences and less so (< 1%) by patient- or tumor-intrinsic variations. • Features derived using different image segmentations (expert/non-expert) were reproducible, provided that whole-volume segmentations were used. When using different feature extraction software packages with similar settings, higher-order features were less reproducible."

Epub 2018 Oct 17.,Teplyi V,Skin Res Technol,2019,2018/10/18,,,10.1111/srt.12634,"BACKGROUND: The application of new techniques of the scars' correction requires the objective evaluation of their vascularization.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of digital program ImageJ in assessing neovascularization of pathologic scars.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 25 patients with pathologic scars were enrolled. Vessel selection in the first set of digital images of their scars was performed by computer processing started from thresholding with subsequent manual correction. In the second set of the same pictures, Vessel Analysis plugin was used. Comparison of both approaches was performed by three independent investigators. The time required for images processing was measured.
RESULTS: The average time that image processing and calculation have taken in the first group (753.3 ± 88.02 seconds) was statistically longer (P < 0.0001) than in the second one (358.1 ± 105.91 seconds). Independent investigators scored the precision of vessel selection in the first group as 80.4 ± 9.82, in the second group as 72.6 ± 10.53 (P < 0.0001). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test demonstrated higher precision of vessel selection by method that involves manual correction (P < 0.001). The results of Vascular Density measurements were obviously overestimated in the second group. More expedient looks calculation of the Vascular Length Density: ratio of skeletonized vasculature area to total area. Skeletonization avoids overestimation of Vascular Density, but the density of the vessel mesh can be determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Computer processing of the scars' digital photographs using ImageJ software gives cheap, technically easy and not cumbersome way of superficial scars' vascularization objectifying. Vessel selection with subsequent manual correction has advantage of higher precision."

In this study, we demonstrate how deep learning framework can be used for an automatic classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) subtypes, and for identification of features that predict survival outcome from digital histopathological images. Convolutional neural networks (CNN's) trained on whole-slide images distinguish clear cell and chromophobe RCC from normal tissue with a classification accuracy of 93.39% and 87.34%, respectively. Further, a CNN trained to distinguish clear cell, chromophobe and papillary RCC achieves a classification accuracy of 94.07%. Here, we introduced a novel support vector machine-based method that helped to break the multi-class classification task into multiple binary classification tasks which not only improved the performance of the model but also helped to deal with data imbalance. Finally, we extracted the morphological features from high probability tumor regions identified by the CNN to predict patient survival outcome of most common clear cell RCC. The generated risk index based on both tumor shape and nuclei features are significantly associated with patient survival outcome. These results highlight that deep learning can play a role in both cancer diagnosis and prognosis."

When applied to regional volumes derived from T1-weighted MRI (two studies; 2,832 participants; 8,146 scans) including cognitively normal individuals and those with cognitive impairment and dementia, Smile-GAN identified four patterns or axes of neurodegeneration. Applying this framework to longitudinal data revealed two distinct progression pathways. Measures of expression of these patterns predicted the pathway and rate of future neurodegeneration. Pattern expression offered complementary performance to amyloid/tau in predicting clinical progression.

While comprehensive assessment of the neuropsychological profile of children with ASD has been the focus of recent research, most of the published evidence originates from single centres. Though studies on differences in neuropsychological features of children with ASD across countries are essential for identifying different phenotypes of ASD, such studies have not been conducted.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess the neuropsychological abilities of children with ASD in northern Finland and Egypt and to examine the effect of age and intelligence quotient (IQ) on these abilities.
DESIGN: Selected verbal and non-verbal subtests of the neuropsychological assessment NEPSY were used to examine 88 children with ASD in northern Finland (n=54, age M=11.2, IQ M=117.1) and Egypt (n=34, age M=8.4, IQ M=96.6).
RESULTS: Finnish ASD children scored significantly higher than their Egyptian counterparts on the verbal NEPSY subtests Comprehension of Instructions (p<0.001), Comprehension of Sentence Structure (p<0.01), Narrative Memory (p<0.001) and Verbal Fluency (p<0.05) and on the non-verbal NEPSY subtest Design Fluency (p<0.01). Finnish and Egyptian ASD children did not differ on the subtests Memory for Faces, Object Recognition and Object Memory. In addition, we found that age and verbal IQ can have significant influence on neuropsychological performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible cultural impact on verbal and visuomotor fluency. However, the ability to recognize and memorize objects and the disability to remember faces appear to be typical for ASD and culturally independent."

GANs consist of a generative model and a discriminative model trained in an adversarial setting to generate realistic and novel data. In the context of image synthesis, the generator produces synthetic images, whereas the discriminator determines their authenticity by comparing them with real examples. Through iterative training, the generator allows the creation of images that are indistinguishable from real ones, leading to high-quality image generation. Considering their success in computer vision, GANs hold great potential for medical diagnostic applications. In the medical field, GANs can generate images of rare diseases, aid in learning, and be used as visualization tools. GANs can leverage unlabeled medical images, which are large in size, numerous in quantity, and challenging to annotate manually. GANs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis and have the potential to significantly impact digital histopathology. This review article focuses on the emerging use of GANs in digital histopathology, examining their applications and potential challenges. Histopathology plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis, and GANs can contribute by generating realistic microscopic images. However, ethical considerations arise because of the reliance on synthetic or pseudogenerated images. Therefore, the manuscript also explores the current limitations and highlights the ethical considerations associated with the use of this technology. In conclusion, digital histopathology has seen an emerging use of GANs for image enhancement, such as color (stain) normalization, virtual staining, and ink/marker removal. GANs offer significant potential in transforming digital pathology when applied to specific and narrow tasks (preprocessing enhancements). Evaluating data quality, addressing biases, protecting privacy, ensuring accountability and transparency, and developing regulation are imperative to ensure the ethical application of GANs."

While a vertebral fracture is the archetypal fracture of osteoporosis, it is also the most difficult to diagnose clinically. Patients often suffer further spine or other fractures, deformity, height loss and pain before diagnosis. There were an estimated 520,000 fragility fractures in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017 (costing £4.5 billion), a figure set to increase 30% by 2030. One way to improve both vertebral fracture identification and the diagnosis of osteoporosis is to assess a patient's spine or hips during routine computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients attend routine CT for diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions, but the skeleton can be overlooked as radiologists concentrate on the primary reason for scanning. More than half a million CT scans done each year in the National Health Service (NHS) could potentially be screened for osteoporosis (increasing 5% annually). If CT-based screening became embedded in practice, then the technique could have a positive clinical impact in the identification of fragility fracture and/or low bone density. Several companies have developed software methods to diagnose osteoporosis/fragile bone strength and/or identify vertebral fractures in CT datasets, using various methods that include image processing, computational modelling, artificial intelligence and biomechanical engineering concepts. Technology to evaluate Hounsfield units is used to calculate bone density, but not necessarily bone strength. In this rapid evidence review, we summarise the current literature underpinning approved technologies for opportunistic screening of routine CT images to identify fractures, bone density or strength information. We highlight how other new software technologies have become embedded in NHS clinical practice (having overcome barriers to implementation) and highlight how the novel osteoporosis technologies could follow suit. We define the key unanswered questions where further research is needed to enable the adoption of these technologies for maximal patient benefit."

The brain plays a critical role in regulating energy balance. Some human studies have demonstrated increased preference for high fat and high sugar foods in people reporting greater stress exposure. We have examined neurochemical changes in the brain in rodent models during the development of obesity, including the impact of obesity on cognition, reward neurocircuitry and stress responsiveness. Using supermarket foods high in fat and sugar, we showed that such a diet leads to changes in neurotransmitters involved in the hedonic appraisal of foods, indicative of an addiction-like capacity of foods high in fat and/or sugar. Importantly, withdrawal of the palatable diet led to a stress-like response. Furthermore, access to this palatable diet attenuated the physiological effects of acute stress (restraint), indicating that it could act as a comfort food. In more chronic studies, the diet also attenuated anxiety-like behavior in rats exposed to stress (maternal separation) early in life, but these rats may suffer greater metabolic harm than rats exposed to the early life stressor but not provided with the palatable diet. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. However, as little as 1 week of exposure to a high fat, high sugar diet selectively impaired place but not object recognition memory in the rat. Excess sugar alone had similar effects, and both diets were linked to increased inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, a critical region involved in memory. Obesity-related inflammatory changes have been found in the human brain. Ongoing work examines interventions to prevent or reverse diet-induced cognitive impairments. These data have implications for minimizing harm caused by unhealthy eating."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled. The two CT protocols were applied using Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR™) 40% but different noise indexes, recording dose-length product (DLP) and volume computed tomography dose index (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>). The subjective IQ was rated based on the distinction of anatomic details using a 4-point Likert scale based on the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for CT. For each patient, two single CTs, at enrollment (group 1) and at follow-up after lowering the dose (group 2), were evaluated by two radiologists evaluating, for each examination, five different lung regions (central zone-CZ; peripheral zone-PZ; sub-pleural region-SPR; centrilobular region-CLR; and apical zone-AZ). An inter-observer agreement was expressed by weighted Cohen's kappa statistics (k) and intra-individual differences of subjective image analysis through visual grading characteristic (VGC) analysis.
RESULTS: An average 50.4% reduction in CTDI<sub>vol</sub> and 51.5% reduction in DLP delivered were observed using the dose-reduced protocol. An agreement between observers evaluating group 1 CTs was perfect (100%) and moderate to good in group 2 examinations (k-Cohen ranging from 0.56 for PZ and AZ to 0.70 for SPR). In the VGC analysis, image quality ratings were significantly better for group 1 than group 2 scans for all regions (AUC<sub>VGC</sub> ranging from 0.56 for CZ to 0.62). However, disagreement was limited to a score 4 (excellent)-to-score 3 (good) IQ transition; apart from a single case in PZ, both the observers scored the IQ at follow-up as 2 (sufficient) starting from a score 4 (excellent).
CONCLUSION: Dose reduction achieved in the follow-up CT scans, although a lower IQ still allows a good diagnostic confidence."

Manually locating cooling towers from aerial imagery during outbreak investigations requires expertise, is labour intensive, and can be prone to errors. We aimed to train a deep learning computer vision model to automatically detect cooling towers that are aerially visible.
METHODS: Between Jan 1 and 31, 2021, we extracted satellite view images of Philadelphia (PN, USA) and New York state (NY, USA) from Google Maps and annotated cooling towers to create training datasets. We augmented training data with synthetic data and model-assisted labelling of additional cities. Using 2051 images containing 7292 cooling towers, we trained a two-stage model using YOLOv5, a model that detects objects in images, and EfficientNet-b5, a model that classifies images. We assessed the primary outcomes of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the model against manual labelling on test datasets of 548 images, including from two cities not seen in training (Boston [MA, USA] and Athens [GA, USA]). We compared the search speed of the model with that of manual searching by four epidemiologists.
FINDINGS: The model identified visible cooling towers with 95·1% sensitivity (95% CI 94·0-96·1) and a PPV of 90·1% (95% CI 90·0-90·2) in New York City and Philadelphia. In Boston, sensitivity was 91·6% (89·2-93·7) and PPV was 80·8% (80·5-81·2). In Athens, sensitivity was 86·9% (75·8-94·2) and PPV was 85·5% (84·2-86·7). For an area of New York City encompassing 45 blocks (0·26 square miles), the model searched more than 600 times faster (7·6 s; 351 potential cooling towers identified) than did human investigators (mean 83·75 min [SD 29·5]; mean 310·8 cooling towers [42·2]).
INTERPRETATION: The model could be used to accelerate investigation and source control during outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease through the identification of cooling towers from aerial imagery, potentially preventing additional disease spread. The model has already been used by public health teams for outbreak investigations and to initialise cooling tower registries, which are considered best practice for preventing and responding to outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease.

Epub 2020 Jul 19.,Dercle L,Methods,2021,2020/07/23,,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.07.003,"Radiation therapy is a pivotal cancer treatment that has significantly progressed over the last decade due to numerous technological breakthroughs. Imaging is now playing a critical role on deployment of the clinical workflow, both for treatment planning and treatment delivery. Machine-learning analysis of predefined features extracted from medical images, i.e. radiomics, has emerged as a promising clinical tool for a wide range of clinical problems addressing drug development, clinical diagnosis, treatment selection and implementation as well as prognosis. Radiomics denotes a paradigm shift redefining medical images as a quantitative asset for data-driven precision medicine. The adoption of machine-learning in a clinical setting and in particular of radiomics features requires the selection of robust, representative and clinically interpretable biomarkers that are properly evaluated on a representative clinical data set. To be clinically relevant, radiomics must not only improve patients' management with great accuracy but also be reproducible and generalizable. Hence, this review explores the existing literature and exposes its potential technical caveats, such as the lack of quality control, standardization, sufficient sample size, type of data collection, and external validation. Based upon the analysis of 165 original research studies based on PET, CT-scan, and MRI, this review provides an overview of new concepts, and hypotheses generating findings that should be validated. In particular, it describes evolving research trends to enhance several clinical tasks such as prognostication, treatment planning, response assessment, prediction of recurrence/relapse, and prediction of toxicity. Perspectives regarding the implementation of an AI-based radiotherapy workflow are presented."

Peripheral blood (PB) examination is simple and basic that can be performed in any facility. We aimed to investigate whether PB examination can predict prognosis in coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
METHODS: Complete blood count (CBC) and PB cell morphology were examined in 38 healthy controls (HCs) and 40 patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19, including 26 mild and 14 severe cases, were hospitalized in Juntendo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between April 1 and August 6, 2020. PB examinations were performed using Sysmex XN-3000 automated hematology analyzer and Sysmex DI-60 employing the convolutional neural network-based automatic image-recognition system.
RESULTS: Compared with mild cases, severe cases showed a significantly higher incidence of anemia, lymphopenia, and leukocytosis (P < .001). Granular lymphocyte counts were normal or higher in mild cases and persistently decreased in fatal cases. Temporary increase in granular lymphocytes was associated with survival of patients with severe infection. Red cell distribution width was significantly higher in severe cases than in mild cases (P < .001). Neutrophil dysplasia was consistently observed in COVID-19 cases, but not in HCs. Levels of giant neutrophils and toxic granulation/Döhle bodies were increased in severe cases.
CONCLUSION: Basic PB examination can be useful to predict the prognosis of COVID-19, by detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced multi-lineage changes in blood cell counts and morphological anomalies. These changes were dynamically correlated with disease severity and may be associated with disruption of hematopoiesis and the immunological system due to bone marrow stress in severe infection."

METHODS: Color fundus, fundus autofluoresence, and near-infrared images of 278 eyes from 230 patients with or without presence of RPD were used in this study. All eyes were scored for presence of RPD during single- and multimodality setups by two experienced observers and a developed machine learning system. Furthermore, automatic quantification of RPD area was performed by the proposed system and compared with human delineations.
RESULTS: Observers obtained a higher performance and better interobserver agreement for RPD detection with multimodality grading, achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.940 and 0.958, and a κ agreement of 0.911. The proposed automatic system achieved an area under the ROC of 0.941 with a multimodality setup. Automatic RPD quantification resulted in an intraclass correlation (ICC) value of 0.704, which was comparable with ICC values obtained between single-modality manual delineations.
CONCLUSIONS: Observer performance and agreement for RPD identification improved significantly by using a multimodality grading approach. The developed automatic system showed similar performance as observers, and automatic RPD area quantification was in concordance with manual delineations. The proposed automatic system allows for a fast and accurate identification and quantification of RPD, opening the way for efficient quantitative imaging biomarkers in large data set analysis."

There is a significant role for AI in sexual education, particularly its use in interactive, empathetic chatbots. AI's integration into health care as a decision support tool for primary health-care providers can boost real-time diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, AI's use in big data can enhance real-time epidemiology, predictive analysis, and directed interventions at population levels. However, challenges such as real-world diagnostic accuracy, liability, privacy concerns, and ethical dilemmas persist. Future directions include an emphasis on inclusivity, language accommodation, and swift research-to-practice transitions.

The majority of cervical cancer cases occur in developing countries. The WHO has proposed screening 70% of women with high-performance tests between 35 and 45 years of age by 2030 to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer. Due to an inadequate health infrastructure and organized screening strategy, most low- and middle-income countries are still far from achieving this goal. As part of the efforts to increase performance of cervical cancer screening, it is necessary to investigate the most accurate, efficient, and effective methods and strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding its application in cancer screening and diagnosis and deep learning algorithms have offered human-like interpretation capabilities on various medical images.

Although these microscopic images can be interpreted readily by trained personnel, quantitative image analysis software could facilitate the use of this technology in low-resource settings. In this study, we developed and evaluated quantitative image analysis criteria for the evaluation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic squamous esophageal mucosa.
METHODS: We performed an image analysis of 177 patients undergoing standard upper endoscopy for screening or surveillance of esophageal squamous neoplasia, using high-resolution microendoscopy, at 2 hospitals in China and at 1 hospital in the United States from May 2010 to October 2012. Biopsy specimens were collected from imaged sites (n = 375), and a consensus diagnosis was provided by 2 expert gastrointestinal pathologists and used as the standard.
RESULTS: Quantitative information from the high-resolution images was used to develop an algorithm to identify high-grade squamous dysplasia or invasive squamous cell cancer, based on histopathology findings. Optimal performance was obtained using the mean nuclear area as the basis for classification, resulting in sensitivities and specificities of 93% and 92% in the training set, 87% and 97% in the test set, and 84% and 95% in an independent validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution microendoscopy with quantitative image analysis can aid in the identification of esophageal squamous neoplasia. Use of software-based image guides may overcome issues of training and expertise in low-resource settings, allowing for widespread use of these optical biopsy technologies."

However, no investigators have employed automated image analysis on whole slide images to permit CD8 scores for use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an image analysis algorithm to automatically quantify CD8 T cells in patients with oropharyngeal HNSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using brightfield image analysis results were cross-validated with fluorescence based quantification (AQUA™). A nuclear image algorithm designed to run on whole slide images was optimized to manual count. The algorithm was locked down and used on a cohort of whole tissue sections from HNSCC patients. Multivariate clinicopathologic parameters and outcomes were statistically correlated with image analysis results.
RESULTS: Linear correlation between manual counts and the customized CD8 algorithm was 0.943. A total of 74 oropharyngeal HNSCC cases were analyzed for CD8 immune cell infiltrate using this image analysis algorithm. A CD8 immune cell density above 136 cells/mm2 was associated with median survival of 18 years compared to 5 years. When multivariate modeling was performed, HPV infection was the only predictor of survival; however, when HPV was excluded only CD8 cell density predicts survival.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the successful technical development and clinical validation of an image algorithm to automate CD8 immune cell density for oropharyngeal HNSCC. Employing brightfield image analysis on entire tumor sections instead of tumor subcompartments permits this strategy to be widely implemented."

Our understanding of the etiology of fatigue in older adults with or without PD is limited and it remains unclear whether fatigue in PD is specifically related to PD pathology. The objective of this study was thus to determine whether fatigue in PD was associated with structural changes in gray or white matter and explore whether these changes were similar in older adults without PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (T<sub>1</sub> weighted) and diffusion tensor imaging were performed in 60 patients with PD (17 females; age = 67.58 ± 5.51; disease duration = 5.67 ± 5.83 years) and 41 age- and sex- matched healthy controls. FSL image processing was used to measure gray matter volume, fractional anisotropy, and leukoariosis differences. Voxel-based morphometry confirmed gray matter loss across the dorsal striatum and insula in the PD patient cohort. PD patients with fatigue had reduced gray matter volume in dorsal striatum relative to PD patients without fatigue (P &lt; 0.05 False Discovery Rate corrected). No significant fatigue-related structural atrophy was found in controls. There were no areas of significant fractional anisotropy differences between high and low fatigue subjects in either the PD or non-PD groups. Control participants with high fatigue, but not PD, showed significantly greater total leukoariosis volumes (p = 0.03). Fatigue in PD is associated with unique structural changes in the caudate and putamen suggesting fatigue in PD is primarily related to PD pathology, particularly in the dorsal striatum, and not simply a consequence of aging."

METHODS: In our retrospective single-center-study, cumulative air kerma (AK), cumulative dose area product (DAP), total fluoroscopy time and contrast agent were collected from an age- and BMI-matched collective of 108 patients undergoing TIPS implantation. 54 procedures were performed before and 54 after the technology upgrade. Mean values were calculated and compared using two-tailed t-tests. Two blinded, independent readers assessed DSA image quality using a four-rank likert scale and the Wilcoxcon test.
RESULTS: The new technology demonstrated a significant reduction of 57% of mean DAP (402.8 vs. 173.3Gycm2, p&lt;0.001) and a significant reduction of 58% of mean AK (1.7 vs. 0.7Gy, p&lt;0.001) compared to the precursor technology. Time of fluoroscopy (26.4 vs. 27.8min, p=0.45) and amount of contrast agent (109.4 vs. 114.9ml, p=0.62) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The DSA image quality of the new technology was not inferior (2.66 vs. 2.77, p=0.56).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study the new imaging technology halved radiation dose in patients undergoing TIPS maintaining sufficient image quality without a significant increase in radiation time or contrast consumption."

However, a significant number of cases still pose a diagnostic challenge. The authors have attempted to design a computer model to aid in the diagnosis of these biopsies.
METHODS: Images were captured of cell clusters on ThinPrep slides from 75 pancreatic FNA cases (20 malignant, 24 benign, and 31 atypical). A K-means clustering algorithm was used to segment the cell clusters into separable regions of interest before extracting features similar to those used for cytomorphologic assessment. A multilayer perceptron neural network (MNN) was trained and then tested for its ability to distinguish benign from malignant cases.
RESULTS: A total of 277 images of cell clusters were obtained. K-means clustering identified 68,301 possible regions of interest overall. Features such as contour, perimeter, and area were found to be significantly different between malignant and benign images (P <.05). The MNN was 100% accurate for benign and malignant categories. The model's predictions from the atypical data set were 77% accurate.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that computer models can be used successfully to distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic cytology. The fact that the model can categorize atypical cases into benign or malignant with 77% accuracy highlights the great potential of this technology.

In the municipality of Barcarena, Pará, from 2007 to 2014, occurred the highest prevalence of this disease in Brazil.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the disease distribution related to epidemiological, environmental and demographic variables, in the area and period of the study.
METHODS: Epidemiological and demographic data of Barcarena Health Department and satellite images from the National Institute For Space Research (INPE) were used. The deforestation data were obtained through satellite image classification, using artificial neural network. The statistical significance was done with the χ2 test, and the spatial dependence tests among the variables were done using Kernel and Moran techniques.
RESULTS: The epidemiological curve indicated a disease seasonal pattern. The major percentage of the cases were in male, brown skin color, adult, illiterate, urban areas and with probable oral contamination. It was confirmed the spatial dependence of the disease cases with the different types of deforestation identified in the municipality, as well as agglomerations of cases in urban and rural areas. Discussion: The disease distribution did not occur homogeneously, possibly due to the municipality demographic dynamics, with intense migratory flows that generates the deforestation.
CONCLUSION: Different relationships among the variables studied and the occurrence of the disease in the municipality were observed. The technologies used were satisfactory to construct the disease epidemiological scenarios."

Epub 2015 Sep 28.,Wang X,J Neurosci Methods,2016,2015/09/30,PMC4666413,,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.09.010,"PURPOSE: Perivascular spaces (PVS) are associated with ageing, cerebral small vessel disease, inflammation and increased blood brain barrier permeability. Most studies to date use visual rating scales to assess PVS, but these are prone to observer variation.
METHODS: We developed a semi-automatic computational method that extracts PVS on bilateral ovoid basal ganglia (BG) regions on intensity-normalised T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. It uses Analyze™10.0 and was applied to 100 mild stroke patients' datasets. We used linear regression to test association between BGPVS count, volume and visual rating scores; and between BGPVS count & volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) rating scores (periventricular: PVH; deep: DWMH) & volume, atrophy rating scores and brain volume.
RESULTS: In the 100 patients WMH ranged from 0.4 to 119ml, and total brain tissue volume from 0.65 to 1.45l. BGPVS volume increased with BGPVS count (67.27, 95%CI [57.93 to 76.60], p<0.001). BGPVS count was positively associated with WMH visual rating (PVH: 2.20, 95%CI [1.22 to 3.18], p<0.001; DWMH: 1.92, 95%CI [0.99 to 2.85], p<0.001), WMH volume (0.065, 95%CI [0.034 to 0.096], p<0.001), and whole brain atrophy visual rating (1.01, 95%CI [0.49 to 1.53], p<0.001). BGPVS count increased as brain volume (as % of ICV) decreased (-0.33, 95%CI [-0.53 to -0.13], p=0.002).
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: BGPVS count and volume increased with the overall increase of BGPVS visual scores (2.11, 95%CI [1.36 to 2.86] for count and 0.022, 95%CI [0.012 to 0.031] for volume, p<0.001). Distributions for PVS count and visual scores were also similar.
CONCLUSIONS: This semi-automatic method is applicable to clinical protocols and offers quantitative surrogates for PVS load. It shows good agreement with a visual rating scale and confirmed that BGPVS are associated with WMH and atrophy measurements."

Patients are often admitted unnecessarily and at high cost. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning may help define the transient loss of consciousness event, diagnose the cause, assess short- and long-term risks, predict recurrence, and determine need for hospitalization and therapeutic intervention; however, several challenges remain, including medicolegal and ethical concerns. This collaborative statement, from a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, investigators, and scientists, focuses on the potential role of AI in syncope management with a goal to inspire creation of AI-derived clinical decision support tools that may improve patient outcomes, streamline diagnostics, and reduce health-care costs."

Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaWü study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany.
EXPOSURES: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay.
RESULTS: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic."

Although methods used to identify individuals with ILA on chest CT have included both automated quantitative and qualitative visual inspection methods, there has been not direct comparison between these two methods. To investigate this relationship, we created lung density metrics and compared these to visual assessments of ILA.
METHODS: To provide a comparison between ILA detection methods based on visual assessment we generated measures of high attenuation areas (HAAs, defined by attenuation values between -600 and -250 Hounsfield Units) in >4500 participants from both the COPDGene and Framingham Heart studies (FHS). Linear and logistic regressions were used for analyses.
RESULTS: Increased measures of HAAs (in ≥ 10 % of the lung) were significantly associated with ILA defined by visual inspection in both cohorts (P < 0.0001); however, the positive predictive values were not very high (19 % in COPDGene and 13 % in the FHS). In COPDGene, the association between HAAs and ILA defined by visual assessment were modified by the percentage of emphysema and body mass index. Although increased HAAs were associated with reductions in total lung capacity in both cohorts, there was no evidence for an association between measurement of HAAs and MUC5B promoter genotype in the FHS.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that increased measures of lung density may be helpful in determining the severity of lung volume reduction, but alone, are not strongly predictive of ILA defined by visual assessment. Moreover, HAAs were not associated with MUC5B promoter genotype."

Purpose To evaluate and compare the image quality of low-dose CT of the lumbar spine reconstructed with IR to conventional FBP, without further reduction of radiation dose. Material and Methods Low-dose CT on 55 patients was performed on a Siemens scanner using 120 kV tube voltage, 30 reference mAs, and automatic dose modulation. From raw CT data, lumbar spine CT images were reconstructed with a medium filter (B41f) using FBP and four levels of IR (levels 2-5). Five reviewers scored all images on seven image quality criteria according to the European guidelines on quality criteria for CT, using a five-grade scale. A side-by-side comparison was also performed. Results There was significant improvement in image quality for IR (levels 2-4) compared to FBP. According to visual grading regression, odds ratios of all criteria with 95% confidence intervals for IR2, IR3, IR4, and IR5 were: 1.59 (1.39-1.83), 1.74 (1.51-1.99), 1.68 (1.46-1.93), and 1.08 (0.94-1.23), respectively. In the side-by-side comparison of all reconstructions, images with IR (levels 2-4) received the highest scores. The mean overall CTDI<sub>vol</sub> was 1.70 mGy (SD 0.46; range, 1.01-3.83 mGy). Image noise decreased in a linear fashion with increased strength of IR. Conclusion Iterative reconstruction at levels 2, 3, and 4 improves image quality of low-dose CT of the lumbar spine compared to FPB."

OBJECTIVES: To determine if deep learning, specifically convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis, could detect and stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and predict acute respiratory disease (ARD) events and mortality in smokers.
METHODS: A CNN was trained using computed tomography scans from 7,983 COPDGene participants and evaluated using 1,000 nonoverlapping COPDGene participants and 1,672 ECLIPSE participants. Logistic regression (C statistic and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test) was used to assess COPD diagnosis and ARD prediction. Cox regression (C index and the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino test) was used to assess mortality.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In COPDGene, the C statistic for the detection of COPD was 0.856. A total of 51.1% of participants in COPDGene were accurately staged and 74.95% were within one stage. In ECLIPSE, 29.4% were accurately staged and 74.6% were within one stage. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE, the C statistics for ARD events were 0.64 and 0.55, respectively, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow P values were 0.502 and 0.380, respectively, suggesting no evidence of poor calibration. In COPDGene and ECLIPSE, CNN predicted mortality with fair discrimination (C indices, 0.72 and 0.60, respectively), and without evidence of poor calibration (Greenwood-Nam-D'Agnostino P values, 0.307 and 0.331, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep-learning approach that uses only computed tomography imaging data can identify those smokers who have COPD and predict who are most likely to have ARD events and those with the highest mortality. At a population level CNN analysis may be a powerful tool for risk assessment."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional review board approved study was based on retrospective interpretation of clinically indicated acquired data. The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. 81 patients with suspected pneumonia underwent smSv-CT (Brilliance iCT, Philips Healthcare; mean effective dose: 0.86±0.2mSv). Data were reconstructed using FBP and two different IR techniques iDose4™ and IMR (Philips Healthcare) at various iteration levels. Objective image noise (OIN) was measured. Two experienced readers independently assessed all images for image noise, image appearance and visibility of normal anatomic and abnormal findings. A random intercept model was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to FBP and iDose4™, IMR reduced OIN up to 88% and 72%, respectively (p&lt;0.001). A mild blotchy image appearance was seen in IMR images, affecting diagnostic confidence. iDose4™ images provided satisfactory to good image quality for visibility of normal and abnormal findings and were superior to FBP (p&lt;0.001). IMR images were significantly inferior for visibility of normal structures compared to iDose4™, while being superior for visibility of abnormal findings except for reticular pattern (p&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSION: IMR results for visibility of normal and abnormal lung findings are heterogeneous, indicating that IMR may not represent a priority technique for clinical routine. iDose4™ represents a suitable method for evaluation of lung tissue at submillisievert chest CT."

Studies have consistently shown a strong relationship between breast cancer risk and mammographic parenchymal patterns, typically assessed by percent mammographic density. This paper will review the advancing role of mammographic texture analysis as a potential novel approach to characterize the breast parenchymal tissue to augment conventional density assessment in breast cancer risk estimation.
MAIN TEXT: The analysis of mammographic texture provides refined, localized descriptors of parenchymal tissue complexity. Currently, there is growing evidence in support of textural features having the potential to augment the typically dichotomized descriptors (dense or not dense) of area or volumetric measures of breast density in breast cancer risk assessment. Therefore, a substantial research effort has been devoted to automate mammographic texture analysis, with the aim of ultimately incorporating such quantitative measures into breast cancer risk assessment models. In this paper, we review current and emerging approaches in this field, summarizing key methodological details and related studies using novel computerized approaches. We also discuss research challenges for advancing the role of parenchymal texture analysis in breast cancer risk stratification and accelerating its clinical translation.
CONCLUSIONS: The objective is to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers in the field of parenchymal pattern analysis in breast cancer risk assessment, while indicating key directions for future research."

METHODS: Seventy adult CF patients were evaluated. The development cohort comprised 17 patients treated with ivacaftor, with 45 pre-therapeutic and follow-up chest CT scans. Another cohort of 53 patients not treated with ivacaftor was used for validation. CT-density scores were calculated using fixed and adapted thresholds based on histogram characteristics, such as the mode and standard deviation. Visual CF-CT score was also calculated. Correlations between the CT scores and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>% pred), and between their changes over time were assessed.
RESULTS: On cross-sectional evaluation, the correlation coefficients between FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred and the automated scores were slightly lower to that of the visual score in the development and validation cohorts (R = up to -0.68 and -0.61, versus R = -0.72 and R = -0.64, respectively). Conversely, the correlation to FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred tended to be higher for automated scores (R = up to -0.61) than for visual score (R = -0.49) on longitudinal follow-up. Automated scores based on Mode + 3 SD and Mode +300 HU showed the highest cross-sectional (R = -0.59 to -0.68) and longitudinal (R = -0.51 to -0.61) correlation coefficients to FEV<sub>1</sub>%pred.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed CT-density score reliably quantifies high-attenuating lung structural abnormalities in CF.
KEY POINTS: • Automated CT score shows moderate to good cross-sectional correlations with FEV <sub>1</sub> %pred <sub>.</sub> • CT score has potential to be integrated into the standard reporting workflow."

Deep learning techniques are emerging soft computing technique which has been lucratively used to unravel different real-life problems such as pattern recognition (Face, Emotion, and Speech), traffic management, drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and network intrusion detection. This study confers the discipline, frameworks, and methodologies used by different deep learning techniques to diagnose different human neurological disorders. Here, one hundred and thirty-six different articles related to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosed using different deep learning techniques are studied. The morbidity and mortality rate of major neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders has also been delineated. The performance and publication trend of different deep learning techniques employed in the investigation of these diseases has been examined and analyzed. Different performance metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity have also been examined. The research implication, challenges and the future directions related to the study have also been highlighted. Eventually, the research breaches are identified and it is witnessed that there is more scope in the diagnosis of migraine, cerebral palsy and stroke using different deep learning models. Likewise, there is a potential opportunity to use and explore the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Deep Boltzmann Machine and Deep Belief Network for diagnosis of different human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders."

METHODS AND RESULTS: The attenuation-compensated technique was optimized via manipulating contrast exponent C, and compression exponent N, to achieve an optimal contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This was applied to 60 human coronary lesions (38 native and 22 stented) ex vivo conventional coronary OCT images acquired from heart autopsies of 10 patients and matching histology was available as reference. Three independent reviewers assessed the conventional and attenuation-compensated OCT images blindly for plaque characteristics and EEL detection. Conventional OCT and compensated OCT assessment were compared against histology. Using an optimized algorithm, the attenuation-compensated OCT images had a 2-fold improvement in contrast between different tissues in both stented and non-stented epicardial coronaries (P < 0.05). Overall sensitivity and specificity for plaque classification increased from 84 to 89% and from 92 to 94%, respectively, with substantial agreement among the three reviewers (Fleiss' Kappa k, 0.72 and 0.71, respectively). Furthermore, operators were 2.5 times more likely to identify the EEL contour in the attenuation-compensated OCT images (k = 0.72) than in the conventional OCT images (k = 0.36).
CONCLUSION: The attenuation-compensated technique can be retrospectively applied to conventional OCT images and improves the detection of plaque characteristics and the EEL contour. This approach could complement conventional OCT imaging in the evaluation of plaque characteristics and quantify plaque burden in the clinical setting."

CT examinations were performed with attenuation-based tube current modulation. Reference tube voltage and current were set to 120kV/25mÅs for LDCT and 80kV/4mÅs for ultra-low-dose CT. CT images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) for LDCT, and with FBP and IR for ultra-low-dose CT datasets. A reference standard was established by a consensus panel of 2 different radiologists on LDCT. Volume and diameter of the solid nodules were measured on LDCT with FBP and ultra-low dose CT with FBP and IR. Interobserver and interscan variability were analyzed and compared by the Bland-Altman method.
RESULTS: A total of 127 nodules were identified, including 105 solid nodules, 15 part solid nodules, 7 ground glass nodules. On ultra-low-dose CT scans, the effective radiation dose was 0.13±0.11mSv. A total of 113 (88.9%) and 110 (86.6%) true-positive nodules with FBP versus 117 (92.1%) and 118(92.9%) with IR were detected by two observers, respectively. The volume and size of the 105 solid nodules were measured, with mean volume/diameter of 46.5±46.6 mm(3)/5.1±1.6mm. There was no significant difference in nodule volume or diameter measurements between ultra-low-dose CT and LDCT protocols for solid nodules.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low-dose CT with iterative reconstruction has high sensitivity for lung nodule detection without significant difference in nodule size and volume measurement compared to LDCT."

In the current manuscript, we propose an automated smartphone application which monitors and evaluates the user's adherence to MD using images of the food and drinks that they consume. We define a set of rules for automatic adherence estimation, which focuses on the main MD food groups. We use a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a graph convolutional network to detect the types of foods and quantities from the users' food images and the defined set of rules to evaluate the adherence to MD. Our experiments show that our system outperforms a basic CNN in terms of recognizing food items and estimating quantity and yields comparable results as experienced dietitians when it comes to overall MD adherence estimation. As the system is novel, these results are promising; however, there is room for improvement of the accuracy by gathering and training with more data and certain refinements can be performed such as re-defining the set of rules to also be able to be used for sub-groups of MD (e.g., vegetarian type of MD)."

However, little data is available in Chinese.
OBJECTIVE: To develop norms and optimal cutoff points for the DMS48 in Chinese elders.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in seven memory clinics from five cities across China. DMS48 was applied to 369 Chinese aged 50 or older (138 cognitively normal [CN], 112 mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-A), and 119 mild AD dementia). The demographic factors which influence DMS48 scores were investigated and the norms were established considering those factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff points.
RESULTS: Age was shown to influence DMS48 scores (r = -0.36, p < 0.05), and we presented the age-stratified normative data for the DMS48. The optimal cutoff point is 42/43 for identifying cognitive impairment (MCI-A and AD dementia) against CN (sensitivity 97.80% and specificity 89.13%) and MCI-A against CN (sensitivity 86.60% and specificity 94.20%). A cutoff of 39/40 obtained good sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (94.90%) in discriminating AD dementia from CN. The age-stratified optimal cutoff points for identifying MCI-A were 43/44 for individuals aged 50 to 59 years old, 42/43 for 60 to 69 years old, 41/42 for 70 to 79 years old, and 40/41 for 80 or older, respectively (sensitivity 84.80% and specificity 95.70%).
CONCLUSION: This study proved that DMS48 is of good validation in screening MCI-A in elderly Chinese."

METHODS: Thirty-six images of 36 open-angle glaucoma patients were considered. A semiautomated image processing code was used to detect the digitalized ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery velocity waveforms and to extract the waveform parameters. Concordance correlation coefficient, two-sample t-test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to test for similarities, differences, and associations among variables.
RESULTS: Female glaucoma patients showed a statistically higher ophthalmic artery normalized distance between ascending and descending limb (p = 0.004), hypertensive glaucoma patients a statistically higher ophthalmic artery peak systolic velocity time (p = 0.025), glaucoma patients with hyperlipidemia a statistically higher ophthalmic artery resistivity index (p = 0.023) and a statistically higher ophthalmic artery peak systolic velocity acceleration (p = 0.025), glaucoma patients with cardiovascular diseases a statistically lower central retinal artery normalized distance between ascending and descending limb of the wave (p = 0.033) and a statistically higher central retinal artery period (p = 0.028), and patients with different body mass index a statistically different central retinal artery normalized distance between ascending and descending limb of the wave (p = 0.016). Groups with different disease severity, classified following the Brusini glaucoma staging system 2, showed statistically different central retinal artery normalized distance between ascending and descending limb of the wave (p < 0.001) and central retinal artery period (p = 0.016). No statistical differences were found in regard to race, diabetes status, glaucoma family history, and smoking.
DISCUSSION: Ophthalmic artery and central retinal artery computer-aided analysis of velocity waveforms could identify novel waveform parameters capable of differentiating among different demographics and disease severity of open-angle glaucoma patients."

METHODS: A total of 10 patients were studied retrospectively, with a single ectopic kidney in the pelvic cavity and a contralateral kidney at its normal anatomical position confirmed by ultrasound, computed tomography, renal dynamic imaging, etc. All images of ectopic kidneys were processed, and GFRs were measured using anterior and posterior Gates' method of renal dynamic imaging, respectively. The contralateral normal kidney was only processed on posterior imaging. The total GFRant of one patient, which was equal to the sum of the GFR of a normal kidney on posterior imaging and the GFR of an ectopic kidney on anterior imaging, was compared with the total GFRpost of two kidneys on posterior imaging, with the GFRtwo-sample from the two-sample method, and with the estimated GFR in the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. All correlation analyses were carried out between GFRs obtained from three methods, and all patients were followed up. For statistical analysis, nonparametric rank tests were used, Bland-Altman graphs were plotted.
RESULTS: The mean GFR of the ectopic kidney on anterior imaging was 27.48±12.24 ml/min/1.73 m. It was higher than the GFR (10.71±4.74 ml/min/1.73 m) on posterior imaging (t=-2.803, P<0.05). There were statistical differences between the total GFRant and the total GFRtwo-sample (Z=-2.295, P<0.05), between the total GFRant and the total GFRpost (Z=2.599, P<0.01), between the total GFRtwo-sample and the total GFRpost (Z=-2.191, P<0.05), and between the total GFRant and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (Z=-2.803, P<0.01). The bias of the total GFRant was different from that of the total GFRpost (Z=-2.191, P<0.05). There were no differences in the precision and accuracy within 30% of the total GFRant and that of the total GFRpost (precision: F=0.351, P>0.05), but there were statistical differences in the accuracy within 10% of the total GFRant and that of the total GFRpost (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The GFR measured using Gates' method of anterior image processing was more accurate than the GFR obtained on posterior image processing in reflecting the function of an ectopic pelvic kidney in renal dynamic imaging."

Accurate and reproducible estimates of the monoclonal immunoglobulin concentration are important for patient care.
OBJECTIVE: To address the optimum method for estimation of the concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulins.
METHODS: Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis were conducted by using the Helena SPIFE Touch instrument. Estimation of the protein concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin in the gamma region by computer-assisted reading was compared with the reading by technologists and pathology residents, in 300 gels. The data were compared using t-testing and analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Computer-generated readings had a consistent positive bias. The correlation coefficient of the average reading by technologists and residents with the computer generated value was 0.997. The average positive bias by the computer reading was 0.29 g per dL. The intercept on the regression analysis was 0.22 g per dL. The reading by the computer was significantly higher than each of the human-interpreted readings. The readings by the 3 human groups were not significantly different amongst them. The main reason for the higher reading by the computer was inclusion of a greater area on the anodal size of the peak on the densitometric scan.
CONCLUSIONS: Human- and computer-interpreted readings of the protein concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin have a high degree of correlation. The consistent positive bias by the computer reading occurred due to inclusion of a greater area of the densitometric scan on the anodal side of the peak. We suggest that vendors should adjust such computer programs to provide readings comparable to those generated by expert humans. We recommend manual delineation of the monoclonal peaks for measuring the concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulins."

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,Zhai L,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,2019,2018/11/16,,,10.1038/s41391-018-0111-4,"BACKGROUND: The contemporary active surveillance (AS) criteria may result in an unsatisfactory misclassification rate, which may delay curative treatment for prostate cancer patients. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), not included in any AS criteria, provides useful information for prostate cancer diagnosis. Our goal is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (PI-RADS) score, a standardized MRI reporting system, in AS candidates enrollment.
METHODS: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase for pertinent studies through June 2018. The standard methods recommended for meta-analyses of diagnostic evaluation were employed. We draw the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. Meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of confounding factors.
RESULTS: From the resulting 168 studies, 5 provided the diagnostic data on PI-RADS score and pathological results; 834 patients were included. All AS candidates in these studies were defined by Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criterion. The pooled estimates of PI-RADS 4 or 5 on adverse pathological features at radical prostatectomy (RP) among AS candidates were: sensitivity, 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-0.82); specificity, 0.63 (95% CI, 0.55-0.71); positive predictive value, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.79); negative predictive value, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.73); and diagnostic odds ratio, 6 (95% CI, 4-8). The SROC curve was positioned toward the desired upper left corner of the curve, the area under the curve was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.80). The P-value for heterogeneity was <0.01. The pathological outcomes and endorectal coils contributed to the heterogeneity of sensitivity. The evidences supporting the advantage of PI-RADS v2 over v1 were not sufficient yet.
CONCLUSION: AS candidates with PI-RADS 4 or 5 may be unsuitable for AS even though they fulfill current AS criteria. Those with PI-RADS 3 or less indicated relative safety for AS enrollment."

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials and PSM studies constitute the highest level of evidence in addressing the long-term oncologic efficacy of laparoscopic versus open resection for CLM. However, individual studies are limited by the reporting of overall survival in ways not amenable to traditional methods of meta-analysis, and violation of the proportional hazards assumption.
METHODS: Survival information of individual patients was reconstructed from the published Kaplan-Meier curves with the aid of a computer vision program. Frequentist and Bayesian survival models (taking into account random-effects and nonproportional hazards) were fitted to compare overall survival of patients who underwent laparoscopic versus open surgery. To handle long plateaus in the tails of survival curves, we also exploited ""cure models"" to estimate the fraction of patients effectively ""cured"" of disease.
RESULTS: Individual patient data from 2 randomized trials and 13 PSM studies involving 3148 participants were reconstructed. Laparoscopic resection was associated with a lower hazard rate of death (stratified hazard ratio = 0.853, 95% confidence interval: 0.754-0.965, P = 0.0114), and there was evidence of time-varying effects (P = 0.0324) in which the magnitude of hazard ratios increased over time. The fractions of long-term cancer survivors were estimated to be 47.4% and 18.0% in the laparoscopy and open surgery groups, respectively. At 10-year follow-up, the restricted mean survival time was 8.6 months (or 12.1%) longer in the laparoscopy arm (P < 0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, elderly patients (≥65 years old) treated with laparoscopy experienced longer 3-year average life expectancy (+6.2%, P = 0.018), and those who live past the 5-year milestone (46.1%) seem to be cured of disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient-level meta-analysis of high-quality studies demonstrated an unexpected survival benefit in favor of laparoscopic over open resection for CLM in the long-term. From a conservative viewpoint, these results can be interpreted to indicate that laparoscopy is at least not inferior to the standard open approach."

Epub 2017 Dec 27.,Reinders AATS,Acta Psychiatr Scand,2018,2017/12/29,,,10.1111/acps.12839,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the two constitutes of cortical volume (CV), that is, cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA), in individuals with dissociative identity disorder (DID) with the view of gaining important novel insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms mediating DID.
METHODS: This study included 32 female patients with DID and 43 matched healthy controls. Between-group differences in CV, thickness, and SA, the degree of spatial overlap between differences in CT and SA, and their relative contribution to differences in regional CV were assessed using a novel spatially unbiased vertex-wise approach. Whole-brain correlation analyses were performed between measures of cortical anatomy and dissociative symptoms and traumatization.
RESULTS: Individuals with DID differed from controls in CV, CT, and SA, with significantly decreased CT in the insula, anterior cingulate, and parietal regions and reduced cortical SA in temporal and orbitofrontal cortices. Abnormalities in CT and SA shared only about 3% of all significantly different cerebral surface locations and involved distinct contributions to the abnormality of CV in DID. Significant negative associations between abnormal brain morphology (SA and CV) and dissociative symptoms and early childhood traumatization (0 and 3 years of age) were found.
CONCLUSIONS: In DID, neuroanatomical areas with decreased CT and SA are in different locations in the brain. As CT and SA have distinct genetic and developmental origins, our findings may indicate that different neurobiological mechanisms and environmental factors impact on cortical morphology in DID, such as early childhood traumatization."

Epub 2015 Jun 17.,Chang DH,Rofo,2015,2015/06/19,,,10.1055/s-0035-1553125,"PURPOSE: To compare the radiation doses and image qualities of computed tomography (CT)-guided interventions using a standard-dose CT (SDCT) protocol with filtered back projection and a low-dose CT (LDCT) protocol with both filtered back projection and iterative reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Image quality and radiation doses (dose-length product and CT dose index) were retrospectively reviewed for 130 patients who underwent CT-guided lung interventions. SDCT at 120 kVp and automatic mA modulation and LDCT at 100 kVp and a fixed exposure were each performed for 65 patients. Image quality was objectively evaluated as the contrast-to-noise ratio and subjectively by two radiologists for noise impression, sharpness, artifacts and diagnostic acceptability on a four-point scale.
RESULTS: The groups did not significantly differ in terms of diagnostic acceptability and complication rate. LDCT yielded a median 68.6% reduction in the radiation dose relative to SDCT. In the LDCT group, iterative reconstruction was superior to filtered back projection in terms of noise reduction and subjective image quality. The groups did not differ in terms of beam hardening artifacts.
CONCLUSION: LDCT was feasible for all procedures and yielded a more than two-thirds reduction in radiation exposure while maintaining overall diagnostic acceptability, safety and precision. The iterative reconstruction algorithm is preferable according to the objective and subjective image quality analyses.
KEY POINTS: Implementation of a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) protocol for lung interventions is feasible and safe. LDCT protocols yield a significant reduction (more than 2/3) in radiation exposure. Iterative reconstruction algorithms considerably improve the image quality in LDCT protocols."

TAVR-related conduction disturbances, mainly new-onset left bundle-branch block and advanced atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation, remain the most common complication of this procedure. Furthermore, improvements in TAVR technology, akin to the increasing experience of operators/centers, have translated to a major reduction in periprocedural complications, yet the incidence of conduction disturbances has remained relatively high, with perhaps an increasing trend over time. Several factors have been associated with a heightened risk of conduction disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR, with prior right bundle-branch block and transcatheter valve type and implantation depth being the most commonly reported. New-onset left bundle-branch block and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation may have a significant detrimental association with patients' prognosis. Consequently, strategies intended to reduce the risk and to improve the management of such complications are of paramount importance, particularly in an era when TAVR expansion toward treating lower-risk patients is considered inevitable. In this article, we review the available evidence on the incidence, predictive factors, and clinical association of conduction disturbances after TAVR and propose a strategy for the management of these complications."

Methods: In this retrospective study, 79 patients with pathological confirmation of PHSC and underwent surgical resection were recruited. A radiomics nomogram was developed by radiomics signatures and independent clinical risk factors selecting from multivariate Cox regression. All patients were stratified as high risk and low risk by nomogram. Model performance and clinical usefulness were assessed by C-index, calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and survival curve. Results: A total of 79 PHSC were included with 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of 63.3% and 35.4%, respectively. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method selected 3 features. Multivariate Cox analysis found six independent prognostic factors. The radiomics nomogram showed a significant prediction value with overall survival (HR: 7.111, 95%CI: 3.933-12.858, P&lt;0.001). C-index of nomogram was 0.855 and 0.829 in training and validation set, respectively. Decision curve analysis validated the clinical utility of this nomogram. There was a significant difference in the 1-year and 3-year survival rates of stratified high-risk and low-risk patients in the whole cohort (30.6% vs. 90.1% and 5.6% vs. 62.4%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This radiomics nomogram serve as a potential tool for predicting prognosis of PHSC after surgical resection, and help to identify high risk patients who may obtain feeble survival benefit from surgical resection."

Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2015) was used to extract the data, and cases with cutaneous melanoma and complete information about TN stages and sites of distant metastases were explored. Performance parameters assessed in the current study included positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, number needed to investigate (NNI), and accuracy. A total of 109 971 patients were included in the analysis. If all stage III patients in the study cohort are to be staged through routine imaging, PPV (for the recognition of lung metastases) will be 2.9% and NNI to detect one case of lung metastasis will be 34. Likewise, PPV (for the recognition of bone metastases) will be 1.8% and NNI to detect one case of bone metastasis will be 55. Moreover, PPV (for the recognition of liver metastases) will be 1.8% and NNI to detect one case of liver metastasis will be 55. Excluding stage III patients with clinically node-negative/sentinel node-positive disease would improve PPV and decrease NNI for the three metastatic sites.

This study consisted of 20 patients referred for planning US to assess the feasibility of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or biopsy for focal hepatic lesions. The first 10 consecutive patients were evaluated by an experienced radiologist using the automatic registration by liver surface and vessel method, whereas the remaining 10 patients were evaluated using the automatic registration by liver surface only method. For all 20 patients, image fusion was automatically executed after following the protocols and fused real-time US and MR images moved synchronously. The accuracy of each method was evaluated by measuring the registration error, and the time required for image fusion was assessed by evaluating the recorded data using in-house software. The results obtained using the two automatic registration methods were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Image fusion was successful in all 20 patients, and the time required for image fusion was significantly shorter with the automatic registration by liver surface only method than with the automatic registration by liver surface and vessel method (median: 43.0 s, range: 29-74 s vs. median: 83.0 s, range: 46-101 s; p = 0.002). The registration error did not significantly differ between the two methods (median: 4.0 mm, range: 2.1-9.9 mm vs. median: 3.7 mm, range: 1.8-5.2 mm; p = 0.496). The automatic registration by liver surface only method offers faster image fusion between real-time US and pre-procedural MR images than does the automatic registration by liver surface and vessel method. However, the degree of accuracy was similar for the two methods."

However, knowledge of the two-photon spectral properties of the myriad fluorescent probes is generally scarce and, for many, non-existent. In addition, the use of different measurement units in published reports further hinders the design of a comprehensive imaging experiment. In this review, we compile and homogenize the two-photon spectral properties of 280 fluorescent probes. We provide practical data, including the wavelengths for optimal two-photon excitation, the peak values of two-photon action cross section or molecular brightness, and the emission ranges. Beyond the spectroscopic description of these fluorophores, we discuss their binding to biological targets. This specificity allows in vivo imaging of cells, their processes, and even organelles and other subcellular structures in the brain. In addition to probes that monitor endogenous cell metabolism, studies of healthy and diseased brain benefit from the specific binding of certain probes to pathology-specific features, ranging from amyloid-β plaques to the autofluorescence of certain antibiotics. A special focus is placed on functional in vivo imaging using two-photon probes that sense specific ions or membrane potential, and that may be combined with optogenetic actuators. Being closely linked to their use, we examine the different routes of intravital delivery of these fluorescent probes according to the target. Finally, we discuss different approaches, strategies, and prerequisites for two-photon multicolor experiments in the brains of living laboratory animals."

PCa detection is critical to personalized medicine and varies considerably under an MRI scan. 172 patients with 2,602 morphologic images (axial 2D T2-weighted imaging) of the prostate were obtained. A deep learning with deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and bag-of-word (BoW), a representative method for image recognition and analysis, were used to distinguish pathologically confirmed PCa patients from prostate benign conditions (BCs) patients with prostatitis or prostate benign hyperplasia (BPH). In fully automated detection of PCa patients, deep learning had a statistically higher area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) than non-deep learning (P = 0.0007 < 0.001). The AUCs were 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.89) for deep learning method and 0.70 (95% CI 0.63-0.77) for non-deep learning method, respectively. Our results suggest that deep learning with DCNN is superior to non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and BoW model for fully automated PCa patients differentiation from prostate BCs patients. Our deep learning method is extensible to image modalities such as MR imaging, CT and PET of other organs."

Epub 2016 May 10.,Sachdev PS,Stroke,2016,2016/05/12,,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.012532,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The genetic basis of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is still unknown. This study examines the heritability of WMH in both sexes and in different brain regions, and the influence of age.
METHODS: Participants from the Older Australian Twins Study were recruited (n=320; 92 monozygotic and 68 dizygotic pairs) who volunteered for magnetic resonance imaging scans and medical assessments. Heritability, that is, the ratio of the additive genetic variance to the total phenotypic variance, was estimated using the twin design.
RESULTS: Heritability was high for total WMH volume (0.76), and for periventricular WMH (0.64) and deep WMH (0.77), and varied from 0.18 for the cerebellum to 0.76 for the occipital lobe. The genetic correlation between deep and periventricular WMH regions was 0.85, with one additive genetics factor accounting for most of the shared variance. Heritability was consistently higher in women in the cerebral regions. Heritability in deep but not periventricular WMH declined with age, in particular after the age of 75.
CONCLUSIONS: WMH have a strong genetic influence but this is not uniform through the brain, being higher for deep than periventricular WMH and in the cerebral regions. The genetic influence is higher in women, and there is an age-related decline, most markedly for deep WMH. The data suggest some heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of WMH for different brain regions and for men and women."

Epub 2022 Jun 8.,Wu Y,Oral Oncol,2022,2022/06/11,,,10.1016/j.oraloncology.2022.105942,"OBJECTIVE: Tissue slides from Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC), particularly the epithelial regions, hold morphologic features that are both diagnostic and prognostic. Yet, previously developed approaches for automated epithelium segmentation in OC-SCC have not been independently tested in a multi-center setting. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform epithelial segmentation using digitized H&E-stained diagnostic slides from OC-SCC patients in a multi-center setting.
METHODS: A CNN model was developed to segment the epithelial regions of digitized slides (n = 810), retrospectively collected from five different centers. Deep learning models were trained and validated using well-annotated tissue microarray (TMA) images (n = 212) at various magnifications. The best performing model was locked down and used for independent testing with a total of 478 whole-slide images (WSIs). Manually annotated epithelial regions were used as the reference standard for evaluation. We also compared the model generated results with IHC-stained epithelium (n = 120) as the reference.
RESULTS: The locked-down CNN model trained on the TMA image training cohorts with 10x magnification achieved the best segmentation performance. The locked-down model performed consistently and yielded Pixel Accuracy, Recall Rate, Precision Rate, and Dice Coefficient that ranged from 95.8% to 96.6%, 79.1% to 93.8%, 85.7% to 89.3%, and 82.3% to 89.0%, respectively for the three independent testing WSI cohorts.
CONCLUSION: The automated model achieved a consistently accurate performance for automated epithelial region segmentation compared to manual annotations. This model could be integrated into a computer-aided diagnosis or prognosis system."

Recently, two automatic image fusion techniques called Positioning and Sweeping auto-registration have been developed. Purpose To compare the accuracy and required time for image fusion of real-time ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) images between Positioning and Sweeping auto-registration. Material and Methods Eighteen consecutive patients referred for planning US for radiofrequency ablation or biopsy for focal hepatic lesions were enrolled. Image fusion using both auto-registration methods was performed for each patient. Registration error, time required for image fusion, and number of point locks used were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results Image fusion was successful in all patients. Positioning auto-registration was significantly faster than Sweeping auto-registration for both initial (median, 11 s [range, 3-16 s] vs. 32 s [range, 21-38 s]; P < 0.001] and complete (median, 34.0 s [range, 26-66 s] vs. 47.5 s [range, 32-90]; P = 0.001] image fusion. Registration error of Positioning auto-registration was significantly higher for initial image fusion (median, 38.8 mm [range, 16.0-84.6 mm] vs. 18.2 mm [6.7-73.4 mm]; P = 0.029), but not for complete image fusion (median, 4.75 mm [range, 1.7-9.9 mm] vs. 5.8 mm [range, 2.0-13.0 mm]; P = 0.338]. Number of point locks required to refine the initially fused images was significantly higher with Positioning auto-registration (median, 2 [range, 2-3] vs. 1 [range, 1-2]; P = 0.012]. Conclusion Positioning auto-registration offers faster image fusion between real-time US and pre-procedural CT images than Sweeping auto-registration. The final registration error is similar between the two methods."

Therefore, functional MRI (fMRI)-based connectivity is an ideal technique for exploring the complex effects of epilepsy on the brain. Functional connectivity studies have provided insights into the physiopathogenesis of the epileptic network underlying focal epilepsies, genetic generalized epilepsy, and specific epileptic syndromes. An increasing number of studies have focused on the deleterious effects of epilepsy on other brain networks to help to explain cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms. Anti-epileptic treatment studies have yielded information about the side effects and the restoration of functional abnormalities after using the drug. Researchers who have examined predictors of surgical outcomes have suggested that there might be identifiable pre-surgical patterns of functional connectivity that are associated with a greater likelihood of positive cognitive or seizure outcomes. However, knowledge regarding the role of fMRI connectivity remains limited in clinical settings. Further validation through invasive investigations and follow-up studies is required for its reliable application in the clinical management of individual patients."

To date however, no review of these techniques and their application(s) within the domain of white blood cell (WBC) classification in blood smear images has been undertaken, representing a notable knowledge gap with respect to model selection and comparison. Accordingly, the current study sought to comprehensively identify, explore and contrast ML and DL methods for classifying WBCs. Following development and implementation of a formalized review protocol, a cohort of 136 primary studies published between January 2006 and May 2023 were identified from the global literature, with the most widely used techniques and best-performing WBC classification methods subsequently ascertained. Studies derived from 26 countries, with highest numbers from high-income countries including the United States (n = 32) and The Netherlands (n = 26). While WBC classification was originally rooted in conventional ML, there has been a notable shift toward the use of DL, and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), with 54.4% of identified studies (n = 74) including the use of CNNs, and particularly in concurrence with larger datasets and bespoke features e.g., parallel data pre-processing, feature selection, and extraction. While some conventional ML models achieved up to 99% accuracy, accuracy was shown to decrease in concurrence with decreasing dataset size. Deep learning models exhibited improved performance for more extensive datasets and exhibited higher levels of accuracy in concurrence with increasingly large datasets. Availability of appropriate datasets remains a primary challenge, potentially resolvable using data augmentation techniques. Moreover, medical training of computer science researchers is recommended to improve current understanding of leucocyte structure and subsequent selection of appropriate classification models. Likewise, it is critical that future health professionals be made aware of the power, efficacy, precision and applicability of computer science, soft computing and artificial intelligence contributions to medicine, and particularly in areas like medical imaging."

Many in vitro biofilm model systems use a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) in conjunction with image analysis tools to study biofilms. The aim of this study was to evaluate an in-house developed image analysis software program that we call BAIT (Biofilm Architecture Inference Tool) to quantify the architecture of oral multi-species biofilms following anti-biofilm interventions using a microfluidic biofilm system. Differences in architecture were compared between untreated biofilms and those treated with water (negative control), sodium gluconate ('placebo') or stannous fluoride (SnF2). The microfluidic system was inoculated with pooled human saliva and biofilms were developed over 22 h in filter-sterilized 25 % pooled human saliva. During this period, biofilms were treated with water, sodium gluconate, or SnF2 (1000, 3439 or 10 000 p.p.m. Sn2+) 8 and 18 h post-inoculation. After 22 h of growth, biofilms were stained with LIVE/DEAD stain, and imaged by CLSM. BAIT was used to calculate biofilm biovolume, total number of objects, surface area, fluffiness, connectivity, convex hull porosity and viability. Image analysis showed oral biofilm architecture was significantly altered by 3439 and 10 000 p.p.m. Sn2+ treatment regimens, resulting in decreased biovolume, surface area, number of objects and connectivity, while fluffiness increased (P&lt;0.01). In conclusion, BAIT was shown to be able to measure the changes in biofilm architecture and detects possible antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects of candidate agents."

Automated retinal image analysis systems (ARIASs) may offer an alternative to manual grading.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the screening performance and cost-effectiveness of ARIASs to replace level 1 human graders or pre-screen with ARIASs in the NHS diabetic eye screening programme (DESP). To examine technical issues associated with implementation.
DESIGN: Observational retrospective measurement comparison study with a real-time evaluation of technical issues and a decision-analytic model to evaluate cost-effectiveness.
SETTING: A NHS DESP.
PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive diabetic patients who attended a routine annual NHS DESP visit.
INTERVENTIONS: Retinal images were manually graded and processed by three ARIASs: iGradingM (version 1.1; originally Medalytix Group Ltd, Manchester, UK, but purchased by Digital Healthcare, Cambridge, UK, at the initiation of the study, purchased in turn by EMIS Health, Leeds, UK, after conclusion of the study), Retmarker (version 0.8.2, Retmarker Ltd, Coimbra, Portugal) and EyeArt (Eyenuk Inc., Woodland Hills, CA, USA). The final manual grade was used as the reference standard. Arbitration on a subset of discrepancies between manual grading and the use of an ARIAS by a reading centre masked to all grading was used to create a reference standard manual grade modified by arbitration.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity, false-positive rate and likelihood ratios) and diagnostic accuracy [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] of ARIASs. A secondary analysis explored the influence of camera type and patients' ethnicity, age and sex on screening performance. Economic analysis estimated the cost per appropriate screening outcome identified.
RESULTS: A total of 20,258 patients with 102,856 images were entered into the study. The sensitivity point estimates of the ARIASs were as follows: EyeArt 94.7% (95% CI 94.2% to 95.2%) for any retinopathy, 93.8% (95% CI 92.9% to 94.6%) for referable retinopathy and 99.6% (95% CI 97.0% to 99.9%) for proliferative retinopathy; and Retmarker 73.0% (95% CI 72.0% to 74.0%) for any retinopathy, 85.0% (95% CI 83.6% to 86.2%) for referable retinopathy and 97.9% (95% CI 94.9 to 99.1%) for proliferative retinopathy. iGradingM classified all images as either 'disease' or 'ungradable', limiting further iGradingM analysis. The sensitivity and false-positive rates for EyeArt were not affected by ethnicity, sex or camera type but sensitivity declined marginally with increasing patient age. The screening performance of Retmarker appeared to vary with patient's age, ethnicity and camera type. Both EyeArt and Retmarker were cost saving relative to manual grading either as a replacement for level 1 human grading or used prior to level 1 human grading, although the latter was less cost-effective. A threshold analysis testing the highest ARIAS cost per patient before which ARIASs became more expensive per appropriate outcome than human grading, when used to replace level 1 grader, was Retmarker £3.82 and EyeArt £2.71 per patient.
LIMITATIONS: The non-randomised study design limited the health economic analysis but the same retinal images were processed by all ARIASs in this measurement comparison study.
CONCLUSIONS: Retmarker and EyeArt achieved acceptable sensitivity for referable retinopathy and false-positive rates (compared with human graders as reference standard) and appear to be cost-effective alternatives to a purely manual grading approach. Future work is required to develop technical specifications to optimise deployment and address potential governance issues.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using SSTR PET-based Krenning score in comparison to 111In-pentetreotide. Methods: This was a post hoc head-to-head comparison of 68Ga-DOTATATE-based and 111In-pentetreotide-based Krenning scores in 150 patients included in a prospective phase 2 study (NCT01967537). Patients were imaged using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 111In-pentetreotide planar scintigraphy, and SPECT/CT within 1 wk. SSTR ligand uptake was graded using the Krenning score independently by 3 readers. Results: The detection rate of SSTR-expressing disease (Krenning scores 2-4) was 23%, 38%, and 72% with planar imaging, SPECT, and SSTR PET, respectively. The Krenning score was higher with SSTR PET (2.71 ± 1.74) than with planar imaging (0.75 ± 1.37; P &lt; 0.001) or SPECT (1.23 ± 1.57; P &lt; 0.001). In patients with a Krenning score of at least 3 on SSTR PET, the detection rate of planar imaging and SPECT was lower for lesions smaller than 2 cm than lesions 2 cm or larger: 15% and 24% versus 78% and 89%, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). For lesions larger than 5 cm, Krenning scores between SSTR PET and 111In-pentetreotide were nearly equivalent. Lesion size did not have an impact on SSTR PET Krenning scores. Interreader agreement was higher for SSTR PET than for planar imaging or SPECT (0.79 vs. 0.67 and 0.50, respectively). Conclusion: SSTR PET results in higher Krenning scores than 111In-pentetreotide, particularly when lesions measured 2 cm or less. Small lesion size resulted in low Krenning scores using 111In-pentetreotide, but lesion size did not affect SSTR PET-based Krenning scores. The results of the NETTER-1 trial cannot be directly applied to patients with small lesions. Further study of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in patients with small lesions negative on 111In-pentetreotide imaging and positive on SSTR PET is warranted."

Conventional apparatuses lack in usability requiring strong light sources and a cumbersome photographing process, and they often yield unsatisfactory analysis results. This study was conducted to develop an image processing technique for automatic facial pore analysis.
METHODS: The proposed method detects facial pores using multi-scale detection and optimal scale selection scheme and then extracts pore-related features such as total area, average size, depth, and the number of pores. Facial photographs of 50 subjects were graded by two expert dermatologists, and correlation analyses between the features and clinical grading were conducted. We also compared our analysis result with those of conventional pore-analyzing devices.
RESULTS: The number of large pores and the average pore size were highly correlated with the severity of pore enlargement. In comparison with the conventional devices, the proposed analysis system achieved better performance showing stronger correlation with the clinical grading.
CONCLUSION: The proposed system is highly accurate and reliable for measuring the severity of skin pore enlargement. It can be suitably used for objective assessment of the pore tightening treatments."

Epub 2021 Apr 23.,Park HJ,Eur Radiol,2021,2021/04/23,,,10.1007/s00330-021-07926-6,"OBJECTIVES: Current prognostic systems for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) rely on surgical pathology data and are not applicable to a preoperative setting. We aimed to develop and validate preoperative models to predict postsurgical outcomes in mass-forming IHCC patients based on clinical, radiologic, and radiomics features.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent curative-intent resection for mass-forming IHCC. In the development cohort (single institution data), three preoperative multivariable Cox models for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) were constructed, including the clinical-radiologic, radiomics, and clinical-radiologic-radiomics (CRR) models based on clinical and CT findings, CT-radiomics features, and a combination of both, respectively. Model performance was evaluated in the test cohort (data from five institutions) using Harrell's C-index and compared with postoperative prognostic systems.
RESULTS: A total of 345 patients (233, development cohort; 112, test cohort) were evaluated. The clinical-radiologic model included five independent CT predictors (infiltrative contour, multiplicity, periductal infiltration, extrahepatic organ invasion, and suspicious metastatic lymph node) and showed similar performance in predicting RFS to the radiomics model (C-index, 0.65 vs. 0.68; p = 0.43 in the test cohort). The CRR model showed significantly improved performance (C-index, 0.71; p = 0.01) than the clinical-radiologic model and demonstrated similar performance to the postoperative prognostic systems in predicting RFS (C-index, 0.71-0.73 vs. 0.70-0.73; p ≥ 0.40) and overall survival (C-index, 0.68-0.71 vs. 0.64-0.74; p ≥ 0.27) in the test cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: A model integrating clinical, CT, and radiomics information may be useful for the preoperative assessment of postsurgical outcomes in patients with mass-forming IHCC.
KEY POINTS: • The radiomics analysis had incremental value in predicting recurrence-free survival of patients with intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma. • The clinical-radiologic-radiomics model demonstrated similar performance to the postoperatively available prognostic systems (including 8th AJCC system) in predicting recurrence-free survival and overall survival. • The clinical-radiologic-radiomics model may be useful for the preoperative assessment of postsurgical outcomes in patients with mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma."

Epub 2019 Jul 3.,van Gastel MDA,J Am Soc Nephrol,2019,2019/07/05,PMC6683702,,10.1681/ASN.2018090902,"BACKGROUND: The formation and growth of cysts in kidneys, and often liver, in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cause progressive increases in total kidney volume (TKV) and liver volume (TLV). Laborious and time-consuming manual tracing of kidneys and liver is the current gold standard. We developed a fully automated segmentation method for TKV and TLV measurement that uses a deep learning network optimized to perform semantic segmentation of kidneys and liver.
METHODS: We used 80% of a set of 440 abdominal magnetic resonance images (T2-weighted HASTE coronal sequences) from patients with ADPKD to train the network and the remaining 20% for validation. Both kidneys and liver were also segmented manually. To evaluate the method's performance, we used an additional test set of images from 100 patients, 45 of whom were also involved in longitudinal analyses.
RESULTS: TKV and TLV measured by the automated approach correlated highly with manually traced TKV and TLV (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.998 and 0.996, respectively), with low bias and high precision (<0.1%±2.7% for TKV and -1.6%±3.1% for TLV); this was comparable with inter-reader variability of manual tracing (<0.1%±3.5% for TKV and -1.5%±4.8% for TLV). For longitudinal analysis, bias and precision were <0.1%±3.2% for TKV and 1.4%±2.9% for TLV growth.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a fully automated segmentation method that measures TKV, TLV, and changes in these parameters as accurately as manual tracing. This technique may facilitate future studies in which automated and reproducible TKV and TLV measurements are needed to assess disease severity, disease progression, and treatment response."

A total of 80 oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer cases were retrospectively recruited. Radiomics method was applied to the PET image for the 80 oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer cases to extract texture features from various defined metabolic volumes. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance method was used to test whether feature value difference exists between groups, which were grouped by stage, response to treatment, and recurrence. If there was a significant difference, the corresponding feature cutoff value was applied to the Kaplan-Meier estimator to estimate the survival functions. For the various defined metabolic volumes, there were 16 features that had significant differences between early (T1, T2) and late tumor stages (T3, T4). Five images and 2 textural features were found to be able to predict the tumor response and recurrence, respectively, with the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves reaching 0.7. The histogram entropy was found to be a good predictor of overall survival (OS) and primary relapse-free survival (PRFS) of oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer patients. Textural features from PET images provide predictive and prognostic information in tumor staging, tumor response, recurrence, and have the potential to be a prognosticator for OS and PRFS in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer."

We aimed to determine the prevalence of osteoporosis by opportunistic CT in patients who underwent lung cancer screening (LCS) using non-contrast CT in the Northeastern United States. Demographics including race and ethnicity were retrieved. We assessed trabecular bone and body composition using a fully-automated artificial intelligence algorithm. ROIs were placed at T12 vertebral body for attenuation measurements in Hounsfield Units (HU). Two validated thresholds were used to diagnose osteoporosis: high-sensitivity threshold (115-165 HU) and high specificity threshold (<115 HU). We performed descriptive statistics and ANOVA to compare differences across sex, race, ethnicity, and income class according to neighborhoods' mean household incomes. Forward stepwise regression modeling was used to determine body composition predictors of trabecular attenuation. We included 3708 patients (mean age 64 ± 7 years, 54 % males) who underwent LCS, had available demographic information and an evaluable CT for trabecular attenuation analysis. Using the high sensitivity threshold, osteoporosis was more prevalent in females (74 % vs. 65 % in males, p < 0.0001) and Whites (72 % vs 49 % non-Whites, p < 0.0001). However, osteoporosis was present across all races (38 % Black, 55 % Asian, 56 % Hispanic) and affected all income classes (69 %, 69 %, and 91 % in low, medium, and high-income class, respectively). High visceral/subcutaneous fat-ratio, aortic calcification, and hepatic steatosis were associated with low trabecular attenuation (p < 0.01), whereas muscle mass was positively associated with trabecular attenuation (p < 0.01). In conclusion, osteoporosis is prevalent across all races, income classes and both sexes in patients undergoing LCS. Opportunistic CT using a fully-automated algorithm and uniform imaging protocol is able to detect osteoporosis and body composition without additional testing or radiation. Early identification of patients traditionally thought to be at low risk for bone loss will allow for initiating appropriate treatment to prevent future fragility fractures.

The new assay is a multiplex one-step RT-PCR followed by automatic flow-through hybridization, colorimetric detection and image analysis. The limit of detection was 50 copies/reaction, and 10 copies/reaction for human enterovirus and the other seven viruses, respectively. The analytical validation was performed with nucleic acids extracted from 268 cerebrospinal fluid samples and the results were compared with routine molecular assays. An excellent coefficient of agreement was observed between V-CNS and routine assays [kappa index: 0.948 (95%CI: 0.928-0.968)]. The overall sensitivity and specificity was 95.9% (95%CI: 91.2-98.3%) and 99.9% (95%CI: 99.6-100%), respectively. Viral CNS Flow Chip kit is an efficient multiplex platform for the detection of the main viruses involved in acute meningitis and encephalitis. The inclusion of a TOSV genome target may improve the laboratory diagnosis of viral neurological infections in endemic areas."

Epub 2015 Nov 24.,Macchi F,J Neurosci Methods,2016,2015/12/02,,,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.11.009,"BACKGROUND: Alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) aggregates represent a key feature of Parkinson's disease, but the exact relationship between α-SYN aggregation and neurodegeneration remains incompletely understood. Therefore, the availability of a cellular assay that allows medium-throughput analysis of α-SYN-linked pathology will be of great value for studying the aggregation process and for advancing α-SYN-based therapies.
NEW METHOD: Here we describe a high-content neuronal cell assay that simultaneously measures oxidative stress-induced α-SYN aggregation and apoptosis.
RESULTS: We optimized an automated and reproducible assay to quantify both α-SYN aggregation and cell death in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Quantification of α-SYN aggregates in cells has typically relied on manual imaging and counting or cell-free assays, which are time consuming and do not allow a concurrent analysis of cell viability. Our high-content analysis method for quantification of α-SYN aggregation allows simultaneous measurements of multiple cell parameters at a single-cell level in a fast, objective and automated manner.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented analysis approach offers a rapid, objective and multiparametric approach for the screening of compounds and genes that might alter α-SYN aggregation and/or toxicity."

Women with less TDLU involution are more likely to develop breast cancer. A major bottleneck in studying TDLU involution in large cohort studies is the need for labor-intensive manual assessment of TDLUs. We developed a computational pathology solution to automatically capture TDLU involution measures. Whole slide images (WSIs) of benign breast biopsies were obtained from the Nurses' Health Study. A set of 92 WSIs was annotated for acini, TDLUs and adipose tissue to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for detection of acini, and segmentation of TDLUs and adipose tissue. These networks were integrated into a single computational method to capture TDLU involution measures including number of TDLUs per tissue area, median TDLU span and median number of acini per TDLU. We validated our method on 40 additional WSIs by comparing with manually acquired measures. Our CNN models detected acini with an F1 score of 0.73±0.07, and segmented TDLUs and adipose tissue with Dice scores of 0.84±0.13 and 0.87±0.04, respectively. The inter-observer ICC scores for manual assessments on 40 WSIs of number of TDLUs per tissue area, median TDLU span, and median acini count per TDLU were 0.71, 0.81 and 0.73, respectively. Intra-observer reliability was evaluated on 10/40 WSIs with ICC scores of >0.8. Inter-observer ICC scores between automated results and the mean of the two observers were: 0.80 for number of TDLUs per tissue area, 0.57 for median TDLU span, and 0.80 for median acini count per TDLU. TDLU involution measures evaluated by manual and automated assessment were inversely associated with age and menopausal status. We developed a computational pathology method to measure TDLU involution. This technology eliminates the labor-intensiveness and subjectivity of manual TDLU assessment, and can be applied to future breast cancer risk studies."

The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance.
METHODS: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T.
RESULTS: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99) and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation algorithms."

Whether the pandemic has affected OHCA outcomes more broadly is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and OHCA outcomes, including in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 disease burden.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a large US registry of OHCAs to compare outcomes during the pandemic period of March 16 through April 30, 2020, with those from March 16 through April 30, 2019. Cases were geocoded to US counties, and the COVID-19 mortality rate in each county was categorized as very low (0-25 per million residents), low (26-100 per million residents), moderate (101-250 per million residents), high (251-500 per million residents), or very high (>500 per million residents). As additional controls, the study compared OHCA outcomes during the prepandemic period (January through February) and peripandemic period (March 1 through 15).
EXPOSURE: The COVID-19 pandemic.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sustained ROSC (≥20 minutes), survival to discharge, and OHCA incidence.
RESULTS: A total of 19 303 OHCAs occurred from March 16 through April 30 in both years, with 9863 cases in 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.6 [19.3] years; 6040 men [61.3%]) and 9440 in 2019 (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [19.2] years; 5922 men [62.7%]). During the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC were lower than in 2019 (23.0% vs 29.8%; adjusted rate ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87]; P < .001). Sustained ROSC rates were lower by between 21% (286 of 1429 [20.0%] in 2020 vs 305 of 1130 [27.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.97]) and 33% (149 of 863 [17.3%] in 2020 vs 192 of 667 [28.8%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.56-0.80]) in communities with high or very high COVID-19 mortality, respectively; however, rates of sustained ROSC were also lower by 11% (583 of 2317 [25.2%] in 2020 vs 740 of 2549 [29.0%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.98]) to 15% (889 of 3495 [25.4%] in 2020 vs 1109 of 3532 [31.4%] in 2019; adjusted RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.93]) in communities with very low and low COVID-19 mortality. Among emergency medical services agencies with complete data on hospital survival (7085 total patients), survival to discharge was lower during the pandemic compared with 2019 (6.6% vs 9.8%; adjusted RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.69-1.00]; P = .048), primarily in communities with moderate to very high COVID-19 mortality (interaction P = .049). Incidence of OHCA was higher than in 2019, but the increase was largely observed in communities with high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 38.6 [95% CI, 37.1-40.1] per million residents) and very high COVID-19 mortality (adjusted mean difference, 28.7 [95% CI, 26.7-30.6] per million residents). In contrast, there was no difference in rates of sustained ROSC or survival to discharge during the prepandemic and peripandemic periods in 2020 vs 2019.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early during the pandemic, rates of sustained ROSC for OHCA were lower throughout the US, even in communities with low COVID-19 mortality rates. Overall survival was lower, primarily in communities with moderate or high COVID-19 mortality."

METHODS: We applied tract-based spatial statistics for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. First, we compared fractional anisotropy (FA) between 20 OCD patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Then, applying whole brain analysis, we searched the brain regions showing correlations between the severities of symptom dimensions assessed by Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and FA in all participants. Finally, we calculated the correlations between the six symptom dimensions and multiple DTI measures [FA, axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD)] in a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and explored the differences between OCD patients and HC.
RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in FA or brain region correlations between the severities of symptom dimensions and FA in any of the participants. ROI analysis revealed negative correlations between checking severity and left inferior frontal gyrus white matter and left middle temporal gyrus white matter and a positive correlation between ordering severity and right precuneus in FA in OCD compared with HC. We also found negative correlations between ordering severity and right precuneus in RD, between obsessing severities and right supramarginal gyrus in AD and MD, and between hoarding severity and right insular gyrus in AD.
CONCLUSION: Our study supported the hypothesis that the severities of respective symptom dimensions are associated with different patterns of white matter alterations."

The US Nutrition5k project provides for ~5000 dish images and related dish- and ingredient-level information on mass, energy, and macronutrients from the US FCDB. The aim of this study is to (1) identify challenges/solutions in linking the nutritional composition of Italian foods with food images from Nutrition5k and (2) assess potential differences in nutrient content estimated across the Italian and US FCDBs and their determinants.
METHODS: After food matching, expert data curation, and handling of missing values, dish-level ingredients from Nutrition5k were integrated with the Italian-FCDB-specific nutritional composition (86 components); dish-specific nutrient content was calculated by summing the corresponding ingredient-specific nutritional values. Measures of agreement/difference were calculated between Italian- and US-FCDB-specific content of energy and macronutrients. Potential determinants of identified differences were investigated with multiple robust regression models.
RESULTS: Dishes showed a median mass of 145 g and included three ingredients in median. Energy, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates showed moderate-to-strong agreement between Italian- and US-FCDB-specific content; carbohydrates showed the worst performance, with the Italian FCDB providing smaller median values (median raw difference between the Italian and US FCDBs: -2.10 g). Regression models on dishes suggested a role for mass, number of ingredients, and presence of recreated recipes, alone or jointly with differential use of raw/cooked ingredients across the two FCDBs.
CONCLUSIONS: In the era of machine learning approaches for food image recognition, manual data curation in the alignment of FCDBs is worth the effort."

Today, a range of treatments is available for directed therapy, mostly targeting the overactive immune response. However, the mechanisms by which the immune system contributes to disease pathogenesis and progression are not fully understood. One challenge hindering IBD research is the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the lack of understanding of how immune cells interact with one another in the gut mucosa. Introduction of a technology that enables expansive characterization of the inflammatory environment of human IBD tissues may address this gap in knowledge.
METHODS: We used the imaging mass cytometry platform to perform highly multiplex image analysis of IBD and healthy deidentified intestine sections (6 Crohn's disease compared to 6 control ileum; 6 ulcerative colitis compared to 6 control colon). The acquired images were graded for inflammation severity by analysis of adjacent H&E tissue sections. We assigned more than 300,000 cells to unique cell types and performed analyses of tissue integrity, epithelial activity, and immune cell composition.
RESULTS: The intestinal epithelia of patients with IBD exhibited increased proliferation rates and expression of HLA-DR compared to control tissues, and both features were positively correlated with the severity of inflammation. The neighborhood analysis determined enrichment of regulatory T cell interactions with CD68+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and plasma cells in both forms of IBD, whereas activated lysozyme C+ macrophages were preferred regulatory T cell neighbors in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study shows the power of imaging mass cytometry and its ability to both quantify immune cell types and characterize their spatial interactions within the inflammatory environment by a single analysis platform."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, a total of 80 patients (training cohort: 63 patients from three hospitals; validation cohort: 17 patients from three other hospitals) with osteosarcoma, undergoing pretreatment CT between August 2010 and December 2018, were identified from multicenter databases. Radiomics features were extracted and selected from tumor regions on CT image, and then, the radiomics signature was constructed. The radiomics nomogram that incorporated the radiomics signature and clinical-based risk factors was developed to predict relapse risk with a multivariate Cox regression model using the training cohort and validated using the external validation cohort. The performance of the nomogram was assessed concerning discrimination, calibration, reclassification, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier curves based on the radiomics signature showed a significant difference between the high-risk and the low-risk groups in both training and validation cohorts (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively). The radiomics nomogram achieved good discriminant results in the training cohort (C-index: 0.779) and the validation cohort (C-index: 0.710) as well as good calibration. Decision curve analysis revealed that the proposed model significantly improved the clinical benefit compared with the clinical-based nomogram (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study demonstrates that a radiomics nomogram incorporated the radiomics signature and clinical-based risk factors can increase the predictive value of the osteosarcoma relapse risk, which supports the clinical application in different institutions."
29861348,Using synthetic CT for partial brain radiation therapy: Impact on image guidance,"Morris ED, Price RG, Kim J, Schultz L, Siddiqui MS, Chetty I, Glide-Hurst C.",Pract Radiat Oncol. 2018 Sep-Oct;8(5):342-350. doi: 10.1016/j.prro.2018.04.001. Epub 2018 Apr 6.,Morris ED,Pract Radiat Oncol,2018,2018/06/05,PMC6123249,NIHMS972292,10.1016/j.prro.2018.04.001,"PURPOSE: Recent advancements in synthetic computed tomography (synCT) from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data have made MRI-only treatment planning feasible in the brain, although synCT performance for image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is not well understood. This work compares geometric equivalence of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CTs and synCTs for brain cancer patients and quantifies performance for partial brain IGRT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten brain cancer patients (12 lesions, 7 postsurgical) underwent MR-SIM and CT-SIM. SynCTs were generated by combining ultra-short echo time, T1, T2, and fluid attenuation inversion recovery datasets using voxel-based weighted summation. SynCT and CT DRRs were compared using patient-specific thresholding and assessed via overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index. Planar IGRT images for 22 fractions were evaluated to quantify differences between CT-generated DRRs and synCT-generated DRRs in 6 quadrants. Previously validated software was implemented to perform 2-dimensional (2D)-2D rigid registrations using normalized mutual information. Absolute (planar image/DRR registration) and relative (differences between synCT and CT DRR registrations) shifts were calculated for each axis and 3-dimensional vector difference. A total of 1490 rigid registrations were assessed.
RESULTS: DRR agreements in anteroposterior and lateral views for overlap index, Dice similarity coefficient, and Jaccard index were >0.95. Normalized mutual information results were equivalent in 75% of quadrants. Rotational registration results were negligible (<0.07°). Statistically significant differences between CT and synCT registrations were observed in 9/18 matched quadrants/axes (P < .05). The population average absolute shifts were 0.77 ± 0.58 and 0.76 ± 0.59 mm for CT and synCT, respectively, for all axes/quadrants. Three-dimensional vectors were <2 mm in 77.7 ± 10.8% and 76.5 ± 7.2% of CT and synCT registrations, respectively. SynCT DRRs were sensitive in postsurgical cases (vector displacements >2 mm in affected quadrants).
CONCLUSIONS: DRR synCT geometry was robust. Although statistically significant differences were observed between CT and synCT registrations, results were not clinically significant. Future work will address synCT generation in postsurgical settings."

The significant biological and technical variance between samples in cytometry has long posed a formidable challenge during the gating process, especially for the initial gates which deal with unpredictable events, such as debris and technical artifacts. Even with the same experimental machine and protocol, the target population, as well as the cell population that needs to be excluded, may vary across different measurements. To address this challenge and mitigate the labor-intensive manual gating process, we propose a deep learning framework UNITO to rigorously identify the hierarchical cytometric subpopulations. The UNITO framework transformed a cell-level classification task into an image-based semantic segmentation problem. For reproducibility purposes, the framework was applied to three independent cohorts and successfully detected initial gates that were required to identify single cellular events as well as subsequent cell gates. We validated the UNITO framework by comparing its results with previous automated methods and the consensus of at least four experienced immunologists. UNITO outperformed existing automated methods and differed from human consensus by no more than each individual human. Most critically, UNITO framework functions as a fully automated pipeline after training and does not require human hints or prior knowledge. Unlike existing multi-channel classification or clustering pipelines, UNITO can reproduce a similar contour compared to manual gating for each intermediate gating to achieve better interpretability and provide post hoc visual inspection. Beyond acting as a pioneering framework that uses image segmentation to do auto-gating, UNITO gives a fast and interpretable way to assign the cell subtype membership, and the speed of UNITO will not be impacted by the number of cells from each sample. The pre-gating and gating inference takes approximately 2 minutes for each sample using our pre-defined 9 gates system, and it can also adapt to any sequential prediction with different configurations."

Epub 2019 Mar 16.,Kumar S,Comput Biol Med,2019,2019/04/26,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.03.002,"Vascular dementia is a serious problem as it creates significant disability and dependency in the affected person. Lives of these patients can be improved through the advent of novel drug targets which can be targeted by pharmacological therapies. However, finding a precise and druggable target for vascular dementia is experimentally impossible and challenging task owing to a complex and mostly unknown interplay between the cognitive abilities of the brain with a diversity of vascular diseases. To address this issue, we have systematically analyzed the literature reports by using well-known methods and approaches of bioinformatics (viz. network pharmacology, reverse pharmacology, enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways, biological processes of Gene Ontology and DIAMOnD algorithm). Because glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) seems to be one of the most promising targets, therefore, we have tested the capacity of lithium carbonate, a classical inhibitor of GSK-3, for treatment of dementia resulting from mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in mice. To this end, our study shows in-vivo validation of predicted target, i.e., pharmacological deactivation of GSK-3 enzyme and its impact on cognitive abilities employing a behavioral test battery, i.e., object recognition task, step-through passive avoidance task, elevated plus maze task and water maze task. In this framework, we observed that lithium carbonate attenuates recognition, emotion, spatial and fear-motivated learning and memory impairments along with attenuation of oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, we propose GSK-3 as a promising drug target for vascular dementia in light of experimental results and in-silico predictions."

Based on the hypothesis that asynchronous plaque motion is associated with vulnerable plaque, in this study, synchronisation patterns of different tissue areas were estimated using cross-correlations of displacement waveforms. In 135 plaques (77 subjects), plaque radial deformation was synchronised by approximately 50% with the arterial diameter, and the mean phase shift was 0.4 s. Within the plaque, the mean phase shifts between the displacements of the top and bottom surfaces were 0.2 s and 0.3 s, in the radial and longitudinal directions, respectively, and the synchronisation about 80% in both directions. Classification of phase-shift-based features using Random Forests yielded Area-Under-the-Curve scores of 0.81, 0.79, 0.89 and 0.90 for echogenicity, symptomaticity, stenosis degree and plaque risk, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that echolucent, high-stenosis and high-risk plaques exhibited higher phase shifts between the radial displacements of their top and bottom surfaces. These findings are useful in the study of plaque kinematics."

The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of the FUIP for EwS patients regarding survival after relapse.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter analysis on 160 eligible patients with EwS recurrence was performed. Potential survival differences following recurrence diagnosis between patients with protocol-detected and symptomatic relapse were investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additional subgroup analyses were performed on the relapse type. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from diagnosis of relapse to last follow-up or death.
RESULTS: In the multicenter analysis, recurrence was detected by FUIP in 77 of 160 patients (48%) and due to symptoms in 83 patients (52%). Regarding the entire study population, OS was significantly superior in patients with protocol-detected relapse compared to patients with symptomatic relapse (median, 2.4 vs. 1.2 years; P < 0.001). In the subgroup analyses, patients whose lung recurrences were detected by the FUIP experienced longer survival after recurrence than those whose recurrences were detected symptomatically (P = 0.023). In the 83 symptomatic patients, pain was the most prevalent symptom of relapse (72%).
CONCLUSION: FUIP may benefit survival in EwS relapse, especially in lung recurrence. Pain was the leading symptom of relapse."

The aim of this study was to examine whether an age-related influence on joint mobility can be detected in the absence of disease. Five young (mean age 2.0 years) and five old (mean age 10.4 years) healthy and sound Beagle dogs underwent computer-assisted gait analysis during locomotion on a treadmill. Shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle, and tarsal joint angles including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles, and range of motion (ROM) in degrees were analyzed. The old group had a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint; there were similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow, and carpal joints. Descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the forelimb joints. The results indicate restricted joint mobility of the forelimb in old dogs, primarily of the carpal joint. Results in the joints of the hindlimb were inconsistent, and the contrasting alterations may be due to a compensatory mechanism. As most alterations were found in the distal joints, these should receive particular attention when examining elderly dogs."

With the lack of a single factor with great reliability to preoperatively predict AHS, we developed a computational approach by integrating large-scale imaging factors, especially radiomic features at contrast-enhanced computed tomography, to predict AHS and clinical outcomes of patients with GC.
METHODS: Five hundred fifty-four patients with GC (370 training and 184 test) undergoing gastrectomy were retrospectively included. Six radiomic scores (R-scores) related to pT stage, pN stage, Lauren & Borrmann (L&B) classification, World Health Organization grade, lymphatic vascular infiltration, and an overall histopathologic score (H-score) were, respectively, built from 7,000+ radiomic features. R-scores and radiographic factors were then integrated into prediction models to assess AHS. The developed AHS-based Cox model was compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth stage model for predicting survival outcomes.
RESULTS: Radiomics related to tumor gray-level intensity, size, and inhomogeneity were top-ranked features for AHS. R-scores constructed from those features reflected significant difference between AHS-absent and AHS-present groups (P < 0.001). Regression analysis identified 5 independent predictors for pT and pN stages, 2 predictors for Lauren & Borrmann classification, World Health Organization grade, and lymphatic vascular infiltration, and 3 predictors for H-score, respectively. Area under the curve of models using those predictors was training/test 0.93/0.94, 0.85/0.83, 0.63/0.59, 0.66/0.63, 0.71/0.69, and 0.84/0.77, respectively. The AHS-based Cox model produced higher area under the curve than the eighth AJCC staging model for predicting survival outcomes. Furthermore, adding AHS-based scores to the eighth AJCC staging model enabled better net benefits for disease outcome stratification.
DISCUSSION: The developed computational approach demonstrates good performance for successfully decoding AHS of GC and preoperatively predicting disease clinical outcomes."

METHODS: In the prospective observational cohort Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study of 1066 adults with type 2 diabetes, aged 60-75 years at recruitment, 718 were free from diabetic retinopathy at baseline. Baseline retinal traits including vessel widths, tortuosity (curvature) and fractal dimensions (network complexity), were quantified using fundus camera images and semiautomated software, and analysed using logistic regression for their association with incident diabetic retinopathy over 10 years.
RESULTS: The incidence of diabetic retinopathy was 11.4% (n = 82) over 10 years. After adjustment for a range of vascular and diabetes-related risk factors, both increased venular tortuosity (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.15, 1.98; p = 0.003) and decreased fractal dimension (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58, 0.96; p = 0.025) were associated with incident retinopathy. There was no evidence of an association with arterial tortuosity, and associations between measurements of vessel widths and retinopathy lost statistical significance after adjustment for diabetes-related factors and vascular disease. Adding venular tortuosity to a model including established risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, BP and kidney function) improved the discriminative ability (C statistic increased from 0.624 to 0.640, p = 0.013), but no such benefit was found with fractal dimension.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased retinal venular tortuosity and decreased fractal dimension are associated with incident diabetic retinopathy, independent of classical risk factors. There is some evidence that venular tortuosity may be a useful biomarker to improve the predictive ability of models based on established retinopathy risk factors, and its inclusion in further risk prediction modelling is warranted."

We introduce a novel method for objective evaluation of fMRI scan quality, based on activation maps. A template matching analysis (TMA) is presented and tested on data from two clinical fMRI protocols, performed by healthy controls in seven clinical centers. Preliminary clinical utility is tested with data from low-grade glioma patients.
METHODS: Data were collected from 42 healthy subjects from seven centers, with standardized finger tapping (FT) and verb generation (VG) tasks. Copies of these ""typical"" data were deliberately analyzed incorrectly to assess feasibility of identifying them as ""atypical."" Analyses of the VG task administered to 32 tumor patients assessed sensitivity of the TMA method to anatomical abnormalities.
RESULTS: TMA identified all atypical activity maps for both tasks, at the cost of incorrectly classifying 3.6 (VG)-6.5% (FT) of typical maps as atypical. For patients, the average TMA was significantly higher than atypical healthy scans, despite localized anatomical abnormalities caused by a tumor.
CONCLUSION: This study supports feasibility of TMA for objective identification of atypical activation patterns for motor and verb generation fMRI protocols. TMA can facilitate the use and evaluation of clinical fMRI in hospital settings that have limited access to fMRI experts. In a clinical setting, this method could be applied to automatically flag fMRI scans showing atypical activation patterns for further investigation to determine whether atypicality is caused by poor scan data quality or abnormal functional topography."

These risk assessments should be supported and supplemented by objective methods for identifying patients at increased risk of recurrence. Markers of epigenetic aberrations have shown promising results in several cancer types and can be assessed by automatic analysis of chromatin organisation in tumour cell nuclei.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 317 prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy at a national hospital between 1987 and 2005 were followed for a median of 10 years (interquartile range, 7-14). On average three tumour block samples from each patient were included to account for tumour heterogeneity. We developed a novel marker, termed Nucleotyping, based on automatic assessment of disordered chromatin organisation, and validated its ability to predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
RESULTS: Nucleotyping predicted recurrence with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1-5.1). With adjustment for clinical and pathological characteristics, the HR was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.5-4.1). An updated stratification into three risk groups significantly improved the concordance with patient outcome compared with a state-of-the-art risk-stratification tool (P<0.001). The prognostic impact was most evident for the patients who were high-risk by clinical and pathological characteristics and for patients with Gleason score 7.
CONCLUSION: A novel assessment of epigenetic aberrations was capable of improving risk stratification after radical prostatectomy."

Materials and Methods This was a retrospective, institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant study. Two hundred seventy-eight women from 25 to 76 years of age with increased breast cancer risk who underwent CE spectral mammography and MR imaging for screening or staging from 2010 through 2014 were included. Three readers independently rated BPE on CE spectral mammographic and MR images with the ordinal scale: minimal, mild, moderate, or marked. To assess pairwise agreement between BPE levels on CE spectral mammographic and MR images and among readers, weighted κ coefficients with quadratic weights were calculated. For overall agreement, mean κ values and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The univariate and multivariate associations between BPE and clinical factors were examined by using generalized estimating equations separately for CE spectral mammography and MR imaging. Results Most women had minimal or mild BPE at both CE spectral mammography (68%-76%) and MR imaging (69%-76%). Between CE spectral mammography and MR imaging, the intrareader agreement ranged from moderate to substantial (κ = 0.55-0.67). Overall agreement on BPE levels between CE spectral mammography and MR imaging and among readers was substantial (κ = 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.70). With both modalities, BPE demonstrated significant association with menopausal status, prior breast radiation therapy, hormonal treatment, breast density on CE spectral mammographic images, and amount of fibroglandular tissue on MR images (P &lt; .001 for all). Conclusion There was substantial agreement between readers for BPE detected on CE spectral mammographic and MR images. © RSNA, 2016."

Epub 2018 Jun 29.,Morioka T,Breast Cancer,2018,2018/07/01,,,10.1007/s12282-018-0885-1,"BACKGROUND: Routine analysis of Ki-67 is not widely recommended for clinical decision-making because of poor reproducibility. Furthermore, counting numerous cells can be laborious for pathologists. Digital image analysis for immunohistochemical analysis was recently developed; however, the clinical efficacy of the Ki-67 index obtained using image analysis is unknown.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified female patients with breast cancer with immunohistochemical Ki-67 and survival data using the pathology database at the Tokai University, Japan. Ki-67 expression was scored by three pathologists. Slides were scanned and converted to virtual slides; Ki-67-positive cells were counted using image analysis. Ki-67 indices obtained by the pathologist's scoring and image analysis were evaluated by 2 × 2 analysis. Relationships between Ki-67 index and survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: Based on the 2 × 2 analysis, Ki-67 index obtained using image analysis was moderately correlated with the pathologist's scoring for all patients (κ 0.41; sensitivity, 0.573; specificity, 0.878). Poorer relapse-free survival was associated with high Ki-67 index than with low Ki-67 index for estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and stage I or II patients scored by pathologists (p < 0.001) and obtained using image analysis (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: The Ki-67 indices obtained using image analysis were moderately correlated with those scored by pathologists. Digital image analysis can be effective for measuring Ki-67 values, because they are associated with relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and patients at stage I or II."

OBJECTIVE: We examined the clinical utility of MSmetrix and investigated if automated MRI volumes could discriminate between groups covering the AD continuum and could be used as a predictor for clinical progression.
METHODS: The Belgian Dementia Council initiated a retrospective, multi-center study and analyzed whole brain (WB), grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical GM (CGM) volumes, and WM hyperintensities (WMH) using MSmetrix in the AD continuum. Baseline (n = 887) and follow-up (FU, n = 95) T1-weighted brain MRIs and time-linked neuropsychological data were available.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of cognitively healthy controls (HC, n = 93), subjective cognitive decline (n = 102), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 379), and AD dementia (n = 313). Baseline WB and GM volumes could accurately discriminate between clinical diagnostic groups and were significantly decreased with increasing cognitive impairment. MCI patients had a significantly larger change in WB, GM, and CGM volumes based on two MRIs (n = 95) compared to HC (FU>24months, p = 0.020). Linear regression models showed that baseline atrophy of WB, GM, CGM, and increased CSF volumes predicted cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: WB and GM volumes extracted by MSmetrix could be used to define the clinical spectrum of AD accurately and along with CGM, they are able to predict cognitive impairment based on (decline in) MMSE scores. Therefore, MSmetrix can support clinicians in their diagnostic decisions, is able to detect clinical disease progression, and is of help to stratify populations for clinical trials."

We compared two computational pathology platforms on their measurement of breast tumour oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression.
METHODS: Breast tumour microarrays from the Nurses' Health Study were stained for ER (n=592) and PR (n=187). One expert pathologist scored cases as positive if ≥1% of tumour nuclei exhibited stain. ER and PR were then measured with the Definiens Tissue Studio (automated) and Aperio Digital Pathology (user-supervised) platforms. Platform-specific measurements were compared using boxplots, scatter plots and correlation statistics. Classification of ER and PR positivity by platform-specific measurements was evaluated with areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) from univariable logistic regression models, using expert pathologist classification as the standard.
RESULTS: Both platforms showed considerable overlap in continuous measurements of ER and PR between positive and negative groups classified by expert pathologist. Platform-specific measurements were strongly and positively correlated with one another (r≥0.77). The user-supervised Aperio workflow performed slightly better than the automated Definiens workflow at classifying ER positivity (AUC<sub>Aperio</sub>=0.97; AUC<sub>Definiens</sub>=0.90; difference=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09) and PR positivity (AUC<sub>Aperio</sub>=0.94; AUC<sub>Definiens</sub>=0.87; difference=0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Paired hormone receptor expression measurements from two different computational pathology platforms agreed well with one another. The user-supervised workflow yielded better classification accuracy than the automated workflow. Appropriately validated computational pathology algorithms enrich molecular epidemiology studies with continuous protein expression data and may accelerate tumour biomarker discovery."

Epub 2016 Oct 26.,Shah R,Am Heart J,2017,2016/11/29,PMC5785086,NIHMS859280,10.1016/j.ahj.2016.10.014,"BACKGROUND: The outcomes in patients by visual assessment and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) are not known. Our objectives were to compare visual and QCA estimates of obstructive CAD and to assess their relationship to outcomes in stable patients with symptoms of CAD.
METHODS: The PROMISE trial randomized 10,003 patients with CAD symptoms to anatomical or functional testing. Site reports of invasive angiography detailing visual stenosis and independent, blinded QCA were performed for obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis). Disagreement between methods was determined and compared with outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, or major procedural complications).
RESULTS: Of 929 patients (9.3% of PROMISE cohort) with angiograms assessed by sites and QCA, 593 (64%) had obstructive CAD per site reports, whereas 428 (46%) had stenosis ≥50% per QCA. Results differed in 177 patients (disagreement rate 19.1%, κ=0.63), of whom 171 had CAD per sites but not per QCA. One-year unadjusted Kaplan-Meier event rates were highest (5.1%) when QCA and visual assessment agreed for CAD, lowest (0.9%) when the 2 agreed for no obstructive CAD, and intermediate (3.1%) for patients who had CAD per visual assessment but not per QCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Visual estimation of angiograms results in more frequent diagnosis of obstructive CAD as compared with QCA. Concordance of results for presence or absence of obstructive CAD was associated with high and low event rates, respectively. Disagreement was associated with intermediate event rates, suggesting that cardiologists integrated clinical information into routine visual assessment of angiograms."

DESIGN: Reliability analysis.
METHODS: ROP experts were recruited in 2007 and 2016 to classify 34 wide-field fundus images of ROP as plus, pre-plus, or normal, coded as ""3,"" ""2,"" and ""1,"" respectively, in the database. The main outcome was the average calculated score for each image in each cohort. Secondary outcomes included correlation on the relative ordering of the images in 2016 vs 2007, interexpert agreement, and intraexpert agreement.
RESULTS: The average score for each image was higher for 30 of 34 (88%) images in 2016 compared with 2007, influenced by fewer images classified as normal (P < .01), a similar number of pre-plus (P = .52), and more classified as plus (P < .01). The mean weighted kappa values in 2006 were 0.36 (range 0.21-0.60), compared with 0.22 (range 0-0.40) in 2016. There was good correlation between rankings of disease severity between the 2 cohorts (Spearman rank correlation ρ = 0.94), indicating near-perfect agreement on relative disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite good agreement between cohorts on relative disease severity ranking, the higher average score and classifications for each image demonstrate that experts are diagnosing pre-plus and plus disease at earlier stages of disease severity in 2016, compared with 2007. This has implications for patient care, research, and teaching, and additional studies are needed to better understand this temporal trend in image-based plus disease diagnosis."

Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening offers an opportunity for simultaneous CVD risk estimation in at-risk patients. Our deep learning CVD risk prediction model, trained with 30,286 LDCTs from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.871 on a separate test set of 2,085 subjects and identifies patients with high CVD mortality risks (AUC of 0.768). We validate our model against ECG-gated cardiac CT based markers, including coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, CAD-RADS score, and MESA 10-year risk score from an independent dataset of 335 subjects. Our work shows that, in high-risk patients, deep learning can convert LDCT for lung cancer screening into a dual-screening quantitative tool for CVD risk estimation."

METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of 806 free flaps (1979 to 2016); 481 soft-tissue flaps performed for below-knee trauma met inclusion criteria. Primary outcome measures were perioperative complications, specifically, take-backs and flap salvage rates. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed where appropriate.
RESULTS: Take-backs occurred in 71 flaps (muscle, n = 44; fasciocutaneous, n = 27) at an average of 3.7 ± 5.4 days postoperatively. Indications were venous (48 percent), arterial (31 percent), unknown (10 percent), and hematoma (10 percent). Overall outcomes were complete salvage (37 percent), partial failure (25 percent), and total failure (38 percent). Take-backs occurring within 48 hours postoperatively correlated with higher salvage rates (p = 0.022). Fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated increased take-back rates compared with muscle flaps (p = 0.005) that more frequently occurred within 48 hours postoperatively (relative risk, 13.2; p = 0.012). Fasciocutaneous flaps were successfully salvaged more often than muscle-based flaps (p < 0.001). Multivariable regression strongly demonstrated higher risk of take-back failure for muscle flaps (relative risk, 9.42; p = 0.001), despite higher take-back rates among fasciocutaneous flaps (relative risk, 2.28; p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with muscle-based flaps, fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated earlier and more frequent take-backs for suspected vascular compromise, with higher successful take-back salvage rates. Furthermore, muscle flaps with skin paddles also demonstrated better salvage outcomes than those without. These findings may reflect a combination of lower metabolic demand and easier visual recognition of vascular compromise in fasciocutaneous tissue.

OBJECTIVE: Deep learning models such as SpineNet offer the possibility of automating the process of disk degeneration (DD) classification from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). External validation is an essential step to their development. The aim of this study was to externally validate SpineNet predictions for DD using Pfirrmann classification and Modic changes (MCs) on data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966).
SUMMARY OF DATA: We validated SpineNet using data from 1331 NFBC1966 participants for whom both lumbar spine MRI data and consensus DD gradings were available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SpineNet returned Pfirrmann grade and MC presence from T2-weighted sagittal lumbar MRI sequences from NFBC1966, a data set geographically and temporally separated from its training data set. A range of agreement and reliability metrics were used to compare predictions with expert radiologists. Subsets of data that match SpineNet training data more closely were also tested.
RESULTS: Balanced accuracy for DD was 78% (77%-79%) and for MC 86% (85%-86%). Interrater reliability for Pfirrmann grading was Lin concordance correlation coefficient=0.86 (0.85-0.87) and Cohen κ=0.68 (0.67-0.69). In a low back pain subset, these reliability metrics remained largely unchanged. In total, 20.83% of disks were rated differently by SpineNet compared with the human raters, but only 0.85% of disks had a grade difference >1. Interrater reliability for MC detection was κ=0.74 (0.72-0.75). In the low back pain subset, this metric was almost unchanged at κ=0.76 (0.73-0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, SpineNet has been benchmarked against expert human raters in the research setting. It has matched human reliability and demonstrates robust performance despite the multiple challenges facing model generalizability."

However, accurate, efficient, and replicable models of quantifying adiposity have yet to be developed and clinically implemented. We propose a novel semiautomated radiologic method of measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) using computed tomography scan analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained a cohort of 100 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, with a median age of 60.9 y (age range: 35-87 y) and an average body mass index of 28.8 kg/m2 ± 6.56 kg/m2. The semiautomated quantification method of adiposity was developed using a commercial imaging suite. The method was compared to two manual delineations performed using two different picture archiving communication systems. We quantified VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), total fat area (TFA), and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V/S ratio) on computed tomography axial slices that were at the L4-L5 intervertebral level.
RESULTS: The semiautomated method was comparable to manual measurements for TFA, VFA, and SFA with intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. However, the ICC for the V/S ratio was only 0.44, which led to the identification of technical outliers that were identified using robust regression. After removal of these outliers, the ICC improved to 0.99 for TFA, VFA, and SFA and 0.97 for the V/S ratio. Measurements from the manual methodology highly correlated between the two picture archiving communication system platforms, with ICC of 0.98 for TFA, 0.98 for VFA, 0.96 for SFA, and 0.95 for the V/S ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: This semiautomated method is able to generate precise and reproducible results. In the future, this method may be applied on a larger scale to facilitate risk stratification of patients using measures of abdominal adiposity."

Here, we assessed the reliability of the automated segmentation of amygdalar nuclei and hippocampal subfields across sites and vendors using FreeSurfer in two independent cohorts of older and younger healthy adults.
METHODS: Sixty-five healthy older (cohort 1) and 68 younger subjects (cohort 2), from the PharmaCog and CoRR consortia, underwent repeated 3D-T1 MRI (interval 1-90 days). Segmentation was performed using FreeSurfer v6.0. Reliability was assessed using volume reproducibility error (ε) and spatial overlapping coefficient (DICE) between test and retest session.
RESULTS: Significant MRI site and vendor effects (p ​&lt; ​.05) were found in a few subfields/nuclei for the ε, while extensive effects were found for the DICE score of most subfields/nuclei. Reliability was strongly influenced by volume, as ε correlated negatively and DICE correlated positively with volume size of structures (absolute value of Spearman's r correlations &gt;0.43, p ​&lt; ​1.39E-36). In particular, volumes larger than 200 ​mm3 (for amygdalar nuclei) and 300 ​mm3 (for hippocampal subfields, except for molecular layer) had the best test-retest reproducibility (ε ​&lt; ​5% and DICE ​&gt; ​0.80).
CONCLUSION: Our results support the use of volumetric measures of larger amygdalar nuclei and hippocampal subfields in multisite MRI studies. These measures could be useful for disease tracking and assessment of efficacy in drug trials."

Purpose To integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation for multiple structures, coronary artery calcium (CAC), and epicardial adipose tissue with automated feature extraction methods and machine learning to detect extrapulmonary abnormalities and predict all-cause mortality (ACM) in a large multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods In this post hoc analysis, baseline chest CT scans in patients enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) from August 2002 to September 2007 were included from 33 participating sites. Per scan, 32 structures were segmented with a multistructure model. For each structure, 15 clinically interpretable radiomic features were quantified. Four general codes describing abnormalities reported by NLST radiologists were applied to identify extrapulmonary significant incidental findings on the CT scans. Death at 2-year and 10-year follow-up and the presence of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were predicted with ensemble AI models, and individualized structure risk scores were evaluated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the models for prediction of ACM and extrapulmonary significant incidental findings. The Pearson χ2 test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results A total of 24 401 participants (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 14 468 male) were included. In 3880 of 24 401 participants (16%), 4283 extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were reported. During the 10-year follow-up, 3389 of 24 401 participants (14%) died. CAC had the highest feature importance for predicting the three study end points. The 10-year ACM model demonstrated the best AUC performance (0.72; per-year mortality of 2.6% above and 0.8% below the risk threshold), followed by 2-year ACM (0.71; per-year mortality of 1.13% above and 0.3% below the risk threshold) and prediction of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings (0.70; probability of occurrence of 25.4% above and 9.6% below the threshold). Conclusion A fully automated AI model indicated extrapulmonary structures at risk on chest CT scans and predicted ACM with explanations.

This nationwide, multi-institutional study aims to clarify the cancer risk by length of BE in the general Japanese population.
METHODS: Consecutive subjects who underwent upper endoscopic screening at 17 centers between 2013 and 2017 and had at least one follow-up endoscopy by December 2022 were included. The presence/absence of BE and, if present, its length were retrospectively assessed using the retrieved endoscopic images recorded at baseline. Information on the subsequent occurrence of esophageal adenocarcinoma and other upper gastrointestinal cancers was also collected. Cancer incidence was calculated and expressed as %/year.
RESULTS: A total of 33,478 subjects were enrolled, and 17,884 (53.4%), 10,641 (31.8%), 4889 (14.6%), and 64 (0.2%) were diagnosed as absent BE, BE < 1 cm, 1-3 cm, and ≥ 3 cm, respectively. During a median follow-up of 80 months, 11 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma developed. The annual incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is 0%/year for absent BE, 0.0032 (0.00066-0.013)%/year for BE < 1 cm, 0.026 (0.011-0.054)%/year for 1-3 cm, and 0.58 (0.042-2.11)%/year for ≥ 3 cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer were 0.039 (0.031-0.049)%/year and 0.16 (0.14-0.18)%/year, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: By enrolling a large number of subjects with long-term follow-up, this study demonstrated that the risk of cancer increased steadily with increasing length of BE in the Japanese population. Therefore, it is important to consider the length of BE when determining the management strategy for BE."

Here, we evaluate the use of a radiomic approach to identify the HPV status of OPSCC.
METHODS: Four independent cohorts, totaling 778 OPSCC patients with HPV determined by p16 were collected. We randomly assigned 80% of all data for model training (N = 628) and 20% for validation (N = 150). On the pre-treatment CT images, 902 radiomic features were calculated from the gross tumor volume. Multivariable modeling was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. To assess the impact of CT artifacts in predicting HPV (p16), a model was developed on all training data (M<sub>all</sub>) and on the artifact-free subset of training data (M<sub>no art</sub>). Models were validated on all validation data (V<sub>all</sub>), and the subgroups with (V<sub>art</sub>) and without (V<sub>no art</sub>) artifacts. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare HPV status based on p16 and radiomic model predictions.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator curve for M<sub>all</sub> and M<sub>no art</sub> ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 and was not significantly different for all validation data sets. There was a consistent and significant split between survival curves with HPV status determined by p16 [p = 0.007; hazard ratio (HR): 0.46], M<sub>all</sub> (p = 0.036; HR: 0.55) and M<sub>no art</sub> (p = 0.027; HR: 0.49).
CONCLUSION: This study provides proof of concept that molecular information can be derived from standard medical images and shows potential for radiomics as imaging biomarker of HPV status. Advances in knowledge: Radiomics has the potential to identify clinically relevant molecular phenotypes."

Automated retinal image analysis software (ARIAS) could provide an alternative to human grading. We compare the performance of an ARIAS using true-colour, wide-field confocal scanning images and standard fundus images in the English National Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (NDESP) against human grading.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study with consecutive recruitment of patients attending annual diabetic eye screening. Imaging with mydriasis was performed (two-field protocol) with the EIDON platform (CenterVue, Padua, Italy) and standard NDESP cameras. Human grading was carried out according to NDESP protocol. Images were processed by EyeArt V.2.1.0 (Eyenuk Inc, Woodland Hills, California). The reference standard for analysis was the human grade of standard NDESP images.
RESULTS: We included 1257 patients. Sensitivity estimates for retinopathy grades were: EIDON images; 92.27% (95% CI: 88.43% to 94.69%) for any retinopathy, 99% (95% CI: 95.35% to 100%) for vision-threatening retinopathy and 100% (95% CI: 61% to 100%) for proliferative retinopathy. For NDESP images: 92.26% (95% CI: 88.37% to 94.69%) for any retinopathy, 100% (95% CI: 99.53% to 100%) for vision-threatening retinopathy and 100% (95% CI: 61% to 100%) for proliferative retinopathy. One case of vision-threatening retinopathy (R1M1) was missed by the EyeArt when analysing the EIDON images, but identified by the human graders. The EyeArt identified all cases of vision-threatening retinopathy in the standard images.
CONCLUSION: EyeArt identified diabetic retinopathy in EIDON images with similar sensitivity to standard images in a large-scale screening programme, exceeding the sensitivity threshold recommended for a screening test. Further work to optimise the identification of 'no retinopathy' and to understand the differential lesion detection in the two imaging systems would enhance the use of these two innovative technologies in a diabetic retinopathy screening setting."

In general, ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease, however cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants have been reported. Diagnosing ZIKV infection remains a challenge, as viral RNA detection is only applicable until a few days after the onset of symptoms. After that, serological tests must be applied, and, as expected, high cross-reactivity between ZIKV and other flavivirus serology is observed. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is indicated to confirm positive samples for being more specific, however it is laborious intensive and time consuming, representing a major bottleneck for patient diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we developed a high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for ZIKV infection by serological detection. Using 226 human specimens, we showed that the new test presented higher throughput than traditional PRNT, maintaining the correlation between results. Furthermore, when tested with dengue virus samples, it showed 50.53% less cross reactivity than MAC-ELISA. This fluorescent neutralization test could be used for clinical diagnosis confirmation of ZIKV infection, as well as for vaccine clinical trials and seroprevalence studies."

Epub 2016 Aug 17.,van Os HJ,Neurology,2016,2016/08/19,,,10.1212/WNL.0000000000003092,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of large vessel atherosclerosis, blood clot extent, and penumbra volume in relation to headache in ischemic stroke patients.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we performed noncontrast CT, CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP) in 284 participants from the Dutch Acute Stroke Study and Leiden Stroke Cohort within 9 hours after ischemic stroke onset. We collected headache characteristics prospectively using a semi-structured questionnaire. Atherosclerosis was assessed by evaluating presence of plaques in extracranial and intracranial vessels and by quantifying intracranial carotid artery calcifications. Clot extent was estimated by the clot burden score on CTA and penumbra volume by CTP. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with adjustments (aRR) for possible confounders using multivariable Poisson regression.
RESULTS: Headache during stroke was reported in 109/284 (38%) participants. Headache was less prevalent in patients with than in patients without atherosclerosis in the extracranial anterior circulation (35% vs 48%; RR 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.97). Atherosclerosis in the intracranial arteries was also associated with less headache, but this association was not statistically significant. Penumbra volume (aRR 1.08; 95% CI 0.63-1.85) and clot extent (aRR 1.02; 95% CI 0.86-1.20) were not related with headache.
CONCLUSIONS: Headache in the early phase of ischemic stroke tends to occur less often in patients with atherosclerosis than in patients without atherosclerosis in the large cerebral arteries. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that vessel wall elasticity is a necessary contributing factor in the occurrence of headache during acute ischemic stroke."

In assessing physical activity, caloric expenditure is a proxy marker reflecting the sum total of multiple physical activity types conducted by an individual.
OBJECTIVE: To assess caloric expenditure, as a proxy marker of PA, as a predictive measure of gray matter (GM) volumes in the normal and cognitively impaired elderly persons.
METHODS: All subjects in this study were recruited from the Institutional Review Board approved Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a multisite population-based longitudinal study in persons aged 65 and older. We analyzed a sub-sample of CHS participants 876 subjects (mean age 78.3, 57.5% F, 42.5% M) who had i) energy output assessed as kilocalories (kcal) per week using the standardized Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities questionnaire, ii) cognitive assessments for clinical classification of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and iii) volumetric MR imaging of the brain. Voxel-based morphometry modeled the relationship between kcal/week and GM volumes while accounting for standard covariates including head size, age, sex, white matter hyperintensity lesions, MCI or AD status, and site. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a False Discovery Rate of 5 percent.
RESULTS: Higher energy output, from a variety of physical activity types, was associated with larger GM volumes in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. High levels of caloric expenditure moderated neurodegeneration-associated volume loss in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and cerebellar vermis.
CONCLUSION: Increasing energy output from a variety of physical activities is related to larger gray matter volumes in the elderly, regardless of cognitive status."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional brain Magnetic Resonance I (MRI) study.
SETTING: Community based cohort in three U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A Caucasian and African-American sub-sample (n= 680; mean age 50.3 yrs) attending the 25 year follow-up exam of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: 3T brain MR images processed for quantitative estimates of: total brain (TBV) and abnormal white matter (AWM) volume; white matter fractional anisotropy (WM-FA); and gray matter cerebral blood flow (GM-CBF). Total intracranial volume is TBV plus cerebral spinal fluid (TICV). A Global Cognitive Function (GCF) score was derived from tests of speed, memory and executive function.
RESULTS: Adjusting for TICV and demographic factors, current smoking was significantly associated with lower GM-CBF and TBV, and more AWM (all <0.05); SA with lower GM-CBF, WM-FA and TBV (p=0.01); increasing BMI with decreasing GM-CBF (p<0003); hypertension with lower GM-CBF, WM-FA, and TBV and higher AWM (all <0.05); and diabetes with lower TBV (p=0.007). The GCS was lower as TBV decreased, AWM increased, and WM-FA (all p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: In middle age adults, CVRF are associated with brain health, reflected in MRI measures of structure and perfusion, and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest markers of mid-life cardiovascular and brain health should be considered as indication for early intervention and future risk of late-life cerebrovascular disease and dementia."

METHODS: This is an observational descriptive cross-sectional study which included 1st to 5th year medical students who were actively enrolled at the governmental colleges of medicine in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the COVID-19 lockdown. The sample size was estimated to be 287 medical students. Participants were asked to volunteer and fill an electronic online questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 300 medical students were included in this study. 94.0% reported at least one symptom of CVS, while 67% reported having more than three symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms were musculoskeletal pain (84.3%), headache (71.1%) and dry eyes (68%). Thirty-eight percent of the students experienced more severe symptoms, while 48% experienced more frequent symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk factors for having three or more symptoms were being a female (p < 0.001) and using electronic devices for longer periods (6.8 h ± 2.8) during COVID-19 lockdown (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: CVS prevalence during COVID-19 era among medical students is high. This necessitates increasing the awareness of CVS and its preventive measures."

Extracerebrally, 2 distinct mechanisms drive calcification, a nonatherosclerotic, rapid mineralization in the media and a slower, inflammation driven, atherosclerotic mechanism in the intima. This study aims to determine the prevalence, distribution, and type (atherosclerotic, nonatherosclerotic) of calcification in IAs and assess differences in occurrence between ruptured and unruptured IAs. Approach and Results: Sixty-five 65 IA specimens (48 unruptured, 17 ruptured) were resected perioperatively. Calcification and lipid pools were analyzed nondestructively in intact samples using high resolution (0.35 μm) microcomputed tomography. Calcification is highly prevalent (78%) appearing as micro (<500 µm), meso (500 µm-1 mm), and macro (>1 mm) calcifications. Calcification manifests in IAs as both nonatherosclerotic (calcification distinct from lipid pools) and atherosclerotic (calcification in the presence of lipid pools) with 3 wall types: Type I-only calcification, no lipid pools (20/51, 39%), Type II-calcification and lipid pools, not colocalized (19/51, 37%), Type III-calcification colocalized with lipid pools (12/51, 24%). Ruptured IAs either had no calcifications or had nonatherosclerotic micro- or meso-calcifications (Type I or II), without macro-calcifications.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcification in IAs is substantially more prevalent than previously reported and presents as both nonatherosclerotic and atherosclerotic types. Notably, ruptured aneurysms had only nonatherosclerotic calcification, had significantly lower calcification fraction, and did not contain macrocalcifications. Improved understanding of the role of calcification in IA pathology should lead to new therapeutic targets."

METHODS: A cross-sectional comparison of prospectively collected data consisting of bacterial and fungal cultures and smears from eyes with acute infectious keratitis at Aravind Eye Hospital. Two convolutional neural network architectures (DenseNet and MobileNet) were trained using images obtained from handheld cameras collected from culture-positive and negative images and smear-positive and -negative images. Each architecture was trained on two image sets: (1) one with labels assigned using only culture results and (2) one using culture and smear results. The outcome measure was area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting whether an ulcer would be microbiologically positive or negative.
RESULTS: There were 1970 images from 886 patients were included. None of the models were better than random chance at predicting positive microbiologic results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.49 to 0.56; all confidence intervals included 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: These two state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architectures could not reliably predict whether a corneal ulcer would be microbiologically positive or negative based on clinical photographs. This absence of detectable morphological differences informs the future development of computer vision models trained to predict the causative agent in infectious keratitis using corneal photography.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: These deep learning models were not able to identify morphological differences between microbiologically positive and negative corneal ulcers. This finding suggests that similar artificial intelligence models trained to identify the causative pathogen using only microbiologically positive cases may have potential to generalize well, including to cases with falsely negative microbiologic testing."

The most widely used method for rapid volume estimation is ABC/2, a simple algorithm that approximates lesion geometry as perfectly ellipsoid. The relative prognostic value of volume measurement based on more precise hematoma topology remains unknown. In this study, we compare volume measurements obtained using ABC/2 versus computer-assisted volumetry (CAV) for both intra- and extra-axial traumatic hemorrhages, and then quantify the association of measurements using both methods with patient outcome following moderate to severe TBI. A total of 517 computer tomography (CT) scans acquired during the Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury Experimental Clinical Treatment Phase-III (ProTECTIII) multi-center trial were retrospectively reviewed. Lesion volumes were measured using ABC/2 and CAV. Agreement between methods was tested using Bland-Altman analysis. Relationship of volume measurements with 6-month mortality, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), and Disability Rating Scale (DRS) were assessed using linear regression and area under the curve (AUC) analysis. In subdural hematoma (SDH) &gt;50cm3, ABC/2 and CAV produce significantly different volume measurements (p &lt; 0.0001), although the difference was not significant for smaller SDH or intra-axial lesions. The disparity between ABC/2 and CAV measurements varied significantly with hematoma size for both intra- and extra-axial lesions (p &lt; 0.0001). Across all lesions, volume was significantly associated with outcome using either method (p &lt; 0.001), but CAV measurement was a significantly better predictor of outcome than ABC/2 estimation for SDH. Among large traumatic SDH, ABC/2 significantly overestimates lesion volume compared with measurement based on precise bleed topology. CAV also offers significantly better prediction of patient functional outcofme and mortality."

However, its adaptation into daily practice has been fraught with challenges related to counting methodology. In this study, three reviewers used four counting methodologies to calculate Ki67 index in 68 well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: (1) 'eye-ball' estimation, which has been advocated as reliable and is widely used; (2) automated counting by image analyzer; (3) manual eye-counting (eye under a microscope without a grid); and (4) manual count of camera-captured/printed image. Pearson's correlation (R) was used to measure pair-wise correlation among three reviewers using all four methodologies. Average level of agreement was calculated using mean of R values. The results showed that: (1) 'eye-balling' was least expensive and fastest (average time <1 min) but had poor reliability and reproducibility. (2) Automated count was the most expensive and least practical with major impact on turnaround time (limited by machine and personnel accessibility), and, more importantly, had inaccuracies in overcounting unwanted material. (3) Manual eye count had no additional cost, averaged 6 min, but proved impractical and poorly reproducible. (4) Camera-captured/printed image was most reliable, had highest reproducibility, but took longer than 'eye-balling'. In conclusion, based on its comparatively low cost/benefit ratio and reproducibility, camera-captured/printed image appears to be the most practical for calculating Ki67 index. Although automated counting is generally advertised as the gold standard for index calculation, in this study it was not as accurate or cost-effective as camera-captured/printed image and was highly operator-dependent. 'Eye-balling' produces highly inaccurate and unreliable results, and is not recommended for routine use."

In addition, the liver has numerous endogenous micro-RNAs (miRs) that play important roles in the regulation of biological processes such as cell proliferation and hepatic fibrosis.
AIM: To assess diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and miRs in diagnosing and staging hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
METHODS: This prospective study included 208 patients and 82 age- and sex-matched controls who underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, miR profiling, and liver biopsy. Pathological scoring was classified according to the METAVIR scoring system. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and miR were calculated and correlated with pathological scoring.
RESULTS: The ADC value decreased significantly with the progression of fibrosis, from controls (F0) to patients with early fibrosis (F1 and F2) to those with late fibrosis (F3 and F4) (median 1.92, 1.53, and 1.25 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively) (P = 0.001). The cut-off ADC value used to differentiate patients from controls was 1.83 × 10-3 mm2/s with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992. Combining ADC and miR-200b revealed the highest AUC (0.995) for differentiating patients from controls with an accuracy of 96.9%. The cut-off ADC used to differentiate early fibrosis from late fibrosis was 1.54 × 10-3 mm2/s with an AUC of 0.866. The combination of ADC and miR-200b revealed the best AUC (0.925) for differentiating early fibrosis from late fibrosis with an accuracy of 80.2%. The ADC correlated with miR-200b (r = - 0.61, P = 0.001), miR-21 (r = - 0.62, P = 0.001), and miR-29 (r = 0.52, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Combining ADC and miRs offers an alternative surrogate non-invasive diagnostic tool for diagnosing and staging hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C."

Although neuroimaging is a primary diagnostic tool in the clinical assessment of TBI, our understanding of how specific neuroimaging findings relate to outcome remains limited. Our study aims to identify imaging biomarkers of long-term neurocognitive outcome after severe adolescent TBI. Twenty-four adolescents with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) enrolled in the ADAPT (Approaches and Decisions after Pediatric TBI) study were recruited for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning 1-2 years post-injury at 13 participating sites. Subjects underwent outcome assessments ∼1-year post-injury, including the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (IQ) and the Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE-Peds). A typically developing control cohort of 38 age-matched adolescents also underwent scanning and neurocognitive assessment. Brain-image segmentation was performed on T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images using Freesurfer. Brain and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid volumes were used to compute a ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) for each subject, and the corpus callosum cross-sectional area was determined in the midline for each subject. The TBI group demonstrated higher VBR and lower corpus callosum area compared to the control cohort. After adjusting for age and sex, VBR was significantly related with GOSE-Peds score in the TBI group (n = 24, p = 0.01, cumulative odds ratio = 2.18). After adjusting for age, sex, intracranial volume, and brain volume, corpus callosum cross-sectional area correlated significantly with IQ score in the TBI group (partial cor = 0.68, n = 18, p = 0.007) and with PSI (partial cor = 0.33, p = 0.02). No association was found between VBR and IQ or between corpus callosum and GOSE-Peds. After severe adolescent TBI, quantitative MRI measures of VBR and corpus callosum cross-sectional area are associated with global functional outcome and neurocognitive outcomes, respectively."

BACKGROUND: Avoiding BPD during TAVR was shown to be feasible in previous studies but the risks and benefits of this technique are unknown owing to the limited number of patients included in these studies.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search for studies comparing direct TAVR vs TAVR performed with BPD. Crude risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each endpoint were calculated using random effects models.
RESULTS: Twenty studies including 3586 patients (1606 undergoing direct TAVR) were selected for the analysis. Mean device success with direct TAVR was 88% with <5% of bail-out techniques. There were no differences between direct and BPD-TAVR in short-term (in-hospital or 30-day) mortality (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.78-1.43) or cerebrovascular events (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.58-1.46). Direct TAVR associated with reduced moderate or severe paravalvular leak post-TAVR (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36-0.98) but not with a reduced risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.71-1.02). A slight increase in postdilation was observed in direct transfemoral-TAVR recipients (RR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.00-1.44).
CONCLUSION: Direct TAVR is feasible and safe. However, given the unadjusted nature of our results, uncertainties remain regarding the independent effect of direct TAVR on outcomes post-TAVR. Randomized studies are warranted to determine the potential benefits of direct TAVR. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data about 47 patients with pathological OPSCC (15 HPV positive and 32 HPV negative) were collected from a public database. Using 2D and 3D manual segmentations, 1032 texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced CT images. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. Collinearity analysis and a wrapper-based subset search algorithm were used for feature selection. Models were created using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF) alone and with a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Classifier performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Compared with 2D segmentation (468 of 1032, 45.3%), 3D segmentation (576 of 1032, 55.8%) yielded more texture features with reliable reproducibility (good to excellent in both intraobserver and interobserver analyses) (p < 0.001). RF and k-NN classifiers failed to achieve better classification performance using 3D features than using 2D features either alone or with SMOTE. The best models for 2D and 3D segmentations were both created using RF, which alone achieved areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.880 and 0.847, respectively, and with SMOTE, AUCs of 0.953 and 0.920, respectively, were achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional segmentation had better CT texture feature reproducibility, but 2D segmentation showed better performance. Considering the cost, 2D segmentation is more recommended for ML-based classification of HPV status of OPSCC.
KEY POINTS: • Three-dimensional segmentation had better CT texture feature reproducibility than 2D segmentation. • Despite yielding more features with reliable reproducibility, 3D segmentation failed to provide better classification performance as compared to 2D for predicting HPV status of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. • The best models for 2D and 3D segmentations were both created using random forest classifier."

Epub 2018 Nov 13.,van Geel N,Br J Dermatol,2019,2018/09/13,,,10.1111/bjd.17190,"BACKGROUND: Objective measurement of target lesions in vitiligo is important for clinical practice and trials, yet no preferred tool has been defined. Reported digital tools have shortcomings related to feasibility aspects and often lack information on validity, reliability and responsiveness. Moreover, studies are not yet based on ultraviolet (UV) photography.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability, validity and feasibility of two functions in ImageJ for measurement of target lesions, based on three different types of images including UV pictures.
METHODS: Planimetric measurements were performed on photographs with and without UV, and lesion contours on transparent sheets of 52 vitiligo lesions from 10 patients with vitiligo. The ImageJ functions 'wand' and 'threshold' were used by three and four assessors, respectively. Inter- and intrarater reliability, hypothesis testing for construct validity, and feasibility were evaluated.
RESULTS: The inter- and intrarater reliability for the 'wand' and 'threshold' functions were excellent [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0·9] for measurement on pictures (with or without UV). The highest agreement (ICC > 0·95) and lowest variance were obtained for measurements on transparent sheets. All four hypotheses for construct validity were confirmed for all measurements. Overall, all measurement methods scored satisfactorily for user-friendliness. However, measurements on transparent sheets were preferred and the completion time was significantly faster.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the reliability, validity and feasibility of two functions in ImageJ to measure target lesions in vitiligo. Based on the feasibility and included three-dimensional aspects, transparent sheets measured with the ImageJ 'wand' function can be proposed for future trials as a reference method to investigate the criterion validity of other digital instruments."

METHODS: This observational study included adults with SCA (HbSS or Sβ0 thalassemia) aged 18 to 40 years. Participants received 3-tesla brain MRI and a detailed neurologic examination. Time-to-event analysis assessed those with or without baseline SCI and with new or progressive infarcts. The incidence rate of new events was compared by log-rank test. Univariable Cox regression assessed the association of SCI with infarct progression.
RESULTS: Among adults with SCA with 2 MRIs and at least 6 months between MRIs (n = 54, mean interval = 2.5 years), 43% had SCI at baseline. Of participants with baseline SCI, 30% had new or progressive SCI over 2.5 years compared to 6% with no SCI at baseline; no participant had an overt stroke. New SCIs at follow-up were present in 12.9 per 100 patient-years with existing SCI compared with 2.4 per 100 patient-years without prior SCI (log-rank test, p = 0.021). No statistically significant differences were seen among those with or without baseline SCI in use of hydroxyurea therapy, hydroxyurea dose, or other stroke risk factors. The presence of SCI was associated with increased hazard of a new or progressive infarct (hazard ratio 5.27, 95% confidence interval 1.09-25.51, p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Silent infarcts in adults with SCA are common and are a significant risk factor for future silent infarcts."

Epub 2015 Mar 19.,Squires MH 3rd,Ann Surg Oncol,2015,2015/03/20,,,10.1245/s10434-015-4471-x,"BACKGROUND: Clinicians may order Octreoscan or positron emission tomography (PET) scan for staging patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). (111)In-Octreoscan (Octreoscan) identifies tumors by radiolabeled targeting of somatostatin receptors, while 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) measures differential tissue glucose transport. We assessed the sensitivity of both nuclear imaging modalities with pathologic correlation to define the best initial choice for NET staging after standard cross-sectional imaging.
METHODS: We identified all patients diagnosed with NETs of gastrointestinal or pancreatic origin who underwent nuclear imaging staging by Octreoscan and/or PET from 2000 to 2013. Imaging results were correlated with tumor differentiation and grade of pathology specimens.
RESULTS: Imaging and pathology results were identified for 153 patients. Of these, 131 underwent Octreoscan, 43 underwent PET, and 21 patients had both performed. Overall sensitivity of Octreoscan and PET for NET detection was similar (77 vs. 72 %; p = not significant). For well-differentiated NETs, Octreoscan (n = 124) demonstrated sensitivity of 80 vs. 60 % (p = 0.28) for PET (n = 30). For poorly-differentiated NETs, Octreoscan (n = 7) proved significantly less sensitive than PET (n = 13) (57 vs. 100 %; p = 0.02). The sensitivity of Octreoscan versus PET varied similarly when analyzed by WHO tumor grade: Grade 1 (79 vs. 52 %; p = 0.16), Grade 2 (85 vs. 86 %; p = not significant), and Grade 3 (57 vs. 100 %; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor differentiation can be used to guide selection of nuclear imaging modalities for staging gastrointestinal and pancreatic NETs. Octreoscan appears more sensitive than (18)FDG-PET for well-differentiated NETs, whereas (18)FDG-PET demonstrates superior sensitivity for poorly-differentiated NETs."

Originally designed for pattern recognition and image processing, Deep Learning models are now applied to survival prognosis of cancer patients. Specifically, Deep Learning versions of the Cox proportional hazards models are trained with transcriptomic data to predict survival outcomes in cancer patients.
METHODS: In this study, a broad analysis was performed on TCGA cancers using a variety of Deep Learning-based models, including Cox-nnet, DeepSurv, and a method proposed by our group named AECOX (AutoEncoder with Cox regression network). Concordance index and p-value of the log-rank test are used to evaluate the model performances.
RESULTS: All models show competitive results across 12 cancer types. The last hidden layers of the Deep Learning approaches are lower dimensional representations of the input data that can be used for feature reduction and visualization. Furthermore, the prognosis performances reveal a negative correlation between model accuracy, overall survival time statistics, and tumor mutation burden (TMB), suggesting an association among overall survival time, TMB, and prognosis prediction accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep Learning based algorithms demonstrate superior performances than traditional machine learning based models. The cancer prognosis results measured in concordance index are indistinguishable across models while are highly variable across cancers. These findings shedding some light into the relationships between patient characteristics and survival learnability on a pan-cancer level."

Epub 2020 Nov 14.,Tankyevych O,Methods,2021,2020/11/16,,,10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.11.002,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential benefit of using alternative reconstruction schemes of PET images for the prognostic value of radiomic features.
METHODS: Patients (n=91) with non-small cell lung cancer were prospectively included. All had a PET/CT examination before treatment. Three different PET images were reconstructed for each patient: the standard clinical protocol (i.e., 4×4×4 mm3 voxels, 5mm Gaussian filter, denoted '200G5'), as well as using smaller voxels (i.e., 2×2×2 mm3 with a larger reconstruction matrix, denoted 400G1) and/or 1mm post-reconstruction Gaussian filter, denoted 200G1). Metabolic volumes of the primary tumors were semi-automatically delineated on the PET images and IBSI compliant radiomic features (intensity, shape, textural) were extracted. First, the distributions of 200G1 and 400G1 features were compared to the reference clinical protocol (200G5) through Bland-Altman tests and the use of linear mixed models. Then, the prognostic value of the features from each of the 3 reconstructions was evaluated in a univariate analysis, through their stratification power in Kaplan-Meier curves through a threshold set at the median.
RESULTS: The 3 reconstructions led to different distributions for most of the features. The larger shifts and standard deviations of differences was observed between 200G5 and 400G1, which was also confirmed through linear mixed models. However, these relatively important differences in distributions did not translate into a significant impact on the stratification power of the features in terms of prognosis, although a trend in decreasing prognostic value could be observed (smaller number of features with HR above 2, overall lower HR values). Most prognostic features displayed high correlation with either volume or SUV<sub>max</sub>, although there was great variability of prognostic value for similar levels of correlation with these basic metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: Using smaller voxels or less strong filtering options in the reconstruction settings of PET images compared to the standard clinical protocols led to different distributions of the resulting radiomic features. However, the hierarchy between patients according to these distributions remained overall the same and therefore the resulting stratification power of the radiomic features was not significantly altered. These results should be compared to those obtained in the context of other pathologies where radiomic features displaying lower correlation with volume or SUV<sub>max</sub> may have predictive value, such as in cervical cancer."

Social distancing is one of the measures that has been implemented with the aim of slowing the spread of the disease, but it is difficult for blind people to comply with this. In this paper, we present a system that helps blind people to maintain physical distance to other persons using a combination of RGB and depth cameras. We use a real-time semantic segmentation algorithm on the RGB camera to detect where persons are and use the depth camera to assess the distance to them; then, we provide audio feedback through bone-conducting headphones if a person is closer than 1.5 m. Our system warns the user only if persons are nearby but does not react to non-person objects such as walls, trees or doors; thus, it is not intrusive, and it is possible to use it in combination with other assistive devices. We have tested our prototype system on one blind and four blindfolded persons, and found that the system is precise, easy to use, and amounts to low cognitive load."

This review describes the various patient populations that have undergone morphometric analysis of kidney biopsies. The common approaches to morphometric analysis are described. The chronic kidney disease outcomes associated with various chronic changes by morphometry are also summarized. Morphometry enriches the characterization of chronicity on a kidney biopsy and this can supplement the pathologist's diagnosis. Artificial intelligence image processing tools are needed to automate the annotations needed for practical morphometric analysis of kidney biopsy specimens in routine clinical care."

Methods- Ischemic stroke data sets from the MRI-GENIE (MRI-Genetics Interface Exploration) repository consisting of 12 international genetic research centers were retrospectively analyzed using an automated deep learning segmentation algorithm consisting of an ensemble of 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks. Three ensembles were trained using data from the following: (1) 267 patients from an independent single-center cohort, (2) 267 patients from MRI-GENIE, and (3) mixture of (1) and (2). The algorithms' performances were compared against manual outlines from a separate 383 patient subset from MRI-GENIE. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression with respect to demographics, stroke subtypes, and vascular risk factors were performed to identify phenotypes associated with large acute diffusion-weighted MRI volumes and greater stroke severity in 2770 MRI-GENIE patients. Stroke topography was investigated. Results- The ensemble consisting of a mixture of MRI-GENIE and single-center convolutional neural networks performed best. Subset analysis comparing automated and manual lesion volumes in 383 patients found excellent correlation (ρ=0.92; P&lt;0.0001). Median (interquartile range) diffusion-weighted MRI lesion volumes from 2770 patients were 3.7 cm3 (0.9-16.6 cm3). Patients with small artery occlusion stroke subtype had smaller lesion volumes ( P&lt;0.0001) and different topography compared with other stroke subtypes. Conclusions- Automated accurate clinical diffusion-weighted MRI lesion segmentation using deep learning algorithms trained with multi-center and diverse data is feasible. Both lesion volume and topography can provide insight into stroke subtypes with sufficient sample size from big heterogeneous multi-center clinical imaging phenotype data sets."

Cellular neighborhood analysis is a popular computational approach for these complex image data. Despite its popularity, there are significant challenges, including high computational demands that limit feasibility for large-scale applications and the lack of a principled strategy for integrative analysis across images. This absence hampers the precise and consistent identification of spatial features and tracking of their dynamics over disease progression. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SpatialTopic, a spatial topic model designed to decode high-level spatial architecture across multiplexed tissue images. SpatialTopic integrates both cell type and spatial information within a topic modelling framework, originally developed for natural language processing and adapted for computer vision. Spatial information is incorporated into the flexible design of documents, representing densely overlapping regions in images. We employ an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for model inference. We benchmarked the performance against five state-of-the-art algorithms through various case studies using different single-cell spatial transcriptomic and proteomic imaging platforms across different tissue types. We show that SpatialTopic is highly scalable on large-scale image datasets with millions of cells, along with high precision and interpretability. Our findings demonstrate that SpatialTopic consistently identifies biologically and clinically significant spatial ""topics"" such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and tracks dynamic changes in spatial features over disease progression. Its computational efficiency and broad applicability across various molecular imaging platforms will enhance the analysis of large-scale tissue imaging datasets."

METHODS: A cohort of 102 patients who received stereotactic body radiation treatment was retrospectively investigated. A set of 45 textural features was computed for the tumor volumes on the treatment planning CT images. Patients were split into two independent cohorts (70 patients, 68.9%, for training; and 32 patients, 31.4%, for validation). Three different models were built in the study. A stepwise backward linear discriminant analysis was applied to identify patients at risk of lymph node progression. The performance of the model was assessed by means of standard metrics derived from the confusion matrix. Furthermore, all textural features were correlated to survival data to build two separate predictive models for progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DS-OS). These models were built from the features/predictors found significant in univariate analysis and elastic net regularization by means of a multivarate Cox regression with backward selection. Low- and high-risk groups were identified by maximizing the separation by means of the Youden method.
RESULTS: In the total cohort (77, 75.5%, males; and 25, 24.5%, females; median age 76.6 years), 15 patients presented nodal progression at the time of analysis; 19 patients (18.6%) died because of disease-specific causes, 25 (24.5%) died from other reasons, 28 (27.5%) were alive without disease, and 30 (29.4%) with either local or distant progression. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the classifier resulted 83.1 ± 24.5, 87.4 ± 1.2, and 85.4 ± 12.5 in the validation group (coherent with the findings in the training). The area under the curve for the classifier resulted in 0.84 ± 0.04 and 0.73 ± 0.05 for training and validation, respectively. The mean time for DS-OS and PFS for the low- and high-risk subgroups of patients (in the validation groups) were 88.2 month ± 9.0 month vs. 84.1 month ± 7.8 month (low risk) and 52.7 month ± 5.9 month vs. 44.6 month ± 9.2 month (high risk), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Radiomics analysis based on planning CT images allowed a classifier and predictive models capable of identifying patients at risk of nodal relapse and high-risk of bad prognosis to be built. The radiomics signatures identified were mostly related to tumor heterogeneity."

Patients with heart failure (HF), carotid occlusive disease (COD), and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) present themselves with complaints attributed to specific parts of the heart-brain axis, but hemodynamic changes often go beyond the part of the axis for which they primarily seek medical advice. The Heart-Brain Study hypothesizes that the hemodynamic status of the heart and the brain is an important but underestimated cause of VCI. We investigate this by studying to what extent hemodynamic changes contribute to VCI and what the mechanisms involved are. Here, we provide an overview of the design and protocol.
METHODS: The Heart-Brain Study is a multicenter cohort study with a follow-up measurement after 2 years among 645 participants (175 VCI, 175 COD, 175 HF, and 120 controls). Enrollment criteria are the following: 1 of the 3 diseases diagnosed according to current guidelines, age ≥50 years, no magnetic resonance contraindications, ability to undergo cognitive testing, and independence in daily life. A core clinical dataset is collected including sociodemographic factors, cardiovascular risk factors, detailed neurologic, cardiac, and medical history, medication, and a physical examination. In addition, we perform standardized neuropsychological testing, cardiac, vascular and brain MRI, and blood sampling. In subsets of participants we assess Alz-heimer biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, and assess echocardiography and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Follow-up measurements after 2 years include neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and blood samples for all participants. We use centralized state-of-the-art storage platforms for clinical and imaging data. Imaging data are processed centrally with automated standardized pipelines.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The Heart-Brain Study investigates relationships between (cardio-)vascular factors, the hemodynamic status of the heart and the brain, and cognitive impairment. By studying the complete heart-brain axis in patient groups that represent components of this axis, we have the opportunity to assess a combination of clinical and subclinical manifestations of disorders of the heart, vascular system and brain, with hemodynamic status as a possible binding factor."

The present study aimed to develop a food atlas with adequate visual reference to improve the accuracy of dietary surveys in China.
METHODS: A food atlas for dietary surveys in China was developed using three visual reference systems, namely, regularly placed food portions, the two-dimensional background coordinates and common objects known in daily life. The atlas was validated by estimating a meal before and after using the food atlas, and differences in weight estimation were compared using a paired t-test. In total, 50 college students participated in the study.
RESULTS: After determination of food varieties; design of the food display; purchase, processing, cooking and weighing of food; photographing food; post-image processing and data processing, a total of 799 pictures of 303 types of food and two types of tableware were produced. The mean value of food weight estimated with the atlas was closer to the actual weight, and the variation range of these values was smaller and more stable than that estimated without the atlas. The differences estimated before and after using the atlas for all foods were significant (P < 0.05). Comparing the differences in weight before using the atlas, the error ranges of food samples were reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: A food atlas has been developed for a retrospective dietary survey in China, which can be used to enable a better understanding of nutritional adequacy in the Chinese population."

Combining circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA), clinical variables, and radiomic phenotypes may improve prediction of EGFR-targeted therapy outcomes for NSCLC. This single-center retrospective study included 40 EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-targeted therapy. ctDNA data included number of mutations and detection of EGFR T790M. Clinical data included age, smoking status, and ECOG performance status. Baseline chest CT scans were analyzed to extract 429 radiomic features from each primary tumor. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to group tumors into phenotypes. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were modeled for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to compare fit between models. Among 40 patients (73% women, median age 62 years), consensus clustering identified two radiomic phenotypes. For PFS, the model combining radiomic phenotypes with ctDNA and clinical variables had c-statistic of 0.77 and a better fit (LRT p = 0.01) than the model with clinical and ctDNA variables alone with a c-statistic of 0.73. For OS, adding radiomic phenotypes resulted in c-statistic of 0.83 versus 0.80 when using clinical and ctDNA variables (LRT p = 0.08). Both models showed separation of K-M curves dichotomized by median prognostic score (p < 0.005). Combining radiomic phenotypes, ctDNA, and clinical variables may enhance precision oncology approaches to managing advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations."

Epub 2020 Jun 30.,Heydon P,Br J Ophthalmol,2021,2020/07/02,PMC8077216,,10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316594,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Human grading of digital images from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programmes represents a significant challenge, due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. We evaluate the performance of an automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to triage retinal images from the English Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (DESP) into test-positive/technical failure versus test-negative, using human grading following a standard national protocol as the reference standard.
METHODS: Retinal images from 30 405 consecutive screening episodes from three English DESPs were manually graded following a standard national protocol and by an automated process with machine learning enabled software, EyeArt v2.1. Screening performance (sensitivity, specificity) and diagnostic accuracy (95% CIs) were determined using human grades as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Sensitivity (95% CIs) of EyeArt was 95.7% (94.8% to 96.5%) for referable retinopathy (human graded ungradable, referable maculopathy, moderate-to-severe non-proliferative or proliferative). This comprises sensitivities of 98.3% (97.3% to 98.9%) for mild-to-moderate non-proliferative retinopathy with referable maculopathy, 100% (98.7%,100%) for moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and 100% (97.9%,100%) for proliferative disease. EyeArt agreed with the human grade of no retinopathy (specificity) in 68% (67% to 69%), with a specificity of 54.0% (53.4% to 54.5%) when combined with non-referable retinopathy.
CONCLUSION: The algorithm demonstrated safe levels of sensitivity for high-risk retinopathy in a real-world screening service, with specificity that could halve the workload for human graders. AI machine learning and deep learning algorithms such as this can provide clinically equivalent, rapid detection of retinopathy, particularly in settings where a trained workforce is unavailable or where large-scale and rapid results are needed."

DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Subjects from the Chinese American Eye Study underwent EyeCam goniophotography in 4 angle quadrants. A CNN classifier based on the ResNet-50 architecture was trained to detect angle closure, defined as inability to visualize the pigmented trabecular meshwork, using reference labels by a single experienced glaucoma specialist. The performance of the CNN classifier was assessed using an independent test dataset and reference labels by the single glaucoma specialist or a panel of 3 glaucoma specialists. This performance was compared to that of 9 human graders with a range of clinical experience. Outcome measures included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) metrics and Cohen kappa coefficients in the binary classification of open or closed angle.
RESULTS: The CNN classifier was developed using 29,706 open and 2,929 closed angle images. The independent test dataset was composed of 600 open and 400 closed angle images. The CNN classifier achieved excellent performance based on single-grader (AUC = 0.969) and consensus (AUC = 0.952) labels. The agreement between the CNN classifier and consensus labels (κ = 0.746) surpassed that of all non-reference human graders (κ = 0.578-0.702). Human grader agreement with consensus labels improved with clinical experience (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: A CNN classifier can effectively detect angle closure in goniophotographs with performance comparable to that of an experienced glaucoma specialist. This provides an automated method to support remote detection of patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma."

Accurate inter and intra-fraction motions is particularly important for intracranial and stereotactic radiation treatment which require high precision in dose delivery. Recently, a new immobilization device has been developed specifically for the radiation treatment of intracranial malignancies. To date, no data are available on the use of this device in daily clinical practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the intra and inter-fraction variations, patient comfort and radiographer confidence of the immobilization system from two distinct institutions: HagaZiekenhuis, Den Haag, Netherlands and IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore Don Calabria, Negrar, Italy.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixteen patients (10 diagnosed with brain metastases and 6 with primary central nervous systemic tumor) from IRCCS Ospedale Sacro Cuore Don Calabria and 17 patients (all diagnosed with brain metastases tumor) from HagaZiekenhuis were included in this study. The median target volume was 436 cc (range 3.2-1628 cc) and 4.58 cc (range 0.4-27.19 cc) for IRCCS and Haga, respectively. For patients treated in IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria, the median dose prescription was 30 Gy (range 27-60 Gy) and median number of fractions 10 (range 3-30). In Haga the median dose prescription was 21 Gy (range 8-21 Gy) and the median number of fraction was 1 (range 1-3). The immobilization device was assembled during CT simulation. A short interview to the patient regarding the device's comfort level was conducted at the end of the simulation procedure. Additionally, simulation setup time and radiographer (RTT) procedures (i.e. mask preparation) were evaluated. Prior to radiation treatment delivery, an automatic rigid match on the cranial bones between cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and planning-CT was performed. A couch shift was performed subsequently. An extra post-treatment CBCT was acquire after the treatment delivery. This post-treatment CBCT was matched with pre-treatment CBCT to identify any possible intra-fraction motion. All online matches were validated by experienced radiation oncologist or RTT. A total of 126 CBCT's were analyzed offline by radiation oncologist/medical physicist. The data of the pre-treatment CBCT match was used to quantify inter-fraction motion. The post-treatment CBCT was matched with pre-treatment CBCT to identify any possible intra-fraction motion.
RESULTS: During the molding of the mask, all patients responded positive to the comfort. Median time required by the RTTs to assemble the immobilization system was 9 min (range 6-12 min). In terms of comfort, all patients reported a good-to high level of satisfaction. The RTTs also respond positively towards the use of the locking mechanism and clips. Results of positioning uncertainties were comparable between the two institutes. The mean inter-fraction motion for all translational and rotational directions were < 2 mm (SD < 4 mm) and < 0.5°(SD < 1.5°), respectively, while the mean intra-fraction motions were < 0.4 mm (SD < 0.6 mm) and 0.3° (SD < 0.5°).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy and feasibility of the immobilization device in the intracranial radiation treatment. Both patient comfort and preparation time by RTTs are considered adequate. In combination with online daily imaging procedure, this device can achieve submillimeter accuracy required for intracranial and stereotactic treatments."

Originally developed for fixed oncology samples, here it was evaluated in highly fixed (up to 30 days), archived monkeypox virus-induced inflammatory skin lesions from a retrospective study in 11 rhesus monkeys to determine whether MxIF was comparable to manual H-scoring of chromogenic stains. Six protein markers related to immune and cellular response (CD68, CD3, Hsp70, Hsp90, ERK1/2, ERK1/2 pT202_pY204) were manually quantified (H-scores) by a pathologist from chromogenic IHC double stains on serial sections and compared to MxIF automated single cell quantification of the same markers that were multiplexed on a single tissue section. Overall, there was directional consistency between the H-score and the MxIF results for all markers except phosphorylated ERK1/2 (ERK1/2 pT202_pY204), which showed a decrease in the lesion compared to the adjacent non-lesioned skin by MxIF vs an increase via H-score. Improvements to automated segmentation using machine learning and adding additional cell markers for cell viability are future options for improvement. This method could be useful in infectious disease research as it conserves tissue, provides marker colocalization data on thousands of cells, allowing further cell level data mining as well as a reduction in user bias."

The purpose of this study was to predict a patient's obligation of intensive care treatment by evaluating the coronary calcium burden on the initial diagnostic LDCT.
METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with parallel LDCT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included from three centers. The primary endpoint was admission to ICU, tracheal intubation, or death in the 22-day follow-up period. CAC burden was represented by the Agatston score. Multivariate logistic regression was modeled for prediction of the primary endpoint by the independent variables ""Agatston score > 0"", as well as the CT lung involvement score, patient sex, age, clinical predictors of severe COVID-19 progression (history of hypertension, diabetes, prior cardiovascular event, active smoking, or hyperlipidemia), and laboratory parameters (creatinine, C-reactive protein, leucocyte, as well as thrombocyte counts, relative lymphocyte count, d-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase levels).
RESULTS: After excluding multicollinearity, ""Agatston score >0"" was an independent regressor within multivariate analysis for prediction of the primary endpoint (p<0.01). Further independent regressors were creatinine (p = 0.02) and leucocyte count (p = 0.04). The Agatston score was significantly higher for COVID-19 cases which completed the primary endpoint (64.2 [interquartile range 1.7-409.4] vs. 0 [interquartile range 0-0]).
CONCLUSION: CAC scoring on LDCT might help to predict future obligation of intensive care treatment at the day of patient admission to the hospital."

The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions. Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents. This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure segmentation protocol.
METHOD: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of agreement.
RESULTS: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and tail.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between published studies."

A total of 1266 previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors were assessed at four points: hospital admission (T0), at 8.4 months (T1), at 13.2 months (T2), and at 18.3 months (T3) after hospitalization. Participants were asked about their overall gastrointestinal symptoms and particularly diarrhea. Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital medical records. The prevalence of overall gastrointestinal post-COVID symptomatology was 6.3% (n = 80) at T1, 3.99% (n = 50) at T2 and 2.39% (n = 32) at T3. The prevalence of diarrhea decreased from 10.69% (n = 135) at hospital admission (T0), to 2.55% (n = 32) at T1, to 1.04% (n = 14) at T2, and to 0.64% (n = 8) at T3. The Sankey plots revealed that just 20 (1.59%) and 4 (0.32%) patients exhibited overall gastrointestinal post-COVID symptoms or diarrhea, respectively, throughout the whole follow-up period. The recovery fitted exponential curves revealed a decreasing prevalence trend, showing that diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms recover during the first two or three years after COVID-19 in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors. The regression models did not reveal any symptoms to be associated with the presence of gastrointestinal post-COVID symptomatology or post-COVID diarrhea at hospital admission or at T1. The use of Sankey plots revealed the fluctuating evolution of gastrointestinal post-COVID symptoms during the first two years after infection. In addition, exponential bar plots revealed the decreased prevalence of gastrointestinal post-COVID symptomatology during the first three years after infection."

Accurate determination of prematurity is necessary to provide appropriate neonatal care and guide preventive measures. To estimate the most accurate method to identify infants at risk for adverse outcomes, we assessed the validity of two widely available methods-last menstrual period (LMP) and the New Ballard (NB) neonatal assessment-against ultrasound in determining gestational age and preterm birth in highland Guatemala.
METHODS: Pregnant women (n = 188) were recruited with a gestational age <20 weeks and followed until delivery. Ultrasound was performed by trained physicians and LMP was collected during recruitment. NB was performed on infants within 96 hours of birth by trained study nurses. LMP and NB accuracy at determining gestational age and identifying prematurity was assessed by comparing them to ultrasound.
RESULTS: By ultrasound, infant mean gestational age at birth was 38.3 weeks (SD = 1.6) with 16% born at less than 37 gestation. LMP was more accurate than NB (mean difference of +0.13 weeks for LMP and +0.61 weeks for NB). However, LMP and NB estimates had low agreement with ultrasound-determined gestational age (Lin's concordance<0.48 for both methods) and preterm birth (κ<0.29 for both methods). By LMP, 18% were judged premature compared with 6% by NB. LMP underestimated gestational age among women presenting later to prenatal care (0.18 weeks for each additional week). Gestational age for preterm infants was overestimated by nearly one week using LMP and nearly two weeks using NB. New Ballard neuromuscular measurements were more predictive of preterm birth than those measuring physical criteria.
CONCLUSION: In an indigenous population in highland Guatemala, LMP overestimated prematurity by 2% and NB underestimated prematurity by 10% compared with ultrasound estimates. New, simple and accurate methods are needed to identify preterm birth in resource-limited settings worldwide."

METHODS: The THEIA™ artificial intelligence system for retinopathy and maculopathy screening, was developed at Toku Eyes using routinely collected retinal screening datasets from two of the largest district health boards in Auckland, New Zealand: the Auckland District Health Board and the Counties Manukau District Health Board. All retinal images from consecutive individuals receiving retinal screening between January 2009 and December 2018 were used. Images were labelled as non-sight-threatening, potentially referable or sight-threatening for New Zealand implementation, or as referable (potentially referable + sight-threatening)/non-referable (non-sight-threatening) for global comparison.
RESULTS: Data from 32 354 unique people with diabetes (63 843 when including multiple visits) were available, of which 95-97%, 0.9-2.4% and 1.1-3.1% were categorized as non-sight-threatening, potentially referable and sight-threatening, respectively. Using the referable/non-referable categories, THEIA achieved overall sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 92-95) in the Auckland District Health Board and 95% (95% CI 92-97) in the Counties Manukau District Health Board datasets, while preserving specificity of 63% (95% CI 62-64) for the Auckland District Health Board and 61% (95% CI 60-62) for the Counties Manukau District Health Board. Implementing THEIA into a New Zealand national diabetic screening programme could significantly reduce the manual grading load.
CONCLUSION: THEIA, an artificial intelligence tool to assist in clinical decision-making, tailored to the needs of the New Zealand national diabetic screening programme, delivered high sensitivity for detecting referable retinopathy within the multi-ethnic New Zealand population with diabetes."

However, soft-tissue attenuation is a common artifact that limits the diagnostic accuracy of MPI. The aim of this study was to determine whether attenuation correction (AC) improved the diagnostic performance of MPI, using coronary angiography as a reference standard.
METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until March 2015 for studies evaluating AC MPI for the diagnosis of CAD. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. For each study, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of AC versus non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) MPI. A bivariate mixed-effects model was applied for pooling the data.
RESULTS: Of 201 articles, 17 studies (1,701 patients) were identified, including 5 studies that used CT AC, 12 studies that used radionuclide source AC (RAC), and 15 studies that reported NAC results. The pooled sensitivities across studies were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.64-0.91), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.88), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79-0.88), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.85) for CT AC, RAC, all AC, and NAC, respectively. The pooled specificities were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71-0.91), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.86), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85), and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.74). Both sensitivities and specificities resulted in a pooled diagnostic odds ratio of 20 (95% CI, 12-34), 24 (95% CI, 13-43), 22 (95% CI, 13-35), and 9 (7-11). Significant differences in specificity and diagnostic odds ratios were noted when AC (including CT AC, RAC, and all AC) was compared with NAC.
CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggested that AC should be applied to MPI to improve the diagnosis of CAD, especially the specificity."

Because these two targets alter tumor vascularity and metabolism, respectively, we hypothesized multiparametric MR-PET could be used to quantify the response, estimate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, and predict progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multiparametric advanced MR-PET imaging was performed to evaluate physiologic response in a first-in-man, multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of GDC-0084 (NCT01547546) in 47 patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
RESULTS: Measured maximum concentration (C <sub>max</sub>) was associated with a decrease in enhancing tumor volume (P = 0.0287) and an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA; P = 0.0418). Posttreatment tumor volume, 18F-FDG uptake, Ktrans, and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were all correlated with C <sub>max</sub>. A linear combination of change in 18F-FDG PET uptake, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), FA, Ktrans, v<sub>p</sub>, and rCBV was able to estimate both C <sub>max</sub> (R2 = 0.4113; P &lt; 0.0001) and drug exposure (AUC; R2 = 0.3481; P &lt; 0.0001). Using this composite multiparametric MR-PET imaging response biomarker to predict PK, patients with an estimated C <sub>max</sub> &gt; 0.1 μmol/L and AUC &gt; 1.25 μmol/L*hour demonstrated significantly longer PFS compared with patients with a lower estimated concentration and exposure (P = 0.0039 and P = 0.0296, respectively).

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we extracted 17 computational DCE-MRI features to characterize tumor and parenchyma in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (n = 126). The percentage of stromal TILs was evaluated on H&E-stained histological whole-tumor sections. We first evaluated associations between individual imaging features and TILs. Multiple-hypothesis testing was corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method using false discovery rate (FDR). Second, we implemented LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and linear regression nested with tenfold cross-validation to develop an imaging signature for TILs. Next, we built a composite prediction model for TILs by combining imaging signature with molecular features. Finally, we tested the prognostic significance of the TIL model in an independent cohort (I-SPY 1; n = 106).
RESULTS: Four imaging features were significantly associated with TILs (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.2), including tumor volume, cluster shade of signal enhancement ratio (SER), mean SER of tumor-surrounding background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), and proportion of BPE. Among molecular and clinicopathological factors, only cytolytic score was correlated with TILs (ρ = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.63; P = 1.6E-9). An imaging signature that linearly combines five features showed correlation with TILs (ρ = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.54; P = 4.2E-6). A composite model combining the imaging signature and cytolytic score improved correlation with TILs (ρ = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50-0.72; P = 9.7E-15). The composite model successfully distinguished low vs high, intermediate vs high, and low vs intermediate TIL groups, with AUCs of 0.94, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively. During validation (I-SPY 1), the predicted TILs from the imaging signature separated patients into two groups with distinct recurrence-free survival (RFS), with log-rank P = 0.042 among triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The composite model further improved stratification of patients with distinct RFS (log-rank P = 0.0008), where TNBC with no/minimal TILs had a worse prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific MRI features of tumor and parenchyma are associated with TILs in breast cancer, and imaging may play an important role in the evaluation of TILs by providing key complementary information in equivocal cases or situations that are prone to sampling bias."

Epub 2021 Feb 6.,Chen JS,Ophthalmol Retina,2021,2021/02/09,PMC8364291,NIHMS1671176,10.1016/j.oret.2020.12.013,"PURPOSE: Stage is an important feature to identify in retinal images of infants at risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The purpose of this study was to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary detection of stages 1, 2, and 3 in ROP and to evaluate its generalizability across different populations and camera systems.
DESIGN: Diagnostic validation study of CNN for stage detection.
PARTICIPANTS: Retinal fundus images obtained from preterm infants during routine ROP screenings.
METHODS: Two datasets were used: 5943 fundus images obtained by RetCam camera (Natus Medical, Pleasanton, CA) from 9 North American institutions and 5049 images obtained by 3nethra camera (Forus Health Incorporated, Bengaluru, India) from 4 hospitals in Nepal. Images were labeled based on the presence of stage by 1 to 3 expert graders. Three CNN models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation on datasets from North America alone, Nepal alone, and a combined dataset and were evaluated on 2 held-out test sets consisting of 708 and 247 images from the Nepali and North American datasets, respectively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Convolutional neural network performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity, and specificity.
RESULTS: Both the North American- and Nepali-trained models demonstrated high performance on a test set from the same population: AUROC, 0.99; AUPRC, 0.98; sensitivity, 94%; and AUROC, 0.97; AUPRC, 0.91; and sensitivity, 73%; respectively. However, the performance of each model decreased to AUROC of 0.96 and AUPRC of 0.88 (sensitivity, 52%) and AUROC of 0.62 and AUPRC of 0.36 (sensitivity, 44%) when evaluated on a test set from the other population. Compared with the models trained on individual datasets, the model trained on a combined dataset achieved improved performance on each respective test set: sensitivity improved from 94% to 98% on the North American test set and from 73% to 82% on the Nepali test set.
CONCLUSIONS: A CNN can identify accurately the presence of ROP stage in retinal images, but performance depends on the similarity between training and testing populations. We demonstrated that internal and external performance can be improved by increasing the heterogeneity of the training dataset features of the training dataset, in this case by combining images from different populations and cameras."

Our aim was to determine the degree to which genetic and environmental variation in subcortical MD is distinct from variation in subcortical volume. Data were derived from a sample of 387 male twins (83 MZ twin pairs, 55 DZ twin pairs, and 111 incomplete twin pairs) who were MRI scanned as part of the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Quantitative estimates of MD and volume for 7 subcortical regions were obtained: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens. After adjusting for covariates, bivariate twin models were fitted to estimate the size and significance of phenotypic, genotypic, and environmental correlations between MD and volume at each subcortical region. With the exception of the amygdala, familial aggregation in MD was entirely explained by additive genetic factors across all subcortical regions with estimates ranging from 46 to 84%. Based on bivariate twin modeling, variation in subcortical MD appears to be both genetically and environmentally unrelated to individual differences in subcortical volume. Therefore, subcortical MD may be an alternative biomarker of brain morphology for complex traits worthy of future investigation. Hum Brain Mapp 38:2589-2598, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Here we present a platform for training and qualifying new tracers to perform the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on magnetic resonance images (MRI) following the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (EADC-ADNI) Harmonized Protocol (HarP). Our objective was to demonstrate that the training process embedded in the platform leads to increased compliance and qualification with the HarP.
METHOD: Thirteen new tracers' segmentations were compared with benchmark images with respect to: (a) absolute segmentation volume; (b) spatial overlap of contour with the reference using the Jaccard similarity index; and (c) spatial distance of contour with the reference. Point by point visual feedback was provided through three training phases on 10 MRI. Tracers were then tested on 10 different MRIs in the qualification phase.
RESULTS: Statistical testing of training over three phases showed a significant increase of Jaccard (i.e. mean Jaccard overlap P < .001) between phases on average for all raters, demonstrating that training positively increased compliance with the HarP. Based on these results we defined qualification thresholds which all tracers were able to meet.
CONCLUSIONS: This platform is an adequate infrastructure allowing standardized training and evaluation of tracers' compliance with the HarP. This is a necessary step allowing the use of hippocampal volumetry as a biomarker for AD in clinical and research centers."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was received from all patients. Twelve consecutive patients who were referred to assess the feasibility of radiofrequency ablation or biopsy were enrolled. Automatic registration using CT and MR images was performed in each patient. Registration errors during optimal and opposite respiratory phases, time required for image fusion and number of point locks used were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: The registration errors during optimal respiratory phase were not significantly different between image fusion using CT and MR images as reference data sets (p = 0.969). During opposite respiratory phase, the registration error was smaller with MR images than CT (p = 0.028). The time and the number of points locks needed for complete image fusion were not significantly different between CT and MR images (p = 0.328 and p = 0.317, respectively).
CONCLUSION: MR images would be more suitable as the reference data set for fusion imaging-guided procedures of focal hepatic lesions than CT images."

Whether this condition is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) and whether venous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is beneficial in persons with MS and CCSVI is controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of venous PTA in patients with MS and CCSVI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 177 patients with relapsing-remitting MS; 62 were ineligible, including 47 (26.6%) who did not have CCSVI on color Doppler ultrasonography screening. A total of 115 patients were recruited in the study timeframe. All patients underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial in 6 MS centers in Italy. The trial began in August 2012 and concluded in March 2016; data were analyzed from April 2016 to September 2016. The analysis was intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated (2:1) to either venous PTA or catheter venography without venous angioplasty (sham).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Two primary end points were assessed at 12 months: (1) a composite functional measure (ie, walking control, balance, manual dexterity, postvoid residual urine volume, and visual acuity) and (2) a measure of new combined brain lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, including the proportion of lesion-free patients. Combined lesions included T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions plus new or enlarged T2 lesions.
RESULTS: Of the included 115 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, 76 were allocated to the PTA group (45 female [59%]; mean [SD] age, 40.0 [10.3] years) and 39 to the sham group (29 female [74%]; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [10.6] years); 112 (97.4%) completed follow-up. No serious adverse events occurred. Flow restoration was achieved in 38 of 71 patients (54%) in the PTA group. The functional composite measure did not differ between the PTA and sham groups (41.7% vs 48.7%; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.34-1.68; P = .49). The mean (SD) number of combined lesions on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 to 12 months were 0.47 (1.19) in the PTA group vs 1.27 (2.65) in the sham group (mean ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.91; P = .03: adjusted P = .09) and were 1.40 (4.21) in the PTA group vs 1.95 (3.73) in the sham group at 0 to 12 months (mean ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.32-1.63; P = .45; adjusted P = .45). At follow-up after 6 to 12 months, 58 of 70 patients (83%) in the PTA group and 22 of 33 (67%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.11-6.28; P = .03; adjusted P = .09). At 0 to 12 months, 46 of 73 patients (63.0%) in the PTA group and 18 of 37 (49%) in the sham group were free of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.81-4.01; P = .15; adjusted P = .30).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Venous PTA has proven to be a safe but largely ineffective technique; the treatment cannot be recommended in patients with MS.

Neural alterations reportedly contribute to both pedophilia and CSO, but until now, no study has distinguished the brain structural anomalies associated with pedophilia from those specifically associated with CSO in pedophilic men. Using high-resolution T1-weighted brain images and voxel-based morphometry, we analyzed the gray matter (GM) volume of the following 219 men recruited at four acquisition sites in Germany: 58 pedophiles with a history of CSO, 60 pedophiles without any history of CSO and 101 non-pedophilic, non-offending controls to control for the effects of age, education level, verbal IQ, sexual orientation and the acquisition site. Although there were no differences in the relative GM volume of the brain specifically associated with pedophilia, statistical parametric maps revealed a highly significant and CSO-related pattern of above vs below the 'normal' GM volume in the right temporal pole, with non-offending pedophiles exhibiting larger volumes than offending pedophiles. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that the lower GM volume of the dorsomedial prefrontal or anterior cingulate cortex was associated with a higher risk of re-offending in pedophilic child molesters. We believe our data provide the first evidence that CSO in pedophilia rather than pedophilia alone is associated with GM anomalies and thus shed new light on the results of previous studies on this topic. These results indicate the need for new neurobehavioral theories on pedophilia and CSO and may be potentially useful for treatment or prevention approaches that aim to reduce the risk of (re)offending in pedophilia."

OBJECTIVE: To identify the associations of prenatal exposure to illicit drugs with organization of the newborn brain.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this cohort study, a volunteer sample of 210 illicit drug-using and nonusing mothers and their newborns was enrolled from prenatal clinics and drug abuse treatment programs in New York, New York. Enrollment, scanning, and long-term follow-up occurred from September 2004 through February 2012, and image processing and statistical analyses continued through fall 2018. In addition to 26 participants with incomplete data, a total of 64 mothers were lost to follow-up during pregnancy, and 13 newborns were lost to follow-up at birth because of perinatal complications.
EXPOSURES: Newborns were assigned to 1 of 4 primary exposure groups based on the history of most frequent maternal drug use: marijuana, cocaine, methadone maintenance, and/or heroin. Unexposed newborns were controls.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Unsedated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of newborn brains was performed shortly after birth. Infant neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed at age 12 months. MRI modalities included anatomical imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, T2 relaxometry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Infant neurodevelopmental outcomes included Bayley scales of infant development-III and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Statistical analyses were performed with results represented on the brain images.
RESULTS: Of 118 mothers, 42 (35%) were in the control group (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [6.1] years), 29 (25%) were in the cocaine group (mean [SD] age, 29.0 [6.1] years), 29 (25%) were in the marijuana group (mean [SD] age, 24.3 [5.5] years), and 18 (15%) were in the methadone and/or heroin group (mean [SD] age, 30.9 [5.7] years). Not all newborns could be scanned successfully; therefore, usable MRIs were acquired for 118 newborns from predominantly minority groups and with economically disadvantaged mothers. Anatomic abnormalities were detected in similar locations across all 3 drug exposures and included smaller volumes in the dorsal, medial, and ventral surfaces of the frontal lobe and dose-related increases in volumes in the lateral temporal lobe, dorsal parietal lobe, and superior frontal gyrus. Dose-related increases in diffusion tensor measures of tissue organization, decreases in T2 relaxometry times, and increases in spectroscopy metabolite concentrations were similar across exposures. These associations of exposures with brain measures were similar to the associations of newborn age with brain measures. The anatomic and diffusion tensor imaging measures suppressively mediated the associations of prenatal exposure with poorer 12-month infant outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that prenatal drug exposure is associated with measures of newborn brain tissue in patterns that may indicate that exposures accelerated normal fetal brain maturation, which in turn mediated the associations with poorer 12-month infant outcomes."

Machine learning and deep learning techniques can yield tools that efficiently segment videos of cataract surgery into constituent phases for subsequent automated skill assessment and feedback.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate machine learning and deep learning algorithms for automated phase classification of manually presegmented phases in videos of cataract surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cross-sectional study using a data set of videos from a convenience sample of 100 cataract procedures performed by faculty and trainee surgeons in an ophthalmology residency program from July 2011 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics for surgeons and patients were not captured. Ten standard labels in the procedure and 14 instruments used during surgery were manually annotated, which served as the ground truth.
EXPOSURES: Five algorithms with different input data: (1) a support vector machine input with cross-sectional instrument label data; (2) a recurrent neural network (RNN) input with a time series of instrument labels; (3) a convolutional neural network (CNN) input with cross-sectional image data; (4) a CNN-RNN input with a time series of images; and (5) a CNN-RNN input with time series of images and instrument labels. Each algorithm was evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
RESULTS: Unweighted accuracy for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.915 and 0.959. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.712 and 0.773, with small differences among them. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the image-only CNN-RNN (0.752) was significantly greater than that of the CNN with cross-sectional image data (0.712) (difference, -0.040; 95% CI, -0.049 to -0.033) and the CNN-RNN with images and instrument labels (0.737) (difference, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.018). While specificity was uniformly high for all phases with all 5 algorithms (range, 0.877 to 0.999), sensitivity ranged between 0.005 (95% CI, 0.000 to 0.015) for the support vector machine for wound closure (corneal hydration) and 0.974 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.991) for the RNN for main incision. Precision ranged between 0.283 and 0.963.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between zip code-level racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic composition and rates of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) among Medicare patients living within large metropolitan areas with TAVR programs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, nationwide cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, included beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare who were 66 years or older living in the 25 largest metropolitan core-based statistical areas.
EXPOSURE: Receipt of TAVR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The association between zip code-level racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic composition and rates of TAVR per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries.
RESULTS: Within the studied metropolitan areas, there were 7590 individual zip codes. The mean (SD) age of Medicare beneficiaries within these areas was 71.4 (2.0) years, a mean (SD) of 47.6% (5.8%) of beneficiaries were men, and a mean (SD) of 4.0% (7.0%) were Asian, 11.1% (18.9%) were Black, 8.0% (12.9%) were Hispanic, and 73.8% (24.9%) were White. The mean number of TAVRs per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries by zip code was 249 (IQR, 0-429). For each $1000 decrease in median household income, the number of TAVR procedures performed per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries was 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%) lower (P = .002). For each 1% increase in the proportion of patients who were dually eligible for Medicaid services, the number of TAVR procedures performed per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries was 2.1% (95% CI, 1.3%-2.9%) lower (P < .001). For each 1-unit increase in the Distressed Communities Index score, the number of TAVR procedures performed per 100 000 Medicare beneficiaries was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.5%) lower (P < .001). Rates of TAVR were lower in zip codes with higher proportions of patients of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity, despite adjusting for socioeconomic markers, age, and clinical comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within major metropolitan areas in the US with TAVR programs, zip codes with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic patients and those with greater socioeconomic disadvantages had lower rates of TAVR, adjusting for age and clinical comorbidities. Whether this reflects a different burden of symptomatic aortic stenosis by race and socioeconomic status or disparities in use of TAVR requires further study."

Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87% with a negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data. However, sensitivity was 0.66-0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis. Such tools can pave the path for multi-modal high throughput detection of COVID-Pneumonia in screening and referral."

Epub 2016 Mar 8.,Cecchin D,Eur J Surg Oncol,2016,2016/03/24,,,10.1016/j.ejso.2016.02.250,"INTRODUCTION: Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP) can be performed as an alternative to amputation for soft tissue sarcomas and melanomas of the extremities. Melphalan and tumor necrosis factor-alpha are used at a dosage that depends on the volume of the limb. Regional tissue volume is traditionally measured for the purposes of HILP using water displacement volumetry (WDV). Although this technique is considered the gold standard, it is time-consuming and complicated to implement, especially in obese and elderly patients.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to compare the different methods described in the literature for calculating regional tissue volume in the HILP setting, and to validate an open source software.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 22 patients (11 males and 11 females) who had non-disseminated melanoma with in-transit metastases or sarcoma of the lower limb. We calculated the volume of the limb using four different methods: WDV, tape measurements and segmentation of computed tomography images using Osirix and Oncentra Masterplan softwares.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The overall comparison provided a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.92 for the calculations of whole limb volume. In particular, when Osirix was compared with Oncentra (validated for volume measures and used in radiotherapy), the concordance was near-perfect for the calculation of the whole limb volume (CCC = 0.99). With methods based on CT the user can choose a reliable plane for segmentation purposes. CT-based methods also provides the opportunity to separate the whole limb volume into defined tissue volumes (cortical bone, fat and water)."

OBJECTIVE: To identify subtypes of bvFTD syndrome based on distinctive patterns of atrophy defined by selective vulnerability of specific functional networks targeted in bvFTD using statistical classification approaches.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective observational study, 90 patients meeting the Frontotemporal Dementia Consortium consensus criteria for bvFTD underwent evaluation at the Memory and Aging Center of the Department of Neurology at University of California, San Francisco. Patients underwent a multidisciplinary clinical evaluation, including clinical demographics, genetic testing, symptom evaluation, neurologic examination, neuropsychological bedside testing, and socioemotional assessments. All patients underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at their earliest evaluation at the memory clinic. From each patient's structural imaging scans, the mean volumes of 18 regions of interest (ROI) constituting the functional networks specifically vulnerable in bvFTD, including the salience network (SN), with key nodes in the frontoinsula and pregenual anterior cingulate, and the semantic appraisal network (SAN), anchored in the anterior temporal lobe and subgenual cingulate, were estimated. Principal component and cluster analyses of ROI volumes were used to identify patient clusters with anatomically distinct atrophy patterns. Data were collected from from June 19, 2002, to January 13, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Evaluation of brain morphology and other clinical features, including presenting symptoms, neurologic examination signs, neuropsychological performance, rate of dementia progression, and socioemotional function, in each patient cluster.
RESULTS: Ninety patients (54 men [60%]; 36 women [40%]; mean [SD] age at evaluation, 55.1 [9.7] years) were included in the analysis. Four subgroups of patients with bvFTD with distinct anatomic patterns of network degeneration were identified, including 2 salience network-predominant subgroups (frontal/temporal [SN-FT] and frontal [SN-F]), a semantic appraisal network-predominant group (SAN), and a subcortical-predominant group. Subgroups demonstrated distinct patterns of cognitive, socioemotional, and motor symptoms, as well as genetic compositions and estimated rates of disease progression.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Divergent patterns of vulnerability in specific functional network components make an important contribution to the clinical heterogeneity of bvFTD. The data-driven anatomic classification identifies biologically meaningful anatomic phenotypes and provides a replicable approach to disambiguate the bvFTD syndrome."

We aimed to investigate the current use of neuroimaging, electromagnetic source localization, and imaging postprocessing procedures in participating centers.
METHODS: A survey on the clinical use of imaging, electromagnetic source localization, and postprocessing methods in epilepsy surgery candidates was distributed among the 25 centers of the consortium. A descriptive analysis was performed, and results were compared to existing guidelines and recommendations.
RESULTS: Response rate was 96%. Standard epilepsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols are acquired at 3 Tesla by 15 centers and at 1.5 Tesla by 9 centers. Three centers perform 3T MRI only if indicated. Twenty-six different MRI sequences were reported. Six centers follow all guideline-recommended MRI sequences with the proposed slice orientation and slice thickness or voxel size. Additional sequences are used by 22 centers. MRI postprocessing methods are used in 16 centers. Interictal positron emission tomography (PET) is available in 22 centers; all using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Seventeen centers perform PET postprocessing. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is used by 19 centers, of which 15 perform postprocessing. Four centers perform neither PET nor SPECT in children. Seven centers apply magnetoencephalography (MEG) source localization, and nine apply electroencephalography (EEG) source localization. Fourteen combinations of inverse methods and volume conduction models are used.
SIGNIFICANCE: We report a large variation in the presurgical diagnostic workup among epilepsy surgery centers across Europe. This diversity underscores the need for high-quality systematic reviews, evidence-based recommendations, and harmonization of available diagnostic presurgical methods."

Liver biopsy is the reference standard to diagnose NAFLD but invasive, thus it is not the best choice in clinical diagnosis and follow-up. Magnetic resonance (MR) is widely used in clinical trials to noninvasively quantify liver fat content in adults and children in foreign countries. While currently, it is rarely used in Chinese children and adolescents. We postulated that quantifying hepatic steatosis by MR could be extended to children and adolescents in China.
AIM: To investigate the accuracy of MR imaging (MRI) in quantifying liver fat with MR spectroscopy (MRS) as a reference. A secondary goal was to assess the prevalence of NAFLD in overweight and obese Chinese children and adolescents.
METHODS: There were 86 children and adolescents enrolled in this study, including 65 overweight and obese children and 21 healthy children. The participants underwent MRI and MRS. MRI and MRS were performed using multi-echo Dixon and HISTO sequences, respectively, to calculate hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed using MRS-PDFF > 5% as the threshold. Spearman's analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between MRI and MRS. The agreement between these two methods was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: The MRI-PDFF in the MRS region of interest and the entire liver was 9.9% ± 10.3% with a range of 0.3%-39.9%, and 10.6% ± 9.4% with a range of 1.9%-38.9%, respectively. The MRS-PDFF was 9.1% ± 10.0%, with a range of 0.5%-37.8%. The incidence of hepatic steatosis detected by MRS-PDFF was 46.5% (40/86) of all participants, all of whom belonged to the overweight and obese group. Spearman's analysis indicated an excellent correlation between multi-echo Dixon and MRS (r &gt; 0.9, P &lt; 0.01). Bland-Altman analysis also demonstrated a good agreement between these two methods.
CONCLUSION: Multi-echo Dixon shows an excellent correlation and agreement with MRS in quantifying liver fat content and could be a potential tool to detect hepatic steatosis in Chinese children and adolescents."

This study evaluates whether craniosynostosis patients with CMI have an imbalance between cerebellar volume (CV) and posterior fossa volume (PFV), that is, an overcrowded posterior fossa.
METHODS: Volumes were measured in 3D-SPGR T1-weighted MR scans of 28 'not-operated' craniosynostosis patients (mean age: 4.0 years; range: 0-14), 85 'operated' craniosynostosis patients (mean age: 8.0 years; range: 1-18), and 34 control subjects (mean age: 5.4 years; range: 0-15). Volumes and CV/PFV ratios were compared between the operated and not-operated craniosynostosis patients, between the individual craniosynostosis syndromes and controls, and between craniosynostosis patients with and without CMI. Data were logarithmically transformed and studied with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
RESULTS: The CV, PFV, and CV/PFV ratios of not-operated craniosynostosis patients and operated craniosynostosis patients were similar to those of the control subjects. None of the individual syndromes was associated with a restricted PFV. However, craniosynostosis patients with CMI had a significantly higher CV/PFV ratio than the control group (0.77 vs. 0.75; p = 0.008). The range of CV/PFV ratios for craniosynostosis patients with CMI, however, did not exceed the normal range.
CONCLUSION: Volumes and CV/PFV ratio cannot predict which craniosynostosis patients are more prone to developing CMI than others. Treatment should focus on the skull vault and other contributing factors to increased ICP, including OSA and venous hypertension."

The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape.
METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40°). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner. Four radiologists visually graded and compared the visibility of the bone shape of eight regions on MRI- and CT-scans using a 5-point grading system.
RESULTS: The diagnostic ability of MRI with respect to the 5th metacarpals, femur, fibula, and pelvis was superior to CT (all, P < 0.050); there was no significant difference in the evaluation results of observers with respect to the cervical and lumbar spine, and the 5th metatarsal (0.058 ≤ P ≤ 1.000). However, the diagnostic ability of MRI was significantly inferior to CT for the assessment of the bone shape of the thoracic spine (observers A and C: P = 0.002, observers B and D: P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The MRI method we developed represents a potential alternative to CT imaging for the evaluation of the fetal bone structure."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cohort included 240 and 204 HNC patients in the training and validation analysis, respectively. Clinical variables were scored prospectively and IBMs of the primary tumor and lymph nodes were extracted from planning CT-images. Clinical, IBM and combined models were created from multivariable Cox proportional-hazard analyses based on clinical features, IBMs, and both for LC, RC, DMFS and DFS.
RESULTS: Clinical variables identified in the multivariable analysis included tumor-site, WHO performance-score, tumor-stage and age. Bounding-box-volume describing the tumor volume and irregular shape, IBM correlation representing radiological heterogeneity, and LN_major-axis-length showing the distance between lymph nodes were included in the IBM models. The performance of IBM LC, RC, DMFS and DFS models (c-index(validated):0.62, 0.80, 0.68 and 0.65) were comparable to that of the clinical models (0.62, 0.76, 0.70 and 0.66). The combined DFS model (0.70) including clinical features and IBMs performed significantly better than the clinical model. Patients stratified with the combined models revealed larger differences between risk groups in the validation cohort than with clinical models for LC, RC and DFS. For DMFS, the differences were similar to the clinical model.
CONCLUSION: For prediction of HNC treatment outcomes, image-biomarkers performed as good as or slightly better than clinical variables."

Diagnosis is commonly performed with magnetic resonance imaging. Survival biomarkers are challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumor types. 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumors were recruited into this study. All participants had perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging performed at diagnosis. Imaging data were processed using conventional methods, and a Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand differences in imaging features. Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumors with different survival characteristics (p < 0.01), which were subsequently classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Analysis of high-grade tumors showed a marked difference in survival (p = 0.029) between the two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features. This study has developed a novel model of survival for pediatric brain tumors. Tumor perfusion plays a key role in determining survival and should be considered as a high priority for future imaging protocols."

However, previous deep learning studies have utilized single-center data and limited acquisition parameters.
PURPOSE: Develop a generalizable CNN for lung segmentation in 1 H-MRI, robust to pathology, acquisition protocol, vendor, and center.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: A total of 809 1 H-MRI scans from 258 participants with various pulmonary pathologies (median age (range): 57 (6-85); 42% females) and 31 healthy participants (median age (range): 34 (23-76); 34% females) that were split into training (593 scans (74%); 157 participants (55%)), testing (50 scans (6%); 50 participants (17%)) and external validation (164 scans (20%); 82 participants (28%)) sets.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5-T and 3-T/3D spoiled-gradient recalled and ultrashort echo-time 1 H-MRI.
ASSESSMENT: 2D and 3D CNNs, trained on single-center, multi-sequence data, and the conventional spatial fuzzy c-means (SFCM) method were compared to manually delineated expert segmentations. Each method was validated on external data originating from several centers. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average boundary Hausdorff distance (Average HD), and relative error (XOR) metrics to assess segmentation performance.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed significances of differences between acquisitions in the testing set. Friedman tests with post hoc multiple comparisons assessed differences between the 2D CNN, 3D CNN, and SFCM. Bland-Altman analyses assessed agreement with manually derived lung volumes. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The 3D CNN significantly outperformed its 2D analog and SFCM, yielding a median (range) DSC of 0.961 (0.880-0.987), Average HD of 1.63 mm (0.65-5.45) and XOR of 0.079 (0.025-0.240) on the testing set and a DSC of 0.973 (0.866-0.987), Average HD of 1.11 mm (0.47-8.13) and XOR of 0.054 (0.026-0.255) on external validation data.
DATA CONCLUSION: The 3D CNN generated accurate 1 H-MRI lung segmentations on a heterogenous dataset, demonstrating robustness to disease pathology, sequence, vendor, and center.

This study focuses on test-retest repeatability while assessing inter- and intraobserver variability. T2w STIR and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) are the most widely used cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques to image oedema and infarction, respectively. However, no consensus exists on the best quantification method to be used to analyse these images. This has potential important implications in the research setting where both myocardial oedema and infarct size are increasingly used and measured as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients day 2 following acute reperfused STEMI were scanned for myocardial oedema and infarction (LGE). All patients had a second CMR scan on the same day >6 h apart from the first one. Images were analysed offline by two independent observers using the semi-automated software. Both oedema and LGE were quantified using seven techniques (2 SD, 3 SD, 5 SD, Otsu, FWHM, manual threshold, and manual contouring). Interobserver, intraobserver and test-retest agreement and variability for both infarct size and oedema quantification were assessed. Infarct size and myocardial quantification vary depending on the quantification method used. Overall, manual contouring provided the lowest inter-, intraobserver, and interscan variability for both infarct size and oedema quantification. The FWHM method for infarct size quantification and the Otsu method for myocardial oedema quantification are acceptable alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: This study determines that, in acute myocardial infarction (MI), manual contouring has the lowest overall variability for quantification of both myocardial oedema and MI when analysed by experienced observers."

METHODS: Harmonized MRI acquisition protocols from six participating sites and two different vendors were compared using both physical and human phantoms. We assessed variability across sites and time points by evaluating various phantoms and data including hippocampal volume, diffusion metrics, and resting-state fMRI, from two healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: We report average coefficients of variation (CV) below 5% for intrascanner, intravendor, and intervendor reproducibility for both structural and diffusion imaging metrics, except for diffusion metrics obtained from tractography with average CVs ranging up to 7.8%. Additionally, resting-state fMRI showed stable temporal SNR and reliable generation of subjects DMN across vendors and time points.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the presented multi-site MRI acquisition protocol can be used in a longitudinal study design and that pooling of the acquired data as part of the phase III longitudinal HA-PCI project is possible with careful monitoring of the results of the half-yearly QA assessment to follow-up on potential scanner-related longitudinal changes in image quality."

Understanding potentially modifiable risk factors for vascular disease can help design long-term intervention strategies for controlling or preventing cognitive dysfunction attributable to cerebrovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence and severity of markers of cerebrovascular pathology, its relationship to diagnostic categories of dementia, including AD, and association with the metabolic biomarker homocysteine.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study, 340 community-dwelling elders received a clinical evaluation including brain MRI and neuropsychological tests. Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were diagnosed by consensus committee. Fasting total plasma homocysteine was measured. Statistical analyses were adjusted for demographics and cerebrovascular risk factors.
RESULTS: Nearly 25% of those diagnosed with AD had small vessel infarcts (SVI). Periventricular white matter hyperintensity (pvWMHI) was prevalent in participants with AD (61%) or MCI (amnesic 61% and non-amnesic 54%, respectively). Participants with SVI and/or pvWMHI also had greater brain atrophy. Homocysteine concentrations were higher in individuals with cerebrovascular findings than in those without. In individuals with cerebrovascular disease, homocysteine was inversely related to executive function (p = 0.022) and directly related to degree of brain atrophy (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a significant prevalence of small vessel markers of cerebrovascular pathology in individuals diagnosed with AD, with a significant concurrence between cerebrovascular disease and brain and ventricular atrophy. While current research on AD has focused on amyloid-βpeptide deposition, tau-pathology, and microglial activation and inflammation, greater attention to the cerebrovascular contribution to this neurodegenerative disease presents an additional target for therapeutic prevention and intervention."

To date, it remains unknown whether obesity-associated brain structural alterations are under a similar level of genetic control.
METHODS: For this study, we utilized magnetic resonance imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate associations between body mass index (BMI) and regional gray matter volume (GMV) in a sample of 875 young adults with a wide BMI range (386 males/489 females; age 28.8±3.7 years; BMI 26.6±5.3 kg m-2) that included 86 pairs of monozygotic twins and 82 pairs of dizygotic twins. Twin data were analyzed by applying the additive genetic, common environmental and residual effects model to determine heritability of brain regions that were associated with BMI.
RESULTS: We observed positive associations between BMI and GMV in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right cerebellum and widespread negative associations within the prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobes and distinct subcortical structures. Varying degrees of heritability were found for BMI-associated brain regions, with the highest heritability estimates for cerebellar GMV and subcortical structures.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that brain regions associated with obesity are subject to differing levels of genetic control and environmental influences. Specific brain regions with high heritability might represent an inherent vulnerability factor for obesity."

An independent cohort of patients comprised the independent test set. For both time points and both sets, radiomic features were extracted from two-dimensional manual segmentation (MS), three-dimensional (3D) MS, and from bounding boxes. Radiomics predictive models of DFS were built using a hyperparameters-tuned random forests classifier. Additionally, radiomics models were compared with qualitative parameters, including sphincter invasion, extramural vascular invasion as determined by MRI (mrEMVI) at baseline, and tumour regression grade evaluated by MRI (mrTRG) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
RESULTS: In the training cohort of 98 patients, all three models showed good performance with mean(s.d.) area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.77(0.09) to 0.89(0.09) for prediction of DFS. The 3D radiomics model outperformed qualitative analysis based on mrEMVI and sphincter invasion at baseline (P = 0.038 and P = 0.027 respectively), and mrTRG after CRT (P = 0.017). In the independent test cohort of 48 patients, at baseline and after CRT the AUC ranged from 0.67(0.09) to 0.76(0.06). All three models showed no difference compared with qualitative analysis in the independent set.
CONCLUSION: Radiomics models can predict DFS in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."

A paleopathological and paleoepidemiological study,"Goycoolea MV, Castro M, Galvez M, Montoya C, Fuentes J, Silva-Pinto V.",Acta Otolaryngol. 2019 Apr;139(4):340-344. doi: 10.1080/00016489.2018.1530800. Epub 2019 Feb 22.,Goycoolea MV,Acta Otolaryngol,2019,2019/02/23,,,10.1080/00016489.2018.1530800,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates otitis media in prehistoric populations in northern Chile.
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: Determining prevalence of otitis media and diagnostic usefulness of temporal-bone X-rays in skulls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 444 skulls belonging to three groups: prehistoric-coastal (400-1000 AD), prehistoric-highland (400-1000 AD) and Pisagua-Regional Developments (1000-1450 AD). Skulls were evaluated visually and with Schuller's view X-rays. Five skulls diagnosed as having had otitis media, five diagnosed as normal, and one with temporal bone fistula also had a computed tomography (CT).
RESULTS: Changes suggestive of otitis media were present in Prehistoric-coastal 53.57%; Pisagua-Regional Developments 70.73%; prehistoric-highlands 47.90%. Diagnostic effectiveness of Schuller's view X-rays for assesing middle ear disease was confirmed by CT studies. The case with temporal bone fistula had changes suggestive of mastoiditis and possible post auricular abscess.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a high prevalence of otitis media in prehistoric populations in Chile. The higher prevalence in one group was presumably due to racial factors. Temporal-bone X-rays are effective for massive evaluation of ear disease in skulls. A case of mastoiditis with temporal bone fistula and possible post-auricular abscess is documented.
SIGNIFICANCE: Documenting racial factors in otitis media. Validating X-rays for massive evaluation of otitis media in skulls."

Epub 2016 Aug 9.,Matsuki R,Surgery,2016,2016/08/14,,,10.1016/j.surg.2016.06.041,"BACKGROUND: The feasibility of parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy has yet to be assessed based on the tumor location, which affects the choice of treatment in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
METHODS: Sixty-three patients underwent first curative hepatectomy for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases whose center was located >30 mm from the liver surface. Operative outcomes were compared among patients who underwent parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy or major hepatectomy (≥3 segments).
RESULTS: Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy and major hepatectomy were performed for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases in 40 (63%) and 23 (37%) patients, respectively. Resection time was longer in the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy than in the major hepatectomy group (57 vs 39 minutes) (P = .02) and cut-surface area was wider (120 vs 86 cm2) (P &lt; .01). Resected volume was smaller in the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy than in the major hepatectomy group (251 vs 560 g) (P &lt; .01). No differences were found between the 2 groups for total operation time (306 vs 328 minutes), amount of blood loss (516 vs 400 mL), rate of major complications (10% vs 13%), and positive operative margins (5% vs 4%). Overall, recurrence-free, and liver recurrence-free survivals did not differ between the 2 groups. Direct major hepatectomy without portal venous embolization could not have been performed in 40% of the parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy group (16/40) because of the small liver remnant volume.
CONCLUSION: Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy for deep-placed colorectal liver metastases was performed safely without compromising oncologic radicality. Parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy can increase the number of patients eligible for an operation by halving the resection volume and by increasing the chance of direct operative treatment in patients with ill-located colorectal liver metastases."

The predictive performance of this model was compared with the international prognostic index (IPI) and 2 models incorporating radiomic PET/CT features (clinical PET and PET models). Methods: In total, 1,132 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients were included: 296 for training and 836 for external validation. The primary outcome was 2-y time to progression. The deep learning model was trained on maximum-intensity projections from PET/CT scans. The clinical PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, SUV<sub>peak</sub>, age, and performance status. The PET model included metabolic tumor volume, maximum distance from the bulkiest lesion to another lesion, and SUV<sub>peak</sub> Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: The IPI yielded an AUC of 0.60 on all external data. The deep learning model yielded a significantly higher AUC of 0.66 (P &lt; 0.01). For each individual clinical trial, the model was consistently better than IPI. Radiomic model AUCs remained higher for all clinical trials. The deep learning and clinical PET models showed equivalent performance (AUC, 0.69; P &gt; 0.05). The PET model yielded the highest AUC of all models (AUC, 0.71; P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The deep learning model predicted outcome in all trials with a higher performance than IPI and better survival curve separation. This model can predict treatment outcome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without tumor delineation but at the cost of a lower prognostic performance than with radiomics."

Occasionally distant non-enhancing lesions may be identified which have the appearances of a multicentric low-grade glioma. We aimed to determine the incidence, prognostic significance and diagnostic value of this appearance in new glioblastoma patients. Pre-operative MRIs of patients with a new diagnosis of glioblastoma were reviewed to identify multicentric non-enhancing lesions, defined as areas of FLAIR hyperintensity and mass effect, without post-contrast enhancement, separate from the histologically-proven glioblastoma. Patient survival was compared to glioblastoma patients without these appearances, and follow-up imaging was reviewed. Nine of 151 patients (6 %) had multicentric non-enhancing lesions. Their median survival of 183 days was significantly worse than the 278 days for patients without multicentric nonenhancing lesions (p = 0.025). Follow-up MRIs were performed in four patients. In one patient, there were several additional lesions, one of which developed evidence of necrosis within 22 days of presentation. In the other three patients, the multicentric lesions developed enhancement and evidence of necrosis within 1 year, and became confluent on FLAIR with the dominant lesion. The appearance of a multicentric non-enhancing lesion is an uncommon finding in glioblastoma, but a poor prognostic feature. These lesions progress faster than expected for a low-grade glioma and are thus likely to represent more advanced lesions than their appearances suggest. Confluence with the dominant lesion developing with time suggests that the tumor is more extensive than appreciated on imaging."

Knowledge of MVI status would help guide treatment recommendations, but is generally identified after operation. This study aims to predict MVI preoperatively using quantitative image analysis.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and twenty patients from 2 institutions underwent resection of HCC from 2003 to 2015 were included. The largest tumor from preoperative CT was subjected to quantitative image analysis, which uses an automated computer algorithm to capture regional variation in CT enhancement patterns. Quantitative imaging features by automatic analysis, qualitative radiographic descriptors by 2 radiologists, and preoperative clinical variables were included in multivariate analysis to predict histologic MVI.
RESULTS: Histologic MVI was identified in 19 (37%) patients with tumors ≤5 cm and 34 (49%) patients with tumors >5 cm. Among patients with tumors ≤5 cm, none of the clinical findings or radiographic descriptors were associated with MVI; however, quantitative features based on angle co-occurrence matrix predicted MVI with an area under curve of 0.80, positive predictive value of 63%, and negative predictive value of 85%. In patients with tumors >5 cm, higher α-fetoprotein level, larger tumor size, and viral hepatitis history were associated with MVI, and radiographic descriptors were not. However, a multivariate model combining α-fetoprotein, tumor size, hepatitis status, and quantitative feature based on local binary pattern predicted MVI with area under curve of 0.88, positive predictive value of 72%, and negative predictive value of 96%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the potential importance of quantitative image analysis as a predictor of MVI."

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,Andersson KM,Med Phys,2018,2018/08/05,,,10.1002/mp.13115,"PURPOSE: To evaluate two commercial CT metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithms for use in proton treatment planning in the head and neck (H&N) area.
METHODS: An anthropomorphic head phantom with removable metallic implants (dental fillings or neck implant) was CT-scanned to evaluate the O-MAR (Philips) and the iMAR (Siemens) algorithms. Reference images were acquired without any metallic implants in place. Water equivalent thickness (WET) was calculated for different path directions and compared between image sets. Images were also evaluated for use in proton treatment planning for parotid, tonsil, tongue base, and neck node targets. The beams were arranged so as to not traverse any metal prior to the target, enabling evaluation of the impact on dose calculation accuracy from artifacts surrounding the metal volume. Plans were compared based on γ analysis (1 mm distance-to-agreement/1% difference in local dose) and dose volume histogram metrics for targets and organs at risk (OARs). Visual grading evaluation of 30 dental implant patient MAR images was performed by three radiation oncologists.
RESULTS: In the dental fillings images, ΔWET along a low-density streak was reduced from -17.0 to -4.3 mm with O-MAR and from -16.1 mm to -2.3 mm with iMAR, while for other directions the deviations were increased or approximately unchanged when the MAR algorithms were used. For the neck implant images, ΔWET was generally reduced with MAR but residual deviations remained (of up to -2.3 mm with O-MAR and of up to -1.5 mm with iMAR). The γ analysis comparing proton dose distributions for uncorrected/MAR plans and corresponding reference plans showed passing rates >98% of the voxels for all phantom plans. However, substantial dose differences were seen in areas of most severe artifacts (γ passing rates of down to 89% for some cases). MAR reduced the deviations in some cases, but not for all plans. For a single patient case dosimetrically evaluated, minor dose differences were seen between the uncorrected and MAR plans (γ passing rate approximately 97%). The visual grading of patient images showed that MAR significantly improved image quality (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: O-MAR and iMAR significantly improved image quality in terms of anatomical visualization for target and OAR delineation in dental implant patient images. WET calculations along several directions, all outside the metallic regions, showed that both uncorrected and MAR images contained metal artifacts which could potentially lead to unacceptable errors in proton treatment planning. ΔWET was reduced by MAR in some areas, while increased or unchanged deviations were seen for other path directions. The proton treatment plans created for the phantom images showed overall acceptable dose distributions differences when compared to the reference cases, both for the uncorrected and MAR images. However, substantial dose distribution differences in the areas of most severe artifacts were seen for some plans, which were reduced by MAR in some cases but not all. In conclusion, MAR could be beneficial to use for proton treatment planning; however, case-by-case evaluations of the metal artifact-degraded images are always recommended."

OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the present study was to estimate how large a sample size would be needed for future clinical trials for AD-modifying treatments in Japan using atrophy measures of the brain as a surrogate biomarker.
METHODS: Sample sizes were estimated from the rates of change of the whole brain and hippocampus by the k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and cognitive measures using the data of 537 Japanese Alzheimer's Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI) participants with a linear mixed-effects model. We also examined the potential use of ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy.
RESULTS: The hippocampal atrophy rate required smaller sample sizes than cognitive measures of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Inclusion of ApoE status reduced sample sizes for AD and MCI patients in the atrophy measures.
CONCLUSION: These results show the potential use of longitudinal hippocampal atrophy measurement using automated image analysis as a progression biomarker and ApoE status as a trial enrichment strategy in a clinical trial of AD-modifying treatment in Japanese people."

A systematic literature review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. The search was performed in six primary databases and three databases to cover part of the grey literature. Observational and diagnostic accuracy studies that investigated lip print patterns through cheiloscopy for sexual dimorphism were selected. Risk of bias was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool. Proportion meta-analysis using random effects was fitted to pool the accuracy of cheiloscopy. The odds of correctly identifying males and females was assessed through a random effects meta-analysis. GRADE approach was used to assess certainty of evidence. The search found 3,977 records, published between 1982 and 2019. Seventy-two studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis (n = 22,965 participants), and twenty-two studies were sampled for meta-analysis. Fifty studies had low risk of bias. Suzuki and Tsuchihashi's technique was the most prevalent among studies. The accuracy of sexual dimorphism through cheiloscopy ranged between 52.7 and 93.5%, while the pooled accuracy was 76.8% (95% CI = 65.8; 87.7). There was no difference between the accuracy to identify males or females (OR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.26; 1.99). The large spectrum of studies on sexual dimorphism via cheiloscopy depicted accuracy percentage rates that rise uncertainty and concern. The unclear performance of the technique could lead to wrong forensic practice."

However, few studies have assessed both serum 17β-estradiol (E2) and exogenous hormone therapy (HT) use in relation to oral bone loss.
METHODS: This study examines the associations among serum E2, HT use, and ACH in 613 postmenopausal women from the Buffalo OsteoPerio study. Baseline ACH levels and 5-year ACH were assessed for groups according to E2 level (undetectable, >5.00 to ≤18.00, >18.00 to ≤46.07, and >46.07 pg/mL) and among HT use (never, ever) using analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of ACH loss with serum E2 and HT use.
RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, no association was found of serum E2 with whole-mouth mean or worst-site ACH. However, history of HT use was associated with ACH. Women who had never used HT had more ACH loss assessed as a whole-mouth mean ACH (P = 0.01) and as worst-site ACH loss (P = 0.03). In logistic regression analyses of baseline ACH loss severity, HT never-users had two-fold higher odds of being in the severe ACH loss category compared to ever-users (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 3.62). No association was observed of 5-year change in ACH with baseline serum E2 or HT use.
CONCLUSION: Although this study did not detect an association with current serum E2 level and ACH, HT use was found to be associated with less ACH loss in postmenopausal women."

Kirschner wires were placed under the guidance of navigation's screw view mode. The position of the screws was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scan postoperatively. Fracture dislocation of sacroiliac joint was measured in axial, sagittal, and coronal views of 3 dimensional (3D) CT images preoperatively, postoperatively and at the last follow-up visit. The duration of trajectory planning, guide wire implantation time, screw placement time, intraoperative blood loss, and incidence of screw loosening and clinical complications were also assessed.A total of 27 screws were placed unilaterally or bilaterally into segments S1 or S2. Screw placement was rated as excellent for 88.9% of screws (n = 24), good for 7.4% (n = 2), and poor for 3.7% (n = 1). Preoperatively, the average fracture dislocation of sacroiliac joint on axial, sagittal, and coronal views was 14.3 mm, 9.6 mm, and 7.4 mm, respectively, and the corresponding postoperative figures were 5.6 mm, 3.2 mm, 4.1 mm, respectively. The corresponding correction rates were 60.8%, 66.7%, and 44.6%, respectively. The mean duration of trajectory planning was 6.5 min (2.7-8.9 min). Mean screw implantation time was 32 min (range, 20-53 min), and the mean guide wire implantation time was 3.7 min (range, 2.1-5.3 min). No clinical complications such as neurovascular injury, infection or screw loosening were observed on follow-up.The PSS placement under guidance of screw view model of navigation is a convenient, safe and reliable method."

However, the predictive value of manual PD-L1 scoring is imperfect and alternative measures are needed. We report an automated image analysis solution to determine the predictive and prognostic values of the product of PD-L1+ cell and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) densities (CD8xPD-L1 signature) in baseline tumor biopsies.
METHODS: Archival or fresh tumor biopsies were analyzed for PD-L1 and CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry. Samples were collected from 163 patients in Study 1108/NCT01693562, a Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate durvalumab across multiple tumor types, including NSCLC, and a separate cohort of 199 non-ICT- patients. Digital images were automatically scored for PD-L1+ and CD8+ cell densities using customized algorithms applied with Developer XD™ 2.7 software.
RESULTS: For patients who received durvalumab, median overall survival (OS) was 21.0 months for CD8xPD-L1 signature-positive patients and 7.8 months for signature-negative patients (p = 0.00002). The CD8xPD-L1 signature provided greater stratification of OS than high densities of CD8+ cells, high densities of PD-L1+ cells, or manually assessed tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥25%. The CD8xPD-L1 signature did not stratify OS in non-ICT patients, although a high density of CD8+ cells was associated with higher median OS (high: 67 months; low: 39.5 months, p = 0.0009) in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: An automated CD8xPD-L1 signature may help to identify NSCLC patients with improved response to durvalumab therapy. Our data also support the prognostic value of CD8+ TILS in NSCLC patients who do not receive ICT.

Epub 2019 Jan 23.,Scicluna MT,J Virol Methods,2019,2019/01/27,,,10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.01.012,"Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a blood borne disease that is listed among the notifiable diseases of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). EIA is also regulated by the OIE for the international trading provisions and is generally subject to control programmes. Since 2011, Italy has been conducting a surveillance plan based on a three-tier diagnostic system, using a serological ELISA as screening test, an agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGIDT) as a confirmatory method, and an immunoblot (IB) as an alternative confirmatory assay for discordant results between the first two tests. As for the in-house competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) and the AGIDT, the Italian National Reference Laboratory for EIA (NRL) validated the IB according to the OIE guidelines, employing eight panels containing positive sera, including those from EIA virus (EIAV) proven infected horses, and negative horse, mule and donkey sera collected from different geographical areas. In addition, two international reference image panels were employed for the optimization and the validation of the digital image reading system adopted that allows an impartial measurement of the serum reactivity in the IB assay. The immunological reactivity to EIAV antigens, p26, gp45 and gp90 adsorbed on the IB membrane, determines the serological status of the animal and for EIA, a p26 positive band together with at least one of the other antigen defines a subject as serologically positive for EIAV. For validation, the parameters assessed were threshold values, analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, repeatability and reproducibility. These parameters were evaluated for each antigen as well as in combination, according to the diagnostic algorithm established above. The validation data defined the IB as having a satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, repeatability and reproducibility for all antigens and species tested. An instrumental recording of the results improves the confidence in using IB as a confirmatory test for EIAV, differently from the AGIDT that is read by an operator. The advantages of using the IB are its higher sensitivity, to that of the AGIDT, which allows an earlier detection of infection that reduces the risk of transmission and therefore the incidence of the EIA, and its higher specificity to that of the ELISA which is based on the discrimination of subjects reacting only against the p26, the antigen used by all ELISAs available, which are not considered as infected by EIAV. In particular, when this assay is used in outbreaks it can detect new cases earlier than the AGIDT, and therefore reduce the restriction period with an economic benefit for the animal owners and the public veterinary sanitary system."

This difference is mainly explained by a higher rate of dislocation revisions. Cup malpositioning is a risk factor for dislocation and, being made of a highly porous material, Continuum cups might be more difficult to position. We evaluated whether Continuum cups had worse cup positioning compared with other uncemented cups. Patients and methods - Based on power calculation, 150 Continuum cups from 1 center were propensity score matched with 150 other uncemented cups from 4 centers. All patients had an uncemented stem, femoral head size of 32 mm or 36 mm, and BMI between 19 and 35. All operations were done for primary osteoarthrosis through a posterior approach. Patients were matched using age, sex, and BMI. Cup positioning was measured from anteroposterior pelvic radiograph using the Martell Hip Analysis Suite software. Results - There was no clinically relevant difference in mean inclination angle between the study group and the control group (43° [95% CI 41-44] and 43° [CI 42-45], respectively). The study group had a larger mean anteversion angle compared with the control group, 19° (CI 18-20) and 17° (CI 15-18) respectively. Interpretation - Continuum cups had a greater anteversion compared with the other uncemented cups. However, the median anteversion was acceptable in both groups and this difference does not explain the larger dislocation rate in the Continuum cups observed in earlier studies."

Methods: A total of 60 patients with advanced HCC (BCLC stage C) treated with apatinib plus TACE were divided into a training set (n=48) and a validation set (n=12). The predictors identified from the clinical variables and the radiomics signature constructed from the computed tomography images, such as ɑ-fetoprotein level (AFP), formfactor, the grey level co-occurrence matrix, the gray level size zone matrix, and the gray level run-length matrix, were used to build the clinical-radiomics nomograms and the radiomics nomograms for the prediction of OS and TTP. Results: Apatinib plus TACE benefited the patients with advanced HCC, with a 579-day median OS and a 270-day median TTP. The nomograms were built with the radiomics signature and AFP, and achieved favorable prediction efficacy with acceptable calibration curves. Decision curve analyses demonstrated that the clinical-radiomics nomograms outperformed the radiomics nomograms for the predictions of OS and TTP. Conclusions: Apatinib plus TACE may improve OS and prolonged TTP in the patients with advanced HCC. The clinical-radiomics nomograms, a noninvasive pretreatment prediction tool that incorporate radiomics signature and AFP, demonstrated good prediction accuracy for OS and TTP in these patients. These results indicate that the clinical-radiomics nomograms may provide novel insight for precise personalized medicine approaches in the patients with advanced HCC."

Epub 2020 Jul 24.,Pérez-Benito FJ,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2020,2020/08/07,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105668,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. The Spanish healthcare network established population-based screening programs in all Autonomous Communities, where mammograms of asymptomatic women are taken with early diagnosis purposes. Breast density assessed from digital mammograms is a biomarker known to be related to a higher risk to develop breast cancer.It is thus crucial to provide a reliable method to measure breast density from mammograms. Furthermore the complete automation of this segmentation process is becoming fundamental as the amount of mammograms increases every day. Important challenges are related with the differences in images from different devices and the lack of an objective gold standard.This paper presents a fully automated framework based on deep learning to estimate the breast density. The framework covers breast detection, pectoral muscle exclusion, and fibroglandular tissue segmentation.
METHODS: A multi-center study, composed of 1785 women whose ""for presentation"" mammograms were segmented by two experienced radiologists. A total of 4992 of the 6680 mammograms were used as training corpus and the remaining (1688) formed the test corpus. This paper presents a histogram normalization step that smoothed the difference between acquisition, a regression architecture that learned segmentation parameters as intrinsic image features and a loss function based on the DICE score.
RESULTS: The results obtained indicate that the level of concordance (DICE score) reached by the two radiologists (0.77) was also achieved by the automated framework when it was compared to the closest breast segmentation from the radiologists. For the acquired with the highest quality device, the DICE score per acquisition device reached 0.84, while the concordance between radiologists was 0.76.
CONCLUSIONS: An automatic breast density estimator based on deep learning exhibits similar performance when compared with two experienced radiologists. It suggests that this system could be used to support radiologists to ease its work."

We compared global cerebral blood flow measurements obtained using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling and phase contrast in 436 middle-aged subjects acquired at two sites in the NHLBI CARDIA multisite study. Cerebral blood flow measured by phase contrast (CBFPC: 55.76 ± 12.05 ml/100 g/min) was systematically higher (p < 0.001) and more variable than cerebral blood flow measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (CBFPCASL: 47.70 ± 9.75). The correlation between global cerebral blood flow values obtained from the two modalities was 0.59 (p < 0.001), explaining less than half of the observed variance in cerebral blood flow estimates. Well-established correlations of global cerebral blood flow with age and sex were similarly observed in both CBFPCASL and CBFPC CBFPC also demonstrated statistically significant site differences, whereas no such differences were observed in CBFPCASL No consistent velocity-dependent effects on pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling were observed, suggesting that pseudo-continuous labeling efficiency does not vary substantially across typical adult carotid and vertebral velocities, as has previously been suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CBFPCASL and CBFPC values show substantial similarity across the entire cohort, these data do not support calibration of CBFPCASL using CBFPC in individual subjects. The wide-ranging cerebral blood flow values obtained by both methods suggest that cerebral blood flow values are highly variable in the general population."

Our aim was to determine a neural substrate that could be used to distinguish BD from MDD. Our study included a BD group (10 patients with BD, 10 first-degree relatives (FDRs) of individuals with BD), MDD group (17 patients with MDD, 17 FDRs of individuals with MDD), and 27 healthy individuals. Structural and functional brain abnormalities were evaluated by voxel-based morphometry and a trail making test (TMT), respectively. The BD group showed a significant main effect of diagnosis in the gray matter (GM) volume of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; p = 0.01) and left insula (p < 0.01). FDRs of individuals with BD showed significantly smaller left ACC GM volume than healthy subjects (p < 0.01), and patients with BD showed significantly smaller ACC (p < 0.01) and left insular GM volume (p < 0.01) than healthy subjects. The MDD group showed a tendency toward a main effect of diagnosis in the right and left insular GM volume. The BD group showed a significantly inverse correlation between the left insular GM volume and TMT-A scores (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the ACC volume could be a distinct endophenotype of BD, while the insular volume could be a shared BD and MDD endophenotype. Moreover, the insula could be associated with cognitive decline and poor outcome in BD."

METHODS: Specific planning software (SimPlant(®) OMS Standalone 14.0) was used to perform a 3D virtual Le Fort I osteotomy in 10 fresh human cadaver heads. Stereolithographic splints were then generated and used during the surgical procedure to reposition the maxilla according to the planned position. Pre-operative planned and postoperative 3D CT scan images were fused and imported to dedicated software (MATLAB(®)) 7.11.) for calculating the translational and rotational (pitch, roll and yaw) differences between the two 3D images. Geometrical accuracy was estimated using the Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) and lower and upper limits of accuracy were computed using the Bland & Altman method, with 95 % confidence intervals around the limits. The accuracy cutoff was set at +/- 2 mm for translational and ≤ 4° for rotational measurements.
RESULTS: Overall accuracy between the two 3D images was within the accuracy cutoff for all values except for the antero-posterior positioning of the maxilla (2.17 mm). The translational and rotational differences due to the splint were all within the accuracy cutoff. However, the width of the limits of agreement (range between lower and upper limits) showed that rotational differences could be particularly large.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that maxillary repositioning can be accurately approximated and thus predicted by specific computational planning and CAD/CAM generated splints in orthognathic surgery. Further study should focus on the risk factors for inaccurate prediction."

Epub 2017 Oct 13.,Li Q,Clin Lung Cancer,2018,2017/11/16,PMC5825260,NIHMS920996,10.1016/j.cllc.2017.10.002,"RATIONALE: Lung computed tomography (CT) Screening Reporting and Data System (lung-RADS) has standardized follow-up and management decisions in lung cancer screening. To date, little is known how lung-RADS classification compares with radiological semantic features in risk prediction and diagnostic discrimination.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of radiological semantic features and lung-RADS in predicting nodule malignancy in lung cancer screening.
METHODS: We used data and low-dose CT (LDCT) images from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The training cohort contained 60 patients with screen-detected incident lung cancers who had a positive baseline screen (T0) that was not diagnosed and then was diagnosed at second follow-up (T2), and 139 nodule-positive controls who had 3 consecutive positive screens (T0 to T2) that were not diagnosed as lung cancer. The testing cohort included 40 patients with incident lung cancers that were diagnosed at first follow-up (T1) and 40 nodule-positive controls. Twenty-four semantic features were scored on a point scale from the LDCT images. Multivariable linear predictor model was built on the semantic features and the performances were compared with lung-RADS in 3 screening rounds. We also combined non-size-based semantic features with lung-RADS to improve malignancy detection.
RESULTS: At T0, the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for border definition in risk prediction was 0.72. The average AUROC for contour at T1 in risk prediction and T2 in diagnostic discrimination was 0.82 and 0.88, respectively. By comparison, the average AUROC of lung-RADS at T0, T1 and T2 were 0.60, 0.76 and 0.87, respectively. The combined model of the semantic features and lung-RADS shows improvement with AUROCs of 0.74, 0.88 and 0.96 at T0, T1, and T2, respectively, achieved by adding border definition (at T0) or contour (at T1 and T2).
CONCLUSION: We find semantic features defined by border definition and contour performed similar to lung-RADS at follow-up time point and outperformed lung-RADS at baseline. These semantics alongside of lung-RADS shows improved performance to detect malignancy."

METHODS: In 2,011 patients (49.7% female, median age 73 years [61-81]) included between 2009 and 2017, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses regarding the occurrence of FR. FRs were defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 4-6 despite successful recanalization in patients selected by MRI (n = 690) and CT (n = 1,321) with a sensitivity analysis considering only patients with mRS 5-6 as futile.
RESULTS: MRI as compared to CT resulted in similar rates of subsequent MT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.048, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.677-1.624). Rates of FR were as follows: 571/1,489 (38%) FR mRS 4-6 including 393/1,489 (26%) FR mRS 5-6. CT-based selection was associated with increased rates of FRs compared to MRI (44% [41%-47%] vs 29% [25%-32%], p &lt; 0.001; aOR 1.77 [95% CI 1.25-2.51]). These findings were robust in sensitivity analysis. MRI-selected patients had a delay of approximately 30 minutes in workflow metrics in real-world university comprehensive stroke centers. However, functional outcome and mortality were more favorable in patients selected by MRI compared to patients selected with CT.
CONCLUSIONS: CT selection for MT was associated with an increased risk of FRs as compared to MRI selection. Efforts are needed to shorten workflow delays in MRI patients. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the initial imaging modality on FR occurrence and to develop a reliable FR prediction algorithm."

However, it is not well understood owing to the high levels of spatial heterogeneity within tumours, which is difficult to analyse by traditional pathological assessment. This paper describes an unbiased methodology to statistically model the spatial distribution of lymphocytes among tumour cells based on automated analysis of haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole-tumour section images, which is applied to two independent TNBC cohorts of 181 patients with matched microarray gene expression data. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the fusion of image analysis and statistical modelling for an integrative understanding of intratumour heterogeneity of lymphocytic infiltration. Using this methodology, a quantitative measure of intratumour lymphocyte ratio is developed and found to be significantly associated with disease-specific survival in both TNBC cohorts independent to standard clinical parameters. The proposed image-based measure compares favourably to a number of gene expression signatures of immune infiltration. In addition, heterogeneous immune infiltration at the morphological level is reflected at the molecular scale and correlated with increased expression of CTLA4, the target of ipilimumab. Taken together, these results support the fusion of high-throughput image analysis and statistical modelling to offer reproducible and robust biomarkers for the objective identification of patients with poor prognosis and treatment options."

METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 283 undergraduate medical students at a tertiary healthcare center. An electronic survey was conducted to collect the data. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23). The Chi-square test (Fisher's exact test when required) was used to study the significance of associations. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A high prevalence of CVS was observed in which 92% reported at least one symptom while using a digital device, the most frequent being eye strain (49%). Among extraocular complaints, joint pain in the wrist and fingers was most frequent. Significant association (P < 0.05) of CVS was found with increased duration of digital device usage, refractive error, use of glasses or contact lens, preexisting dry eye disease, and use of topical eye drops. 37% of the participants were aware of the 20-20-20 rule, while only 11% followed it.
CONCLUSION: CVS is a common health concern among medical students. Hence, to increase the productivity of work, significant risk factors need to be addressed and awareness must be raised."

This study evaluated the performance of two pipelines: Civet-CLASP (v1.1.9) and Freesurfer (v5.3.0).
METHODS: Images from 185 ADNI1 cases (69 elderly controls (CTR), 37 stable MCI (sMCI), 27 progressive MCI (pMCI), and 52 Alzheimer (AD) patients) scanned at baseline, month 12, and month 24 were processed using the two pipelines and two interconnected e-infrastructures: neuGRID (https://neugrid4you.eu) and VIP (http://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr). The vertex-by-vertex cross-algorithm comparison was made possible applying the 3D gradient vector flow (GVF) and closest point search (CPS) techniques.
RESULTS: The cortical thickness measured with Freesurfer was systematically lower by one third if compared to Civet's. Cross-sectionally, Freesurfer's effect size was significantly different in the posterior division of the temporal fusiform cortex. Both pipelines were weakly or mildly correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE) and the hippocampal volumetry. Civet differed significantly from Freesurfer in large frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions (p<0.05). In a discriminant analysis with cortical ROIs having effect size larger than 0.8, both pipelines gave no significant differences in area under the curve (AUC). Longitudinally, effect sizes were not significantly different in any of the 28 ROIs tested. Both pipelines weakly correlated with MMSE decay, showing no significant differences. Freesurfer mildly correlated with hippocampal thinning rate and differed in the supramarginal gyrus, temporal gyrus, and in the lateral occipital cortex compared to Civet (p<0.05). In a discriminant analysis with ROIs having effect size larger than 0.6, both pipelines yielded no significant differences in the AUC.
CONCLUSIONS: Civet appears slightly more sensitive to the typical AD atrophic pattern at the MCI stage, but both pipelines can accurately characterize the topography of cortical thinning at the dementia stage."

We prospectively assessed structural imaging biomarkers differentiating patients who develop seizures secondary to TBI from patients who do not.
DESIGN: Multicentre prospective cohort study starting in 2018. Imaging data are acquired around day 14 post-injury, detection of seizure events occurred early (within 1 week) and late (up to 90 days post-TBI).
RESULTS: From a sample of 96 patients surviving moderate-to-severe TBI, we performed shape analysis of local volume deficits in subcortical areas (analysable sample: 57 patients; 35 no seizure, 14 early, 8 late) and cortical ribbon thinning (analysable sample: 46 patients; 29 no seizure, 10 early, 7 late). Right hippocampal volume deficit and inferior temporal cortex thinning demonstrated a significant effect across groups. Additionally, the degree of left frontal and temporal pole thinning, and clinical score at the time of the MRI, could differentiate patients experiencing early seizures from patients not experiencing them with 89% accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although this is an initial report, these data show that specific areas of localised volume deficit, as visible on routine imaging data, are associated with the emergence of seizures after TBI."

The authors performed a survey of MRI practices among sites participating in a multicenter study of severe pediatric TBI to provide information for designing future clinical trials using MRI to assess brain injury after severe pediatric TBI.
METHODS: Information on current imaging practices and resources was collected from 27 institutions participating in the Approaches and Decisions after Pediatric TBI Trial. Multiple-choice questions addressed the percentage of patients with TBI who have MRI studies, timing of MRI, MRI sequences used to investigate TBI, as well as the magnetic field strength of MR scanners used at the participating institutions and use of standardized MRI protocols for imaging after severe pediatric TBI.
RESULTS: Overall, the reported use of MRI in pediatric patients with severe TBI at participating sites was high, with 40% of sites indicating that they obtain MRI studies in > 95% of this patient population. Differences were observed in the frequency of MRI use between US and international sites, with the US sites obtaining MRI in a higher proportion of their pediatric patients with severe TBI (94% of US vs 44% of international sites reported MRI in at least 70% of patients with severe TBI). The reported timing and composition of MRI studies was highly variable across sites. Sixty percent of sites reported typically obtaining an MRI study within the first 7 days postinjury, with the remainder of responses distributed throughout the first 30-day postinjury period. Responses indicated that MRI sequences sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and ischemia are frequently obtained in patients with TBI, whereas perfusion imaging and spectroscopy techniques are less common.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this survey suggest that despite the lack of consensus or guidelines, MRI is commonly obtained during the acute clinical setting after severe pediatric TBI. The variation in MRI practices highlights the need for additional studies to determine the utility, optimal timing, and composition of clinical MRI studies after TBI. The information in this survey describes current clinical MRI practices in children with severe TBI and identifies important challenges and objectives that should be considered when designing future studies."

This study provides detailed information in low-risk patients both at rest and during exercise.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 90 patients (50 men) with a very low likelihood of coronary artery disease. Gated-SPECT MPI was performed with Tc-99m MIBI using a 2-day protocol, with 16 frames/R-R cycle. The LV ejection fraction and volumes were not different between the rest and post-stress images. LVEF was 68 ± 7% post-stress and 70 ± 7% at rest in women, and 62 ± 7% and 63 ± 7%, respectively, in men (P = .19, .26). LV volumes were larger in men than women (P < .01). There were no differences in most variables obtained at rest or post-stress. Transient ischemic dilatation was similar, with upper limits of 1.20 and 1.19 in women and men, respectively (P = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: These data could prove helpful for the interpretation of gated SPECT MPI data in Latin America using identical protocol as used in this study."

We demonstrate that in vivo central airway branch variants are present in 26.5% of the general population, are unchanged over 10 y, and exhibit strong familial aggregation. The most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD in two cohorts (n = 5,054), with greater central airway bifurcation density, and with emphysema throughout the lung. The second most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD among smokers, with narrower airway lumens in all lobes, and with genetic polymorphisms within the FGF10 gene. We conclude that central airway branch variation, readily detected by computed tomography, is a biomarker of widely altered lung structure with a genetic basis and represents a COPD susceptibility factor."

METHODS: Semi-automatic measurement of arterial and venous width were performed with the aid of Imedos software and conventional fundus examination from the analysis of retinal images belonging to the 976 patients integrated in the cohort Investigating Silent Strokes in Hypertensives: a magnetic resonance imaging study (ISSYS), group of hypertensive patients. All patients have been subjected to a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (RMN) to assess the presence or absence of brain silent infarct.
RESULTS: Retinal images of 768 patients were studied. Among the clinical findings observed, association with ICS was only detected in patients with microaneurysms (OR 2.50; 95% CI: 1.05-5.98) or altered RAV (<0.666) (OR: 4.22; 95% CI: 2.56-6.96). In multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted by age and sex, only altered RAV continued demonstrating as a risk factor (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 2.21-6.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the semiautomatic analysis of the retinal vasculature from retinal images has the potential to be considered as an important vascular risk factor in hypertensive population."

Epub 2021 Apr 15.,Wesdorp NJ,Surg Oncol,2021,2021/04/18,,,10.1016/j.suronc.2021.101578,"BACKGROUND: To better select patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) for an optimal selection of treatment strategy (i.e. local, systemic or combined treatment) new prognostic models are warranted. In the last decade, radiomics has emerged as a field to create predictive models based on imaging features. This systematic review aims to investigate the current state and potential of radiomics to predict clinical outcomes in patients with CRLM.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, according to PRISMA guidelines. Original studies reporting on radiomics predicting clinical outcome in patients diagnosed with CRLM were included. Clinical outcomes were defined as response to systemic treatment, recurrence of disease, and survival (overall, progression-free, disease-free). Primary outcome was the predictive performance of radiomics. A narrative synthesis of the results was made. Methodological quality was assessed using the radiomics quality score.
RESULTS: In 11 out of 14 included studies, radiomics was predictive for response to treatment, recurrence of disease, survival, or a combination of outcomes. Combining clinical parameters and radiomic features in multivariate modelling often improved the predictive performance. Different types of individual features were found prognostic. Noticeable were the contrary levels of heterogeneous and homogeneous features in patients with good response. The methodological quality as assessed by the radiomics quality score varied considerably between studies.
CONCLUSION: Radiomics appears a promising non-invasive method to predict clinical outcome and improve personalized decision-making in patients with CRLM. However, results were contradictory and difficult to compare. Standardized prospective studies are warranted to establish the added value of radiomics in patients with CRLM."

Early identification of suspected mpox cases will assist in mitigating these impacts.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to differentiate mpox lesion images from other skin lesions seen in a sexual health clinic.
METHODS: We used a data set with 2200 images, that included mpox and non-mpox lesions images, collected from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre and web resources. We adopted deep learning approaches which involved 6 different deep learning architectures to train our AI models. We subsequently evaluated the performance of each model using a hold-out data set and an external validation data set to determine the optimal model for differentiating between mpox and non-mpox lesions.
RESULTS: The DenseNet-121 model outperformed other models with an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.928, an accuracy of 0.848, a precision of 0.942, a recall of 0.742, and an F<sub>1</sub>-score of 0.834. Implementation of a region of interest approach significantly improved the performance of all models, with the AUC for the DenseNet-121 model increasing to 0.982. This approach resulted in an increase in the correct classification of mpox images from 79% (55/70) to 94% (66/70). The effectiveness of this approach was further validated by a visual analysis with gradient-weighted class activation mapping, demonstrating a reduction in false detection within the background of lesion images. On the external validation data set, ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121 achieved the highest performance. ResNet-18 achieved an AUC of 0.990 and an accuracy of 0.947, and DenseNet-121 achieved an AUC of 0.982 and an accuracy of 0.926.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated it was possible to use an AI-based image recognition algorithm to accurately differentiate between mpox and common skin lesions. Our findings provide a foundation for future investigations aimed at refining the algorithm and establishing the place of such technology in a sexual health clinic."

However, much of the clinical data is unstructured in the form of radiology reports, while the process of data collection and curation is arduous and time-consuming.
PURPOSE: We utilized a machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP) approach to extract clinical terms from unstructured radiology reports. Additionally, we investigate the prognostic value of the extracted data in predicting all-cause mortality (ACM) in HF patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational cohort study utilized 122,025 thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) reports from 11,808 HF patients obtained between 2008 and 2018. 1,560 CT reports were manually annotated for the presence or absence of 14 radiographic findings, in addition to age and gender. Thereafter, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained, validated and tested to determine the presence or absence of these features. Further, the ability of CNN to predict ACM was evaluated using Cox regression analysis on the extracted features.
RESULTS: 11,808 CT reports were analyzed from 11,808 patients (mean age 72.8 ± 14.8 years; 52.7% (6,217/11,808) male) from whom 3,107 died during the 10.6-year follow-up. The CNN demonstrated excellent accuracy for retrieval of the 14 radiographic findings with area-under-the-curve (AUC) ranging between 0.83-1.00 (F1 score 0.84-0.97). Cox model showed the time-dependent AUC for predicting ACM was 0.747 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.704-0.790) at 30 days.
CONCLUSION: An ML-based NLP approach to unstructured CT reports demonstrates excellent accuracy for the extraction of predetermined radiographic findings, and provides prognostic value in HF patients."

However, standard medical image classification approaches only assess disease presence at the time of acquisition, neglecting the common clinical setting of longitudinal imaging. For slow, progressive eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), patients undergo repeated imaging over time to track disease progression and forecasting the future risk of developing a disease is critical to properly plan treatment. Our proposed Longitudinal Transformer for Survival Analysis (LTSA) enables dynamic disease prognosis from longitudinal medical imaging, modeling the time to disease from sequences of fundus photography images captured over long, irregular time periods. Using longitudinal imaging data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), LTSA significantly outperformed a single-image baseline in 19/20 head-to-head comparisons on late AMD prognosis and 18/20 comparisons on POAG prognosis. A temporal attention analysis also suggested that, while the most recent image is typically the most influential, prior imaging still provides additional prognostic value."

Among others, radiation based treatments such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR BT) have shown good local control rates.
METHODS: We conducted a dose comparison between actually performed HDR BT versus virtually planned SBRT to evaluate the respective clinically relevant radiation exposure to uninvolved liver tissue. Moreover, dose coverage and conformity indices were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 46 treatment sessions (71 lesions, 38 patients) were evaluated. HDR BT was applied in a single fraction with a dose prescription of 1 × 15 Gy. D98 was 17.9 ± 1.3 Gy, D50 was 41.8 ± 8.1 Gy. The SBRT was planned with a prescribed dose of 3 × 12.5 Gy (65%-Isodose), D98 was 50.7 ± 3.1 Gy, D2 was 57.0 ± 2.3 Gy, and D50 was 55.2 ± 2.3 Gy. Regarding liver exposure Vliver10Gy<sub>BT</sub> was compared to Vliver15.9Gy<sub>SBRT</sub>, Vliver16.2Gy<sub>SBRT</sub> (EQD2 equivalent doses), and Vliver20Gy<sub>SBRT</sub> (clinically relevant dose), all results showed significant differences (p &lt; .001). In a case by case analysis Vliver10Gy<sub>BT</sub> was smaller than Vliver20Gy<sub>SBRT</sub> in 38/46 cases (83%). Dmean of the liver was significantly smaller in BT compared to SBRT (p &lt; .001). GTV volume was correlated to the liver exposure and showed an advantage of HDR BT over SBRT in comparison of clinically relevant doses, and for EQD2 equivalent doses. The advantage was more pronounced for greater liver lesions The Conformity Index (CI) was significantly better for BT, while Healthy Tissue Conformity Index (HTCI) and Conformation Number (CN) showed an advantage for SBRT (p &lt; .001).
CONCLUSION: HDR BT can be advantageous in respect of sparing of normal liver tissue as compared to SBRT, while providing excellent target conformity."

To achieve best results of the analysis pipelines, method-dependent hyperparameters need to be optimized. However, complex pipelines often suffer from the fact that calculation of the gradient of the loss function is analytically or computationally infeasible. Therefore, first- or higher-order optimization methods cannot be applied.
METHODS: We developed a new framework for zero-order black-box hyperparameter optimization called HyperHyper, which has a modular architecture that separates hyperparameter sampling and optimization. We also developed a visualization of the loss function based on infimum projection to obtain further insights into the optimization problem.
RESULTS: We applied HyperHyper in three different experiments with different imaging modalities, and evaluated in total more than 400.000 hyperparameter combinations. HyperHyper was used for optimizing two pipelines for cell nuclei segmentation in prostate tissue microscopy images and two pipelines for detection of hepatitis C virus proteins in live cell microscopy data. We evaluated the impact of separating the sampling and optimization strategy using different optimizers and employed an infimum projection for visualizing the hyperparameter space.
CONCLUSIONS: The separation of sampling and optimization strategy of the proposed HyperHyper optimization framework improves the result of the investigated image analysis pipelines. Visualization of the loss function based on infimum projection enables gaining further insights on the optimization process."

METHODS: This is a single center retrospective observational study. Asymptomatic patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy between October 2012 and October 2014 were included. The preoperative assessment included a Doppler and a computed tomographic (CT) scan dating less than 3 months. A neurological examination was performed during the anesthesia consultation and in the 15 days before surgery. An MRI angiography was performed the day before and 3 days after surgery and was analyzed by an independent neuroradiologist. Preoperative analysis focused on the presence of ischemic events at MRI. The type of plaque, the supra aortic trunk lesions, and the quality of the circle of Willis were analyzed using Doppler and CT scanning. Postoperatively, we searched for signs of postoperative ischemic events at MRI.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included (85.4% of men), and the mean age was 72.4 ± 8.3 years. We noted 7 (17.1%) contralateral stenoses (>50%) and 2 (4.9%) contralateral thromboses, 6 (14.6%) vertebral stenoses, and 7 (17.1%) abnormalities of the circle of Willis. The morphological analysis described 6 unstable plaques including 4 ulcerated, 1 pseudodissection, and 1 intraplaque hemorrhage. Preoperatively, we noted the presence of 21 (51.2%) ischemic lesions including 9 (21.9%) multiple lacunar ischemic events and 12 (29.3%) silent arterial territory infarcts. Eversion was performed for all patients except for 6 (14.6%), for whom a bypass was necessary. No deaths or major complications were observed in the 30 postoperative days. Postoperatively, MRI showed 3 (7.3%) asymptomatic recent ischemic strokes, 1 ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, and 2 contralateral (cerebellar and MCA) strokes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asymptomatic significant carotid stenosis show many preoperative SBI indicating a significant embolic risk. It is difficult to conclude about intraoperative embolic risk, but we hope that more data could demonstrate the importance of MRI for the preoperative evaluation of carotid plaques and brain parenchyma, to identify high-risk embolic patients."

The comparison of frontal sinus patterns is an important tool for personal identification. In Cameriere's method, a new personal code number (codC) containing 8 digits was elaborated, based on the measurements of frontal sinus patterns. The present study is an update of this previous work. Digital radiographic images of the skulls of 299 individuals of different nationalities (100 Italians, 99 Kosovars, and 100 Turks) were analyzed, adopting the same maximum-weight dependence tree used in the original work. For comparisons between groups, Fisher exact test and the χ2 test were carried out. The method, applied to different population groups, significantly increases the likelihood of identifying a person by comparison of antemortem and postmortem frontal sinus radiographs. Results demonstrated that the model is more discriminative in identifying individuals of different nationalities."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 47 patients with rGBM were enrolled in a prospective phase II convection-enhanced delivery of an IL4R-targeted immunotoxin (MDNA55-05, NCT02858895). Bidirectional tumor measurements were created by local sites and centrally by an independent radiologic faculty, then standard RANO, iRANO, and mRANO criteria were applied.
RESULTS: A total of 41 of 47 patients (mean age 56 ± 11.7) were evaluable for response. PFS was significantly shorter using standard RANO compared with iRANO (log-rank, P &lt; 0.0001; HR = 0.3) and mRANO (P &lt; 0.0001; HR = 0.3). In patients who died and had confirmed progression on standard RANO, no correlation was observed between PFS and OS (local, P = 0.47; central, P = 0.34). Using iRANO, a weak association was observed between confirmed PFS and OS via local site measurements (P = 0.017), but not central measurements (P = 0.18). A total of 24 of 41 patients (59%) were censored using iRANO and because they lacked confirmation of progression 3 months after initial progression. A strong correlation was observed between mRANO PFS and OS for both local (R2 = 0.66, P &lt; 0.0001) and centrally determined reads (R2 = 0.57, P = 0.0007).
CONCLUSIONS: No correlation between radiographic PFS and OS was observed for standard RANO or iRANO, but a correlation was observed between PFS and OS using the mRANO criteria. Also, the iRANO criteria was difficult to implement due to need to confirm progression 3 months after initial progression, censoring more than half the patients."

The aim of this study was to generate normative data for retinal vessel parameters, and to evaluate the clinical relevance in systemic hypertension.
METHODS: Fundus photographs from 4309 participants of the Gutenberg Health Study were assessed using the 'retinal vessel analyzer' software (IMEDOS). We generated age and sex-specific nomograms in a disease-free subpopulation of 890 participants for determining the central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE), the central retinal venular equivalent, and the arteriovenous ratio (AVR).
RESULTS: Women had higher values of CRAE, central retinal venular equivalent, and AVR than men, and the decrease in measures with increasing age was less steep in women than in men. Systemic hypertension was associated with lower values [odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) referring to area below the 5% percentile] of AVR (men: OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.669-3.490, P < 0.001; women: OR 3.01, 95% CI 2.126-4.268, P < 0.001) and CRAE (men: OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.563-4.326, P < 0.001, women: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.004-4.487, P < 0.001). Both median CRAE and AVR were lower in participants with uncontrolled hypertension (172.28, range 83.05-251.04; and 0.81, range 0.56-1.04) versus those with screening-detected hypertension (175.72, range 101.23-222.09, P < 0.001; and 0.82, range 0.64-1.05, P = 0.001), and versus those with controlled (179.10, range 108.19-221.92, P < 0.001; and 0.84, range 0.60-1.08, P < 0.001) hypertension.
CONCLUSION: The study provides sex and age-specific normative data for retinal vasculature. Persons with untreated or insufficiently treated hypertension are more likely to have retinal vessel equivalents outside the reference range."

The aim of our study was to independently validate this test to predict the risk of progression to HGD/EAC in BE patients with nondysplastic (ND), indefinite for dysplasia and low-grade dysplasia (LGD).
METHODS: A single-blinded, case-control study was conducted to stratify patients with BE as low, intermediate, or high risk for progression to HGD/EAC within 5 years using a previously described risk prediction test. Patients with BE who progressed to HGD/EAC after at least 1 year (n = 58) were matched to patients undergoing surveillance without progression (n = 210, median surveillance 7 years). Baseline biopsies with subspecialist diagnoses of ND, indefinite for dysplasia, or LGD were tested in a blinded manner, and the predictive performance of the test was assessed.
RESULTS: This risk prediction test stratified patients with BE based on progression risk with the high-risk group at 4.7-fold increased risk for HGD/EAC compared with the low-risk group (95% confidence interval 2.5-8.8, P < 0.0001). Prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value at 5 years was 23%. The high-risk class and male sex provided predictive power that was independent of pathologic diagnosis, age, segment length, and hiatal hernia. Patients with ND BE who scored high risk progressed at a higher rate (26%) than patients with subspecialist-confirmed LGD (21.8%) at 5 years.
DISCUSSION: A risk prediction test identifies patients with ND BE who are at high risk for progression to HGD/EAC and may benefit from early endoscopic therapy or increased surveillance."

However, little is known about the test-retest reproducibility of such measures, particularly in the context of multisite studies. Here, we report the reproducibility of automated Freesurfer hippocampal subfields segmentations in 65 healthy elderly enrolled in a consortium of 13 3T MRI sites (five subjects per site). Participants were scanned in two sessions (test and retest) at least one week apart. Each session included two anatomical 3D T1 MRI acquisitions harmonized in the consortium. We evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of subfields segmentation (i) to assess the effects of averaging two within-session T1 images and (ii) to compare subfields with whole hippocampus volume and spatial reliability. We found that within-session averaging of two T1 images significantly improved the reproducibility of all hippocampal subfields but not that of the whole hippocampus. Volumetric and spatial reproducibility across MRI sites were very good for the whole hippocampus, CA2-3, CA4-dentate gyrus (DG), subiculum (reproducibility error∼2% and DICE > 0.90), good for CA1 and presubiculum (reproducibility error ∼ 5% and DICE ∼ 0.90), and poorer for fimbria and hippocampal fissure (reproducibility error ∼ 15% and DICE < 0.80). Spearman's correlations confirmed that test-retest reproducibility improved with volume size. Despite considerable differences of MRI scanner configurations, we found consistent hippocampal subfields volumes estimation. CA2-3, CA4-DG, and sub-CA1 (subiculum, presubiculum, and CA1 pooled together) gave test-retest reproducibility similar to the whole hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the larger hippocampal subfields volume may be reliable longitudinal markers in multisite studies."

Epub 2018 Mar 20.,Kuroda H,J Surg Res,2018,2018/05/29,,,10.1016/j.jss.2018.02.017,"BACKGROUND: Our previous report suggested that fluorescence thoracoscopic anatomical segmentectomy (TAS) using intravenous (IV) indocyanine green (ICG) injection is safe, feasible, and efficacious for identifying segmental boundaries. However, contrast visualization in the conventional indocyanine green mode (CIM) remains relatively obscure in smoking-related comorbidities. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recently released Spectra-A with CIM by simultaneous observation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We postoperatively analyzed captive imaging using histogram counts in 29 patients who underwent TAS and previously reported that Δ indicates the index of visualization obtained by subtraction from its representative illuminated signal quantities of maximum pixels so that light-shade, intensity-removed image signals are obtained.
RESULTS: Sixteen (55.2%) patients were male, and 13 (44.8%) were female. Segmental boundaries were successfully visualized in all patients (100%). The histogram count widths in dim and bright segments with CIM were 13.3 ± 3.8 and 52.5 ± 12.2, and those with Spectra-A were 19.4 ± 6.1 and 118.1 ± 37.4, respectively. The mean value was 4.3-fold higher for ΔSpa-A (61.4 ± 33.2) than for ΔCIM (14.2 ± 8.5) (P < 0.01). In 14 (48.3%) patients, the segmental boundary could not be clearly visualized using CIM but was explicitly identified using Spectra-A.
CONCLUSIONS: Spectra-A is a safe and promising noninvasive alternative like CIM, and more effective because of overcoming the limitation of CIM, but its use should be studied further to determine its usefulness in identifying segmental boundaries."

Epub 2019 Jan 28.,Chow R,Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,2019,2019/01/29,PMC6931729,,10.1111/anec.12629,"BACKGROUND: Current noninvasive risk stratification methods offer limited prediction of arrhythmic events when selecting patients for ICD implantation. Our laboratory has recently developed a signal processing metric called Layered Symbolic Decomposition frequency (LSDf) that quantifies the percentage of hidden QRS wave frequency components in signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) recordings. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether LSDf can be predictive of ventricular arrhythmia or death in an ICD patient cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-two ICD patients were recruited from 2008 to 2009. These were followed for a mean of 8.5 ± 0.4 years for the primary outcome of first appropriately treated ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF) or death. Thirty-four subjects met the primary outcome. LSDf was significantly lower, and 12-lead QRS duration was significantly greater in patients meeting the primary outcome (12.14 ± 3.97% vs. 16.45 ± 3.73%; p = 0.001) and (111.59 ± 14.96 ms vs. 97.69 ± 13.51 ms; p = 0.012) respectively. A 13.25% LSDf threshold (0.74 sensitivity and 0.85 specificity) was selected based on an ROC curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted; patients above the 13.25% threshold demonstrated significantly better survival outcomes (log-rank p < 0.001). In Cox multivariate regression analysis, the LSDf threshold (13.25%) was compared to LVEF (28.5%), 12-lead QRSd (100 ms), age, % male sex, NYHA classification, and antiarrhythmic usage. LSDf was a predictor of the primary outcome (p = 0.005) and an independent predictor for solely ventricular arrhythmia (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Layered Symbolic Decomposition frequency analysis in SAECG recordings may be a viable predictor of negative ICD survival outcomes."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study.
SETTING: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties.
PARTICIPANTS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty.
RESULTS: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5% for every 1% increase in county AA density (p<.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02).
CONCLUSION: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have."

Epub 2020 Dec 1.,Klein S,Clin Cancer Res,2021,2020/12/02,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3596,"PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is tumorigenic and has been associated with a favorable prognosis compared with OPSCC caused by tobacco, alcohol, and other carcinogens. Meanwhile, machine learning has evolved as a powerful tool to predict molecular and cellular alterations of medical images of various sources.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a deep learning-based HPV prediction score (HPV-ps) on regular hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains and assessed its performance to predict HPV association using 273 patients from two different sites (OPSCC; Giessen, n = 163; Cologne, n = 110). Then, the prognostic relevance in a total of 594 patients (Giessen, Cologne, HNSCC TCGA) was evaluated. In addition, we investigated whether four board-certified pathologists could identify HPV association (n = 152) and compared the results to the classifier.
RESULTS: Although pathologists were able to diagnose HPV association from H&amp;E-stained slides (AUC = 0.74, median of four observers), the interrater reliability was minimal (Light Kappa = 0.37; P = 0.129), as compared with AUC = 0.8 using the HPV-ps within two independent cohorts (n = 273). The HPV-ps identified individuals with a favorable prognosis in a total of 594 patients from three cohorts (Giessen, OPSCC, HR = 0.55, P &lt; 0.0001; Cologne, OPSCC, HR = 0.44, P = 0.0027; TCGA, non-OPSCC head and neck, HR = 0.69, P = 0.0073). Interestingly, the HPV-ps further stratified patients when combined with p16 status (Giessen, HR = 0.06, P &lt; 0.0001; Cologne, HR = 0.3, P = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of HPV association in OPSCC using deep learning with help of regular H&E stains may either be used as a single biomarker, or in combination with p16 status, to identify patients with OPSCC with a favorable prognosis, potentially outperforming combined HPV-DNA/p16 status as a biomarker for patient stratification."

Epub 2018 Jun 6.,Pascot R,Ann Vasc Surg,2018,2018/05/18,,,10.1016/j.avsg.2018.02.037,"BACKGROUND: The optimization of medical treatment regularly challenges the role of carotid surgery for asymptomatic patients. Current research seeks to determine which of these patients will benefit most from surgery. The goal of this study was to identify in a multicenter study, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the risk factors for postoperative silent cerebral ischemic lesions after carotid surgery for asymptomatic stenosis.
METHODS: The multicenter, retrospective study included patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis suitable for surgical treatment and who did not have a history of cerebral ischemia. A diffusion MRI scan was performed the day before and in the 3 days after the procedure. An analysis by an independent neuroradiologist determined the presence of preoperative silent ischemia and the appearance of new lesions postoperatively. The analysis also took into account the plaque type, lesions of supra-aortic trunks, the circle of Willis, the type of surgery, and anesthesia, shunt use, and clamp time.
RESULTS: Between April 2011 and November 2015, 141 patients were included. The mean degree of carotid stenosis in the patients who underwent surgery was 78.2% ± 6.5, with 9 (6.4%) cases of contralateral stenosis ≥70% and 6 (4.3%) of which were thrombosis. The circle of Willis was incomplete in 23 (16.3%) patients. Twenty-one (14.9%) plaques were of high embolic risk. The preoperative MRI found 34 (24.1%) patients with embolic ischemic lesions. The majority of procedures were eversions performed under general anesthesia, 7 (5%) required a shunt, and the mean clamp time was 39 ± 16 min. The postoperative MRI revealed that 10 (7%) patients had a new ischemic lesion on the operated side. None of these lesions were symptomatic. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors for appearance of a new ischemic lesion on the operated side were significant severe stenosis of the vertebral artery ipsilateral to the lesion (odds ratio [OR] = 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] [2.1-39.8], P = 0.003) and insertion of a shunt (OR = 9.1, 95% CI [1.1-73.1], P = 0.039). The 30-day follow-up showed one death at D4 due to hemorrhagic stroke on the operated side and one contralateral stroke. None of the study patients had a myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, the rate of silent ischemic lesions in asymptomatic carotid surgery showed 43.3% of preoperative silent ischemic lesions and 9.2% of new silent lesions after surgery. The use of a shunt and presence of ipsilateral vertebral stenosis are risk factors for perioperative embolism."

Manual scoring of IHC images represents a logistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming. Since the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the application of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of protein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual scoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories and in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is crowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd. The aim of this study is to quantify IHC images for labeling of ER status with two different crowdsourcing approaches, image-labeling and nuclei-labeling, and compare their performance with automated methods. Crowdsourcing- derived scores obtained greater concordance with the pathologist interpretations for both image-labeling and nuclei-labeling tasks (83% and 87%), as compared to the pathologist concordance achieved by the automated method (81%) on 5,338 TMA images from 1,853 breast cancer patients. This analysis shows that crowdsourcing the scoring of protein expression in IHC images is a promising new approach for large scale cancer molecular pathology studies."

We applied longitudinal resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate functional brain connections relevant for disease progression and diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: We used two-center resting state fMRI data of 20 AD patients (65.1±8.0 years), 12 bvFTD patients (64.7±5.4 years), and 22 control subjects (63.8±5.0 years) at baseline and 1.8-year follow-up. We used whole-network and voxel-based network-to-region analyses to study group differences in functional connectivity at baseline and follow-up, and longitudinal changes in connectivity within and between groups.
RESULTS: At baseline, connectivity between paracingulate gyrus and executive control network, between cuneal cortex and medial visual network, and between paracingulate gyrus and salience network was higher in AD compared with controls. These differences were also present after 1.8 years. At follow-up, connectivity between angular gyrus and right frontoparietal network, and between paracingulate gyrus and default mode network was lower in bvFTD compared with controls, and lower compared with AD between anterior cingulate gyrus and executive control network, and between lateral occipital cortex and medial visual network. Over time, connectivity decreased in AD between precuneus and right frontoparietal network and in bvFTD between inferior frontal gyrus and left frontoparietal network. Longitudinal changes in connectivity between supramarginal gyrus and right frontoparietal network differ between both patient groups and controls.
CONCLUSION: We found disease-specific brain regions with longitudinal connectivity changes. This suggests the potential of longitudinal resting state fMRI to delineate regions relevant for disease progression and for diagnostic accuracy, although no group differences in longitudinal changes in the direct comparison of AD and bvFTD were found."

We aimed to investigate the frequency and risk factors of spontaneous HT in patients who received no therapy between IS onset and the first instance of neurological imaging.
METHODS: We studied spontaneous HT using the China National Stroke Registry. Spontaneous HT was diagnosed on an initial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan within 14 days of IS onset. The risk factors associated with spontaneous HT were assessed using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 12,415 patients were diagnosed with IS, and among them, 114 (0.92%) had spontaneous HT. Multivariate analysis revealed that being female odds ratio (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.52-3.44, p < 0.0001), excess alcohol consumption (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.20-3.94, p = 0.0109), atrial fibrillation (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.26-3.66, p = 0.0051), and a prolonged period between IS onset and initial imaging (1-7 days: OR, 1.64, 95% CI, 1.11-2.42, p = 0.0131; 7-14 days: OR, 3.12, 95% CI, 1.53-6.40, p = 0.0018) were positively associated with spontaneous HT.
DISCUSSION: Spontaneous HT occurred in 0.92% of the patients with IS in the acute stage. Being female, excess alcohol consumption, atrial fibrillation, and a prolonged period between IS onset and initial imaging were associated with an increased risk of spontaneous HT."

However, a validation study of digital microscopy is currently lacking in veterinary pathology. The aim of the current study was to validate the usability of digital microscopy in terms of diagnostic accuracy, speed, and confidence for diagnosing and differentiating common canine cutaneous tumor types and to compare it to classical light microscopy. Therefore, 80 histologic sections including 17 different skin tumor types were examined twice as glass slides and twice as digital whole-slide images by 6 pathologists with different levels of experience at 4 time points. Comparison of both methods found digital microscopy to be noninferior for differentiating individual tumor types within the category epithelial and mesenchymal tumors, but diagnostic concordance was slightly lower for differentiating individual round cell tumor types by digital microscopy. In addition, digital microscopy was associated with significantly shorter diagnostic time, but diagnostic confidence was lower and technical quality was considered inferior for whole-slide images compared with glass slides. Of note, diagnostic performance for whole-slide images scanned at 200× magnification was noninferior in diagnostic performance for slides scanned at 400×. In conclusion, digital microscopy differs only minimally from light microscopy in few aspects of diagnostic performance and overall appears adequate for the diagnosis of individual canine cutaneous tumors with minor limitations for differentiating individual round cell tumor types and grading of mast cell tumors."

Neurodegeneration is an important component of multiple sclerosis, which in part accounts for the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Brain atrophy appears to be widespread, although it is becoming increasingly recognized that regional substructure atrophy may be of greater clinical relevance. Patient race (within the limitations of self-identified ancestry) is regarded as an important contributing factor. However, there is a paucity of studies examining differences in neurodegeneration and brain substructure volumes over time in African Americans relative to Caucasian American patients. Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive and reliable tool for measuring structural retinal changes. Recent studies support its utility for tracking neurodegeneration and disease progression in vivo in multiple sclerosis. Relative to Caucasian Americans, African American patients have been found to have greater retinal structural injury in the inner retinal layers. Increased thickness of the inner nuclear layer and the presence of microcystoid macular pathology at baseline predict clinical and radiological inflammatory activity, although whether race plays a role in these changes has not been investigated. Similarly, assessment of outer retinal changes according to race in multiple sclerosis remains incompletely characterized. Twenty-two African Americans and 60 matched Caucasian Americans with multiple sclerosis were evaluated with brain MRI, and 116 African Americans and 116 matched Caucasian Americans with multiple sclerosis were monitored with optical coherence tomography over a mean duration of 4.5 years. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used in statistical analyses. Grey matter (-0.9%/year versus -0.5%: P =0.02), white matter (-0.7%/year versus -0.3%: P =0.04) and nuclear thalamic (-1.5%/year versus -0.7%/year: P =0.02) atrophy rates were approximately twice as fast in African Americans. African Americans also exhibited higher proportions of microcystoid macular pathology (12.1% versus 0.9%, P =0.001). Retinal nerve fibre layer (-1.1% versus -0.8%: P =0.02) and ganglion cell+ inner plexiform layer (-0.7%/year versus -0.4%/year: P =0.01) atrophy rates were faster in African versus Caucasian Americans. African Americans on average exhibited more rapid neurodegeneration than Caucasian Americans and had significantly faster brain and retinal tissue loss. These results corroborate the more rapid clinical progression reported to occur, in general, in African Americans with multiple sclerosis and support the need for future studies involving African Americans in order to identify individual differences in treatment responses in multiple sclerosis."

Methods: Total 33 fetuses were selected from cases evaluated for malformations. Morphological abnormalities were first scanned using 3DUS. MRI was used to confirm the previous preliminary 3DUS findings, and diagnoses were confirmed postnatally. 3DUS scans were performed transabdominally using an Rab (4-8 L) probe, Voluson 730 Pro/Expert and E8 (General Electric, Healthcare, Zipf, Austria). MRI was performed using a 1.5-T scanner (Magneton Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a body coil. The 3D reconstruction of the structure of interest was manually performed from a True FISP sequence using an interactive pen tablet (Syngo multimodality 2009B, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Results: Despite recent advancements in 3DUS, the quality of 3D images obtained from MRI was superior during the third trimester. 3DUS had certain limitations, such as being influenced by the fetal position, the volume of amniotic fluid, and maternal obesity. Fetal movements during image acquisition were one of the main challenges for MRI. Conclusion: The quality of the 3D images obtained using MRI was superior to that of images obtained using US during the third trimester of pregnancy."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A macerated human mandible was scanned optically with an industrial, non-contact, white light scanner, and a three-dimensional (3D) model was obtained, which served as a master model. The mandible was then scanned 10 times by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and the generated 3D surface bone model was virtually compared with the master model. To evaluate the accuracy of the CBCT scans, the standard deviation and the intraclass coefficient were determined.
RESULTS: A total of 19 measurement points in 10 CBCT scans were investigated, and showed an average value of 0.2676 mm with a standard deviation of 0.0593 mm. The standard error of the mean was 0.0043 mm. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) within the 10 CBCT scans was 0.9416.
CONCLUSIONS: This highly precise measuring technology was demonstrated to be appropriate for the evaluation of the accuracy of digital imaging data, down to the micrometric scale. This method is able to exclude human measurement errors, as the software calculates the superimposition and deviation. Thus inaccuracies caused by measurement errors can be avoided. This method provides a highly precise determination of deviations of different CBCT parameters and 3D models for surgical, navigational, and diagnostic purposes. Thus, surgical procedures and the post-operative outcomes can be precisely simulated to benefit the patient."

We developed a pipeline that integrates deep learning on histology specimens with clinical data to predict ICI response in advanced melanoma.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a training cohort from New York University (New York, NY) and a validation cohort from Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN). We built a multivariable classifier that integrates neural network predictions with clinical data. A ROC curve was generated and the optimal threshold was used to stratify patients as high versus low risk for progression. Kaplan-Meier curves compared progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups. The classifier was validated on two slide scanners (Aperio AT2 and Leica SCN400).
RESULTS: The multivariable classifier predicted response with AUC 0.800 on images from the Aperio AT2 and AUC 0.805 on images from the Leica SCN400. The classifier accurately stratified patients into high versus low risk for disease progression. Vanderbilt patients classified as high risk for progression had significantly worse PFS than those classified as low risk (P = 0.02 for the Aperio AT2; P = 0.03 for the Leica SCN400).
CONCLUSIONS: Histology slides and patients' clinicodemographic characteristics are readily available through standard of care and have the potential to predict ICI treatment outcomes. With prospective validation, we believe our approach has potential for integration into clinical practice."

METHODS: A sample of 1266 subjects who were hospitalized due to a SARS-CoV-2 from March-May 2020 were assessed at 8.4 (T1), 13.2 (T2) and 18.3 (T3) months after hospitalization. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to determine anxiety (HADS-A) and depressive (HADS-D) symptoms. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluated sleep quality. Clinical features, onset symptoms and hospital data were collected from medical records.
RESULTS: Sankey plots revealed that the prevalence of anxiety symptomatology (HADS-A ≥ 8 points) was 22.5% (n = 285) at T1, 17.6% (n = 223) at T2, and 7.9% (n = 100) at T3, whereas the prevalence of depressive symptoms (HADS-D ≥ 8 points) was 14.6% (n = 185) at T1, 10.9% (n = 138) at T2, and 6.1% (n = 78) at T3. Finally, the prevalence of poor sleep (PSQI≥8 points) decreased from 32.8% (n = 415) at T1, to 28.8% (n = 365) at T2, and to 24.8% (n = 314) at T3. The recovery curves show a decrease trend visualizing that these symptoms recovered the following years after discharge. The regression models did not reveal medical records associated with anxiety/depressive symptoms or poor sleep.
CONCLUSION: The use of Sankey plots shows a fluctuating evolution of anxiety/depressive symptoms and poor sleep during the first years after the infection. In addition, exponential bar plots revealed a decrease prevalence of these symptoms during the first years after hospital discharge. No risk factors were identified in this cohort."

We sought to determine whether commercially available chest x-ray analysis software meet WHO recommendations for minimal sensitivity and specificity as pulmonary tuberculosis triage tests.
METHODS: We recruited symptomatic adults at the Indus Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. We compared two software, qXR version 2.0 (qXRv2) and CAD4TB version 6.0 (CAD4TBv6), with a reference of mycobacterial culture of two sputa. We assessed qXRv2 using its manufacturer prespecified threshold score for chest x-ray classification as tuberculosis present versus not present. For CAD4TBv6, we used a data-derived threshold, because it does not have a prespecified one. We tested for non-inferiority to preset WHO recommendations (0·90 for sensitivity, 0·70 for specificity) using a non-inferiority limit of 0·05. We identified factors associated with accuracy by stratification and logistic regression.
FINDINGS: We included 2198 (92·7%) of 2370 enrolled participants. 2187 (99·5%) of 2198 were HIV-negative, and 272 (12·4%) had culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. For both software, accuracy was non-inferior to WHO-recommended minimum values (qXRv2 sensitivity 0·93 [95% CI 0·89-0·95], non-inferiority p=0·0002; CAD4TBv6 sensitivity 0·93 [0·90-0·96], p<0·0001; qXRv2 specificity 0·75 [0·73-0·77], p<0·0001; CAD4TBv6 specificity 0·69 [0·67-0·71], p=0·0003). Sensitivity was lower in smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis for both software, and in women for CAD4TBv6. Specificity was lower in men and in those with previous tuberculosis, and reduced with increasing age and decreasing body mass index. Smoking and diabetes did not affect accuracy.
INTERPRETATION: In an HIV-negative population, these software met WHO-recommended minimal accuracy for pulmonary tuberculosis triage tests. Sensitivity will be lower when smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis is more prevalent.

The present study examined whether clearance from choroid plexus of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer, serving as a surrogate marker of a metabolic waste product, is altered in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), one sub-type of dementia. In a prospective observational study of close to healthy individuals (reference cohort; REF) and individuals with iNPH, we performed standardized T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans before and through 24 h after intrathecal administration of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer (the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent gadobutrol). Changes in normalized T1 signal within the choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid of lateral ventricles were quantified using FreeSurfer. The normalized T1 signal increased to maximum within choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid of lateral ventricles 6-9 h after intrathecal gadobutrol in both the REF and iNPH cohorts (enrichment phase). Peak difference in normalized T1 signals between REF and iNPH individuals occurred after 24 h (clearance phase). The results gave evidence for gadobutrol resorption from cerebrospinal fluid by choroid plexus, but with delay in iNPH patients. Whether choroid plexus has a role in iNPH pathogenesis in terms of delayed clearance of amyloid-β remains to be shown."

Growing evidence from population-based studies points to whole-body magnetic resonance imaging's (MRI) enormous potential for quantifying subclinical disease burden and for assessing changes that occur with aging in all organ systems. The Aging Imageomics Study aims to identify biomarkers of human aging by analyzing imaging, biopsychosocial, cardiovascular, metabolomic, lipidomic, and microbiome variables. This study recruited 1030 participants aged ≥50 years (mean 67, range 50-96 years) that underwent structural and functional MRI to evaluate the brain, large blood vessels, heart, abdominal organs, fat, spine, musculoskeletal system and ultrasonography to assess carotid intima-media thickness and plaques. Patients were notified of incidental findings detected by a certified radiologist when necessary. Extensive data were also collected on anthropometrics, demographics, health history, neuropsychology, employment, income, family status, exposure to air pollution and cardiovascular status. In addition, several types of samples were gathered to allow for microbiome, metabolomic and lipidomic profiling. Using big data techniques to analyze all the data points from biological phenotyping together with health records and lifestyle measures, we aim to cultivate a deeper understanding about various biological factors (and combinations thereof) that underlie healthy and unhealthy aging."

RESEARCH QUESTION: Are early changes in RALE score over time associated with survival in patients with ARDS?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from patients enrolled in three centers in the Lung Imaging for Ventilation sEtting in ARDS (LIVE) trial with available chest radiographs at baseline (day 0) and days 2 or 3 were used. The RALE was scored by two independent reviewers. The primary end point was death by day 90, considering RALE score both at baseline and as a time-varying covariate in a marginal Cox survival model.
RESULTS: RALE was scored from 135, 64, and 88 radiographs on days 0, 2, and 3, respectively. Both baseline RALE (hazard ratio [HR] for each one-point increment, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P = .006) and the change in RALE over time (HR for each one-point decrease per unit of time, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99; P = .03) were associated with death by day 90, even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, vasopressor use, and total volume of fluids received since study entry.
INTERPRETATION: The change in RALE during the first days after ARDS onset is independently associated with survival and may be useful as a surrogate end point in future clinical trials of new therapeutics in ARDS."

CD3+, CD8+, and CD45RO+ T cells were quantified by immunohistochemical analyses. The patients were stratified into 5 IS groups: I0, I1, I2, I3, I4 for every 2 cell phenotypes (IS1 (CD8/CD45RO, IS2 (CD3/CD8), and IS3 (CD3/CD45RO), respectively. ImagePro Plus software was used in the calculation of the paraffin-embedded tumor sections.The staining of CD3+, CD8+, and CD45RO+ cells in the HBV-HCC tissue demonstrated that there were higher density and larger area of lymphocytes in the invasive margins (IM) region than in the center (CT). Univariate analysis showed that preoperative TNM staging (P = .01), serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level (P = .03), vascular invasion (P = .00), and density of CD3+T (CT) (P = 0.01) were correlated significantly with disease-free survival (DFS); serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (P = .02), tumor size (P = .00), serum cholinesterase (CHE) (P = .04), and GGT level (P = .01), density of CD3+T(CT) (P = .00), CD8+T(CT)(P = .00), CD45RO+T(CT) (P = .00), and CD45RO+T (IM) (P = .02) were correlated with overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis showed that TNM staging was not an independent prognostic factor of DFS and OS. Our results showed ISs did not have a significantly correlation with DFS (P = .35, .19, and .07, respectively), but it was correlated significantly with OS (P = .00, .00, and .00, respectively). There were statistical differences among the OS of every ISs subgroup except I0 and I1 by the Cox regressions analysis.The IS staging was closely related to the outcome of patients. It can compensate the TNM tumor classification system in predicting the prognosis of HBV-HCC patients."

METHODS: CBCT and 256-MDCT were compared based on three scan protocols: Standard-dose (≈24 mGy), reduced-dose (≈9 mGy), and low-dose (≈4 mGy). MDCT images were acquired in standard- and high-resolution mode (HR-MDCT) and reconstructed using filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR). Spatial resolution in linepairs (lp) and objective image noise (OIN) were assessed using dedicated phantoms. Image quality was assessed in scans of 25 cadaver heads using a Likert scale.
RESULTS: OIN was markedly higher in FBP-MDCT when compared to CBCT. IR lowered the OIN to comparable values in standard-mode MDCT only. CBCT provided a resolution of 13 lp/cm at standard-dose and 11 lp/cm at reduced-dose vs. 11 lp/cm and 10 lp/cm in HR-MDCT. Resolution of 10 lp/cm was observed for both devices using low-dose settings. Quality scores of MDCT and CBCT did not differ at standard-dose (CBCT, 3.4; MDCT, 3.3-3.5; p > 0.05). Using reduced- and low-dose protocols, CBCT was superior (reduced-dose, 3.2 vs. 2.8; low dose, 3.0 vs. 2.3; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Using the low-dose protocol, the assessed CBCT provided better objective and subjective image quality and equality in resolution. Similar image quality, but better resolution using CBCT was observed at higher exposure settings.
KEY POINTS: • The assessed CBCT device provided better image quality at lower doses. • Objective and subjective image quality were comparable using higher exposure settings. • CBCT showed superior spatial resolution in standard-dose and reduced-dose settings. • Modern noise-reducing tools are used in CBCT devices currently. • MDCT should be preferred for assessment of soft-tissue injuries and oncologic imaging."

Epub 2015 Jun 23.,Kuriyama N,Magn Reson Med Sci,2015,2015/06/25,,,10.2463/mrms.2014-0076,"PURPOSE: The brain produces intense heat as a result of cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow, and the generated heat is removed mainly through circulation of the intracranial blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because magnetic resonance (MR) images are constructed from analysis of the spin of various molecules, the diffusion coefficient can be used as a parameter that reflects the temperature of water molecules. We used diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-based MR imaging to measure the temperature of the CSF around the lateral ventricles in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).
METHODS: Our study included 33 cases of iNPH (Group N, mean age, 75.1 years) and 40 age-matched controls (Group C, mean age, 74.5 years). We calculated CSF temperature in the ventricular domain using the conversion formula to evaluate the feasibility of iNPH study.
RESULTS: The mean temperatures were significantly higher in Group N (37.6°C ± 0.4°C) than Group C (36.7°C ± 0.5°C; P < 0.01). The cut-off value of 37.2°C (more than the mean + 2 standard deviations [SD] of the values in Group C) showed sensitivity of 72.4% and specificity of 77.5% for distinguishing the 2 groups. We confirmed improved CSF temperature in the lateral ventricles in all patients examined both before and after shunting.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated ventricular temperatures in patients with iNPH (Group N) may represent a disturbance in heat balance. Our results showed that thermometry using DWI-based MR imaging can help in the noninvasive and consistent evaluation of CSF temperature and may thus provide a useful supplementary brain biomarker for iNPH."

The accuracy of the two methods, based on measuring registration error, and the time required for image fusion for both methods were recorded using in-house software and respectively compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: Image fusion was successful in all patients. The registration error was not significantly different between the two methods (auto-registration: median, 3.75 mm; range, 1.0-15.8 mm vs. manual registration: median, 2.95 mm; range, 1.2-12.5 mm, p = 0.242).

RESULTS: In total, 338 annotated histopathology images were included, 166 PMCTA transversal images and 285 OCT images were aligned in the comparison. The results from the comparison using the alignment procedure showed overall that the calcified plaques seem to be overestimated by PMCTA and underestimated by OCT.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3D fusion approach, aligning the images of PMCTA, OCT and histopathology as gold standard allowed for a slice-based comparison of the different modalities. The results showed that PMCTA overestimates the calcified plaques while OCT underestimates these, compared to histopathology."

Our aim was to determine its prevalence and potential implications in an unselected cohort. One-hundred- and eight consecutive patients diagnosed with HCM by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were included (median clinical follow up of 1718 days). All clinical and complementary test information was prospectively collected. The presence of a helical pattern was assessed by a simple measurement of the maximal left ventricle (LV) wall thickness (LVWT) for each of the 17 classical LV segments and it was classified in one of three types according to its extension. A helical distribution was detected in 58% of patients, and was associated to a higher incidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOT; 35% vs. 10%; p = 0.005) and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM; 30% vs. 13%, p = 0.053). No significant difference in the maximal LVWT was observed. However, the presence of a helical pattern showed a significant association with non sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT; 22% vs. 7%; p = 0.029) and was associated to a higher risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) calculated with the European society of cardiology (ESC) calculator (p = 0.006). Notably, patients with a more extense spiral had a higher incidence of heart failure (75% vs. 34%, p = 0.012) and all-cause death (21 vs. 3%, p = 0.049). A helical pattern is frequent in HCM and can be readily assessed on CMR standard cine sequences. In conclusion, a helical pattern carries negative clinical implications and is associated to a higher estimated risk of SCD."

ED component variables were tested for differences between and within sexes for two types of jaw closing. Seventeen female and 17 male subjects gave informed consent to participate. Diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders and images (magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography) were used to confirm healthy TMJ status. Numerical modelling predicted TMJ loads (F<sub>normal</sub> ) consequent to unilateral canine biting. Dynamic stereometry combined MR imaging and jaw-tracking data to measure ED component variables during 10 trials of each type of jaw closing in each subject's TMJs. These data were then used to calculate TMJ ED during jaw closing asymmetrically and symmetrically. Paired and Student's t tests assessed ED between jaw closing movements and sexes, respectively. Multivariate data analyses assessed ED component variable differences between jaw closing movements and sexes (α = 0.05). Contralateral TMJ ED were 3.6-fold and significantly larger (P &lt; .0001) during asymmetric versus symmetric jaw closing, due to significantly larger (P ≤ .001) distances of TMJ stress-field translation in asymmetric versus symmetric movement. During asymmetric jaw closing, contralateral TMJ ED were twofold and significantly larger (P = .036) in females versus males, due to 1.5-fold and significantly smaller (P ≤ .010) TMJ disc cartilage volumes under stress fields in females versus males. These results suggest that in healthy individuals, asymmetric compared to symmetric jaw closure in females compared to males has higher TMJ mechanical fatigue liabilities."

Epub 2019 Aug 2.,Lamarca A,Clin Cancer Res,2019,2019/08/04,,,10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0963,"PURPOSE: Tumor growth rate (TGR) represents the percentage change in tumor volume per month (%/m). Previous results from the GREPONET study showed that TGR measured after 3 months (TGR<sub>3m</sub>) of starting systemic treatment (ST) or watch and wait (WW) was an early biomarker predicting progression-free survival (PFS) in neuroendocrine tumors (NET).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients from 7 centers with advanced grade (G) 1/2 NETs from the pancreas (P)/small bowel (SB) initiating ST/WW were eligible. Computed tomography (CT)/MRI performed at prebaseline, baseline, and 3(±1) months of study entry were retrospectively reviewed. Aim-1: explore treatment-induced changes in TGR (ΔTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub>; paired T test), and Aim-2: validate TGR<sub>3m</sub> (&lt;0.8%/m vs. ≥0.8%/m) as an early biomarker in an independent cohort (Kaplan-Meier/Cox regression).
RESULTS: Of 785 patients screened, 127 were eligible. Mean (SD) TGR<sub>0</sub> and TGR<sub>3m</sub> were 5.4%/m (14.9) and -1.4%/m (11.8), respectively. Mean (SD) ΔTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> paired-difference was -6.8%/m (19.3; P &lt; 0.001). Most marked ΔTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> [mean (SD)] were identified with targeted therapies [-11.3%/m (4.7); P = 0.0237] and chemotherapy [-7.9%/m (3.4); P = 0.0261]. Multivariable analysis confirmed the absence of previous treatment (OR = 4.65; 95% CI, 1.31-16.52; P = 0.018) and low TGR<sub>3m</sub> (continuous variable; OR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19; P = 0.042) to be independent predictors of radiologic objective response. When the multivariable survival analysis for PFS (Cox regression) was adjusted to grade (P = 0.004) and stage (P = 0.017), TGR<sub>3m</sub> ≥ 0.8 (vs. &lt;0.8) maintained its significance as a prognostic factor (P &lt; 0.001), whereas TGR<sub>0</sub> and ΔTGR<sub>3m-BL</sub> did not. TGR<sub>3m</sub> ≥ 0.8%/m was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for PFS [external validation; Aim-2; multivariable HR 2.21 (95% CI, 1.21-3.70; P = 0.003)].
CONCLUSIONS: TGR has a role as a biomarker for monitoring response to therapy for early identification of treatment-induced changes and for early prediction of PFS and radiologic objective response."

BACKGROUND: In patients with small or nontransmural scars after MI, part of the VT substrate may be functional and, in addition, masked by high-voltage far-field signals arising from adjacent normal myocardium.
METHODS: In 60 consecutive patients, systematic analysis of electrograms recorded from the presumed infarct area was performed during sinus rhythm, RV pacing at 500 ms, and during a short-coupled RV extrastimulus. Sites showing low-voltage, near-field potentials with evoked conduction delay in response to RVE were targeted.
RESULTS: In 37 (62%) patients, ablation target sites located in areas with normal voltage during sinus rhythm were unmasked by RVE (hidden substrate group). These patients had better left ventricular function (36 ± 11% vs. 26 ± 12%; p = 0.003), smaller electroanatomical scars (&lt;1.5 mV), and smaller dense scars (&lt;0.5 mV) (median 59 and 14 cm2 vs. 82 and 44 cm2; p = 0.044 and p = 0.003) than did those in whom no hidden substrate was identified (overt substrate group). During a median follow-up of 16 months, 13 (22%) patients had VT recurrence. Patients with hidden substrate had a lower incidence of VT recurrence (12-month VT-free survival 89% vs. 50% in patients with overt substrate; p = 0.005). Compared with a historical cohort of 90 post-MI patients matched for left ventricular function and electroanatomical scar area, in whom no RVE was performed, patients in the hidden substrate group had a higher 1-year VT-free survival (89% vs. 73%; p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Hidden substrate ablation unmasked by RVE improves ablation outcome in post-MI patients with small or nontransmural scars."

Markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) measured in primary tumor cancer cells could be helpful to assess patient risk of metastatic disease, even among those otherwise diagnosed with local disease. Previous studies of EMT markers and patient outcomes used inconsistent methods and did not compare the clinical impact of different expression cut points for the same marker. Using digital image analysis, we measured the EMT markers Snail and E-cadherin in primary tumor specimens from 190 subjects in tissue microarrays from a population-based prospective cohort of colorectal cancer patients and estimated their associations with time-to-death. After measuring continuous marker expression data, we performed a systematic search for the cut point for each marker with the best model fit between dichotomous marker expression and time-to-death. We also assessed the potential clinical impact of different cut points for the same marker. After dichotomizing expression status at the statistically-optimal cut point, we found that Snail expression was not associated with time-to-death. When measured as a weighted average of tumor cores, low E-cadherin expression was associated with a greater risk of dying within 5 years of surgery than high expression (risk difference = 33 %, 95 % confidence interval 3-62 %). Identifying a clinically-optimal cut point for an EMT marker requires trade-offs between strength and precision of the association with patient outcomes, as well as consideration of the number of patients whose treatments might change based on using the marker at a given cut point."

Epub 2018 Feb 27.,Brangier A,Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord,2018,2018/02/28,,,10.1159/000485793,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for their role in haemostasis by interfering with the vitamin K cycle. Since vitamin K also participates in brain physiology, this voxel-based morphometric study aimed to determine whether the duration of exposure to VKAs correlated with focal brain volume reduction in older adults.
METHODS: In this exposed/unexposed (1: 2) study nested within the GAIT (Gait and Alzheimer Interactions Tracking) cohort, 18 participants exposed to VKA (mean age 75 ± 5 years; 33.3% female; mean exposure 2,122 ± 1,799 days) and 36 matched participants using no VKA (mean age 75 ± 5 years; 33.3% female) underwent MRI scanning of the brain. Cortical grey and white matter volumes were automatically segmented using statistical parametric mapping. Age, gender, educational level, history of atrial fibrillation, type of MRI, and total intracranial volume were included as covariables.
RESULTS: The duration of exposure to VKA correlated inversely across the whole brain with the subvolumes of two clusters in the grey matter (right frontal inferior operculum and right precuneus) and one cluster in the white matter (left middle frontal gyrus). In contrast, the grade of white matter hyperintensities did not differ according to the use of VKA.
CONCLUSION: We found focal atrophies in older adults exposed to VKA. These findings provide new insights elucidating the effects of VKAs on brain health and function in older adults."

While longitudinal MRI studies have been traditionally used to assess the issue of progression of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, information from cross-sectional neuroimaging studies directly comparing first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients to healthy controls may also be useful to further clarify this issue. With the recent interest in multisite mega-analyses combining structural MRI data from multiple centers aiming at increased statistical power, the present multisite voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study was carried out to examine patterns of brain structural changes according to the different stages of illness and to ascertain which (if any) of such structural abnormalities would be specifically correlated to potential clinical moderators, including cumulative exposure to antipsychotics, age of onset, illness duration and overall illness severity.
METHODS: We gathered a large sample of schizophrenia patients (161, being 99 chronic and 62 first-episode) and controls (151) from four previous morphometric MRI studies (1.5 T) carried out in the same geographical region of Brazil. Image processing and analyses were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software with the diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm. Group effects on regional gray matter (GM) volumes were investigated through whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons using General Linear Model Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA), always including total GM volume, scan protocol, age and gender as nuisance variables. Finally, correlation analyses were performed between the aforementioned clinical moderators and regional and global brain volumes.
RESULTS: First-episode schizophrenia subjects displayed subtle volumetric deficits relative to controls in a circumscribed brain regional network identified only in small volume-corrected (SVC) analyses (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected), including the insula, temporolimbic structures and striatum. Chronic schizophrenia patients, on the other hand, demonstrated an extensive pattern of regional GM volume decreases relative to controls, involving bilateral superior, inferior and orbital frontal cortices, right middle frontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, bilateral insulae and right superior and middle temporal cortices (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected over the whole brain). GM volumes in several of those brain regions were directly correlated with age of disease onset on SVC analyses for conjoined (first-episode and chronic) schizophrenia groups. There were also widespread foci of significant negative correlation between duration of illness and relative GM volumes, but such findings remained significant only for the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after accounting for the influence of age of disease onset. Finally, significant negative correlations were detected between life-time cumulative exposure to antipsychotics and total GM and white matter volumes in schizophrenia patients, but no significant relationship was found between indices of antipsychotic usage and relative GM volume in any specific brain region.
CONCLUSION: The above data indicate that brain changes associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more widespread in chronic schizophrenia compared to first-episode patients. Our findings also suggest that relative GM volume deficits may be greater in (presumably more severe) cases with earlier age of onset, as well as varying as a function of illness duration in specific frontal brain regions. Finally, our results highlight the potentially complex effects of the continued use of antipsychotic drugs on structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, as we found that cumulative doses of antipsychotics affected brain volumes globally rather than selectively on frontal-temporal regions."
32512407,Glioblastoma survival is better analyzed on preradiotherapy MRI than on postoperative MRI residual volumes: A retrospective observational study,"De Barros A, Attal J, Roques M, Nicolau J, Sol JC, Charni S, Cohen-Jonathan-Moyal E, Roux FE.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 2020 Sep;196:105972. doi: 10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105972. Epub 2020 May 29.,De Barros A,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,2020,2020/06/09,,,10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105972,"OBJECTIVES: Establishing an overall survival prognosis for resected glioblastoma during routine postoperative management remains a challenge. The aim of our single-center study was to assess the usefulness of basing survival analyses on preradiotherapy MRI (PRMR) rather than on postoperative MRI (POMR).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 75 patients with glioblastoma treated at our institute. We collected overall survival and MRI volumetric data. We analyzed two types of volumetric data: residual tumor volume and extent of resection. Overall survival rates were compared according to these two types of volumetric data, calculated on either POMR or PRMR and according to the presence or absence of residual enhancement.
RESULTS: Analysis of volumetric data revealed progression of some residual tumors between POMR and PRMR. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the correlations between extent of resection, residual tumor volume, and overall survival revealed significant differences between POMR and PRMR data. Both MRI scans indicated a difference between the complete resection subgroup and the incomplete resection subgroup, as median overall survival was longer in patients with complete resection. However, differences were significant for PRMR (25.3 vs. 15.5, p =  0.012), but not for POMR (21.3 vs. 15.8 months, p =  0.145). With a residual tumor volume cut-off value of 3 cm3, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed non-significant differences on POMR (p =  0.323) compared with PRMR (p =  0.007).
CONCLUSION: Survival in patients with resected glioblastoma was more accurately predicted by volumetric data acquired with PRMR. Differences in predicted survival between the POMR and PRMR groups can be attributed to changes in tumor behavior before adjuvant therapy."

This suggests that both types of dementia target specific structural networks. Here, we study SCNs in AD and bvFTD. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 31 AD patients, 24 bvFTD patients, and 30 controls from two centers specialized in dementia. Ten SCNs were defined based on structural covariance of gray matter density using independent component analysis. We studied group differences in SCNs using F-tests, with Bonferroni corrected t-tests, adjusted for age, gender, and study center. Associations with cognitive performance were studied using linear regression analyses. Cross-sectional group differences were found in three SCNs (all P < 0.0025). In bvFTD, we observed decreased anterior cingulate network integrity compared with AD and controls. Patients with AD showed decreased precuneal network integrity compared with bvFTD and controls, and decreased hippocampal network and anterior cingulate network integrity compared with controls. In AD, we found an association between precuneal network integrity and global cognitive performance (P = 0.0043). Our findings show that AD and bvFTD target different SCNs. The comparison of both types of dementia showed decreased precuneal (i.e., default mode) network integrity in AD and decreased anterior cingulate (i.e., salience) network integrity in bvFTD. This confirms the hypothesis that AD and bvFTD have distinct anatomical networks of degeneration and shows that structural covariance gives valuable insights in the understanding of network pathology in dementia."

The present study evaluated the use of the free internet-based image analysis program ImmunoRatio to score Ki-67 LI in breast cancer in comparison with manual counting.
METHODS: Ki-67 immunohistochemical detection was performed in 577 breast cancer cases, and the Ki-67 LI was determined by ImmunoRatio and manual counting.
RESULTS: The Ki-67 LI determined by ImmunoRatio correlated well with that obtained by manual counting. The concordance rate between ImmunoRatio and manual counting was excellent (κ coefficient of 0.881) at a Ki-67 LI cut-off value of 20%. Cases with high Ki-67 LI by ImmunoRatio were associated with poor overall survival, in particular in the hormone receptor positive group.
CONCLUSIONS: The web-based automated image analysis program ImmunoRatio is an attractive alternative to manual counting to determine the Ki-67 LI in breast cancer."

However, the precision of such a system has to be validated before it can be implemented for clinical use.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight people were photographed with the 3dMDface system using lighting from sets of 2 × 4 compact fluorescent lights in a clinical photography room without natural light sources. Two different operators then individually, and without interaction, marked 27 different anatomical landmarks using the 3dMD Patient software. During this process, the operators were fully blinded against each other. The purpose of the study was to determine the repeatability and accuracy of the system when used by different operators and at different times. The 3D differentiation was analyzed using mixed ANOVA with person as the random factor, and operator, repetition, and landmark as the fixed factors. The ANOVA was followed by a Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch F post-hoc test for landmarks.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis grouped the landmarks into three subgroups: high precision, medium precision and low precision.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtual 3D models derived from the 3dMDface system not only provide a high level of technical precision but also of intra- and interobserver reliability regarding landmark identification. However, some of the classical landmarks are not reliable when it comes to virtual models; these are generally landmarks that examiners of real patients would tend to identify using palpation of underlying bony structures, such as the soft gonion."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulated microcalcifications of different numbers (0 to >39), sizes (diameter, 100-800 μm), and shapes (round vs heterogeneous) were scattered by random distribution on 50 film phantoms each divided in 4 quadrants. The FFDM and DBT x-rays were taken from each of these 50 films with both x-ray mammography systems (SenoClaire; GE Healthcare, Selenia Dimensions, Hologic) using an anthropomorphic scattering body and automatic exposure control. The resulting exposure factors were similar to a clinical setting. The synthetically reconstructed 2D images were generated automatically on both systems. All FFDM, Synthetic-2D, and DBT images were interpreted in randomized order and independently of each other by 6 radiologists using a structured questionnaire.
RESULTS: The number categories of simulated microcalcifications were correctly evaluated in 55.3% of instances (quadrant by reader) in FFDM, 50.9% in the Synthetic-2D views, and 59.5% in DBT, summarized for 200 quadrants per reader for each Device A and B, respectively. Full-field digital mammography was superior to Synthetic-2D (mean difference, 4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-7%; P < 0.001), and DBT was superior to both FFDM (mean difference, 4%; 95% CI, 2%-7%; P = 0.002) and Synthetic-2D (mean difference, 9%; 95% CI, 6%-11%; P < 0.001). This trend was consistent in all subgroup analyses. The number of the smallest microcalcifications (100-399 μm) was correctly evaluated in 25.2% of the FFDM, in 14.2% for Synthetic-2D, and in 28.3% of the DBT images. Underestimations of the number of simulated microcalcifications were more common than overestimations. Regarding the size categories of simulated microcalcifications, the rates of correct assessments were in 45.4% of instances in FFDM, 39.9% in the Synthetic-2D views, and 43.6% in DBT, summarized for 200 quadrants per reader and both imaging devices.
CONCLUSIONS: In the presented in vitro environment using an anthropomorphic phantom model, standard full-field digital x-ray mammography was superior to synthetically reconstructed 2-dimensional images in the detection of simulated microcalcifications. In view of these results, it is questionable whether Synthetic-2D images can replace FFDM in clinical examinations at the present time. Further investigations are needed to assess the clinical impact of the in vitro results."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-four consecutive MS patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥50%) and who underwent successfully PMBV were studied. Successful immediate result was defined as post-procedural mitral valve area ≥1.5 cm2 and ≤2/4 mitral regurgitation by catheterization. During a follow-up of 4.2 ± 3.0 years, there were 7 deaths (11%) and 21 late mitral valve reintervention (33%). Univariate predictors of death were global longitudinal strain (GLS), age, LVEF, and pre- and post-procedural pulmonary artery pressures. In the multivariate Cox model, GLS was the strongest predictor of death [hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI), 1.45 (1.07-2.04); P= 0.01]. For the composite endpoint, GLS and post-procedural left atrial pressure (LAP) were univariate predictors of death or reintervention. At multivariable analysis, GLS and post-procedural LAP remained in the final model with strong trend towards significance [GLS HR (95% CI), 1.17 (0.99-1.37); P= 0.056]. There was no correlation between diastolic dysfunction identified at catheterization and standard echocardiographic and 2D-STE indexes, even after adjustments for age, left ventricular mass, effective arterial elastance (afterload), and end-diastolic volume indexes (preload).
CONCLUSION: GLS is a powerful predictor of long-term outcome after successful PMBV and provides incremental prognostic value over traditional parameters. Echocardiographic diagnosis of concomitant diastolic dysfunction in MS patients remains elusive."

Microbiological culture, obtained after open biopsy or graft explantation, and clinical follow-up of the patients served as the standard of reference.
RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy of PET/CT for the diagnosis of VGI was 100%, 50%, 100%, 72.2%, and 78.3%, using the most favorable SUV<sub>max</sub> cut-off ≥ 4.9. Respective values for CE-CT were 100%, 50%, 100%, 72.2%, and 78.3% for reader 1, and 92.3%, 80%, 88.9%, 85.7%, and 86.9% for reader 2; while respective values for combined CE-PET/CT were 100%, 70%, 100%, 81.3%, and 86.9% for reader 1, and 100%, 80%, 100%, 86.7%, and 91.3% for reader 2. Additionally, imaging provided a conclusive clinical diagnosis in patients without graft infection (i.e., other sites of infection): five of ten patients with CE-CT, six of ten patients with PET/CT, and seven of ten patients with combined CE-PET/CT.
CONCLUSION: The diagnostic accuracy of combined CE-PET/CT in patients with suspected VGI is very high. The combination of the high sensitivity of PET/CT in detecting metabolically active foci in infection, and the high specificity of CE-CT in detecting anatomic alterations, appears to be the reason why combined imaging outperforms stand-alone imaging in diagnosing VGI and may be supportive in future decision-making of difficult cases of suspected VGI.

Epub 2024 Mar 6.,Miller RJH,JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,2024,2024/03/08,PMC11222053,NIHMS1979229,10.1016/j.jcmg.2024.01.006,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography attenuation correction (CTAC) improves perfusion quantification of hybrid myocardial perfusion imaging by correcting for attenuation artifacts. Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) from CTAC to improve risk prediction but could potentially derive additional anatomic features.
OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluated AI-based derivation of cardiac anatomy from CTAC and assessed its added prognostic utility.
METHODS: The authors considered consecutive patients without known coronary artery disease who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (CT) myocardial perfusion imaging at 3 separate centers. Previously validated AI models were used to segment CAC and cardiac structures (left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, right ventricular volume, and left ventricular [LV] mass) from CTAC. They evaluated associations with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which included death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or revascularization.
RESULTS: In total, 7,613 patients were included with a median age of 64 years. During a median follow-up of 2.4 years (IQR: 1.3-3.4 years), MACEs occurred in 1,045 (13.7%) patients. Fully automated AI processing took an average of 6.2 ± 0.2 seconds for CAC and 15.8 ± 3.2 seconds for cardiac volumes and LV mass. Patients in the highest quartile of LV mass and left atrium, LV, right atrium, and right ventricular volume were at significantly increased risk of MACEs compared to patients in the lowest quartile, with HR ranging from 1.46 to 3.31. The addition of all CT-based volumes and CT-based LV mass improved the continuous net reclassification index by 23.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: AI can automatically derive LV mass and cardiac chamber volumes from CT attenuation imaging, significantly improving cardiovascular risk assessment for hybrid perfusion imaging."

Epub 2018 Aug 1.,Larue RTHM,Acta Oncol,2018,2018/08/02,,,10.1080/0284186X.2018.1486039,"BACKGROUND: Radiomic features retrieved from standard CT-images have shown prognostic power in several tumor sites. In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment CT radiomic features to predict overall survival of esophageal cancer patients after chemoradiotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two datasets of independent centers were analyzed, consisting of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy (Carboplatin/Paclitaxel) and 41.4Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery if feasible. In total, 1049 radiomic features were calculated from the primary tumor volume. Recursive feature elimination was performed to select the 40 most relevant predictors. Using these 40 features and six clinical variables as input, two random forest (RF) models predicting 3-year overall survival were developed.
RESULTS: In total 165 patients from center 1 and 74 patients from center 2 were used. The radiomics-based RF model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95%CI 0.61-0.77), with the top-5 most important features for 3-year survival describing tumor heterogeneity after wavelet filtering. In the validation dataset, the RF model yielded an AUC of 0.61 (95%CI 0.47-0.75). Kaplan Meier plots were significantly different between risk groups in the training dataset (p = .027) and borderline significant in the validation dataset (p = .053). The clinical RF model yielded AUCs of 0.63 (95%CI 0.54-0.71) and 0.62 (95%CI 0.49-0.76) in the training and validation dataset, respectively. Risk groups did not reach a significant correlation with pathological response in the primary tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: A RF model predicting 3-year overall survival based on pretreatment CT radiomic features was developed and validated in two independent datasets of esophageal cancer patients. The radiomics model had better prognostic power compared to the model using standard clinical variables."

METHODS: Six- and 12-month changes in regional MRI volumes and PSP Rating Scale scores were examined in 55 patients with PSP and 33 patients with CBS (78% amyloid PET negative) compared to 30 normal controls from a multicenter natural history study. Longitudinal voxel-based morphometric analyses identified patterns of volume loss, and region-of-interest analyses examined rates of volume loss in brainstem (midbrain, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle), cortical, and subcortical regions based on previously validated atlases. Results were compared to those in a replication cohort of 226 patients with PSP with MRI data from the AL-108-231 clinical trial.
RESULTS: Patients with CBS exhibited greater baseline atrophy and greater longitudinal atrophy rates in cortical and basal ganglia regions than patients with PSP; however, midbrain and pontine atrophy rates were similar. Voxel-wise analyses showed distinct patterns of regional longitudinal atrophy in each group as compared to normal controls. The midbrain/pons volumetric ratio differed between diagnoses but remained stable over time. In both patient groups, brainstem atrophy rates were correlated with disease progression measured using the PSP Rating Scale.
CONCLUSIONS: Volume loss is quantifiable over a period of 6 months in CBS and PSP. Future clinical trials may be able to combine CBS and PSP to measure therapeutic effects."

METHODS: A total of 275 patients with LACC receiving NACT were enrolled in this study from eight hospitals, and allocated to training and testing sets (2:1 ratio). Three radiomic feature sets were extracted from the intratumoural region of T1-weighted images, intratumoural region of T2-weighted images, and peritumoural region of T2-weighted images before NACT for each patient. With a feature selection strategy, three single sequence radiomic models were constructed, and three additional combined models were constructed by combining the features of different regions or sequences. The performance of all models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve.
FINDINGS: The combined model of the intratumoural zone of T1-weighted images, intratumoural zone of T2-weighted images,and peritumoural zone of T2-weighted images achieved an AUC of 0.998 in training set and 0.999 in testing set, which was significantly better (p < .05) than the other radiomic models. Moreover, no significant variation in performance was found if different training sets were used.
INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrated that MRI-based radiomic features hold potential in the pretreatment prediction of response to NACT in LACC, which could be used to identify rightful patients for receiving NACT avoiding unnecessary treatment."

Epub 2019 Sep 4.,Shen C,Clin Respir J,2019,2019/07/26,,,10.1111/crj.13064,"OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of the clot volume and right ventricular dysfunction for risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) patients.
METHODS: CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) images of 158 APE patients were collected. After excluding 38 (24.1%) patients due to unsatisfactory quality, 120 APE patients (61 males and 59 females) were divided into high-risk (n = 37) and non-high-risk (n = 83) groups. Clot burden was measured by an automated programme (clot volume) and by two semi-quantitative systems (Qanadli and Mastora scores). The ratios of the right ventricular diameter to left ventricular diameter (RVd/LVd) and area (RVa/LVa) were obtained. The correlations amongst the above parameters were analysed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to determine the efficacy of high-risk APE. Multivariate analyses were used to identify the independent predictors.
RESULTS: Strong positive correlations were found between the clot volume and both Qanadli score (r2  = 0.696, P &lt; 0.001) and Mastora score (r2  = 0.728, P &lt; 0.001), and moderate correlations were found between the clot volume and both RVd/LVd (r2  = 0.392, P &lt; 0.001) and RVa/LVa (r2  = 0.389, P &lt; 0.001). The clot volume contributed the highest efficacy (AUC = 0.992) for the identification of high-risk cases, followed by Mastora score (0.968), Qanadli score (0.952), RVa/LVa (0.900) and RVd/LVd (0.892). The clot volume and RVd/LVd were two independent factors of high-risk APE.
CONCLUSIONS: The clot volume is correlated with semi-quantitative clot burden scores and CT measured cardiac parameters. The clot volume and RVd/LVd were two independent factors of high-risk APE patients."

We investigate if computationally quantified tubular features can enhance prognostication and reveal spatial relationships with interstitial fibrosis.
METHODS: Deep-learning and image-processing-based segmentations were employed in N=254/266 PAS-WSIs from the NEPTUNE/CureGN datasets (135/153 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and 119/113 minimal change disease) for: cortex, tubular lumen (TL), epithelium (TE), nuclei (TN), and basement membrane (TBM). N=104 pathomic features were extracted from these segmented tubular substructures and summarized at the patient level using summary statistics. The tubular features were quantified across the biopsy and in manually segmented regions of mature interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), pre-IFTA and non-IFTA in the NEPTUNE dataset. Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance was used in the NEPTUNE dataset to select features most associated with disease progression and proteinuria remission. Ridge-penalized Cox models evaluated their predictive discrimination compared to clinical/demographic data and visual-assessment. Models were evaluated in the CureGN dataset.
RESULTS: N=9 features were predictive of disease progression and/or proteinuria remission. Models with tubular features had high prognostic accuracy in both NEPTUNE and CureGN datasets and increased prognostic accuracy for both outcomes (5.6%-7.7% and 1.6%-4.6% increase for disease progression and proteinuria remission, respectively) compared to conventional parameters alone in the NEPTUNE dataset. TBM thickness/area and TE simplification progressively increased from non- to pre- and mature IFTA.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously under-recognized, quantifiable, and clinically relevant tubular features in the kidney parenchyma can enhance understanding of mechanisms of disease progression and risk stratification."

METHODS: A web application was made accessible on the website of the regional Administration. Fifty-nine colposcopists out of the registered 65 logged in, viewed a posted set of 50 digital colpophotographs, classified them for colposcopic impression and need for biopsy, and indicated the most appropriate site for biopsy with a left-button mouse click on the image.
RESULTS: Total biopsy failure rate, comprising both nonbiopsy and incorrect selection of biopsy site, was 0.20 in CIN1, 0.11 in CIN2, 0.09 in CIN3, and 0.02 in carcinoma. Errors in the selection of biopsy site were stable between 0.08 and 0.09 in the three grades of CIN while decreasing to 0.01 in carcinoma. In multivariate analysis, the risk of incorrect selection of biopsy site was 1.97 for CIN2, 2.52 for CIN3, and 0.29 for carcinoma versus CIN1.
CONCLUSIONS: Although total biopsy failure rate decreased regularly with increasing severity of histological diagnosis, the rate of incorrect selection of biopsy site was stable up to CIN3. In multivariate analysis, CIN2 and CIN3 had an independently increased risk of incorrect selection of biopsy site."

Epub 2017 Oct 5.,Cho SM,World Neurosurg,2018,2017/10/10,,,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.09.168,"OBJECTIVE: The most common birth-associated head injuries during vaginal delivery are cephalhematomas and subgaleal hematomas. Cranial injuries are rarely encountered. The neonate cranium is soft and pliable, and greenstick skull fractures (GSFs) are expected to be more frequent than linear or depressed fractures, but they are extremely difficult to detect with simple skull radiography. As a result, no reports have been issued on this topic to date. Recent reports suggest that technological advances in 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) have successfully enhanced the diagnostic accuracy for cranial fractures. The authors researched the types and characteristics of GSFs and the diagnostic accuracy of 3D CT for cranial fractures in neonates.
METHODS: The simple skull radiographs and 3D CT images of 101 neonates were retrospectively evaluated and compared with respect to diagnosis of cranial fractures, and skull GSFs were classified on the basis of 3D CT findings into 5 types depending on multiplicity and location.
RESULTS: 3D CT detected 88 cases of cranial fractures, that is, 89 GSFs, 4 combined GSFs and linear fractures, and 3 combined GSFs and depressed fractures. The diagnostic rate of 3DCT was 91% and this was significantly higher than the 13% rate of simple skull radiographs (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: GSFs rather than linear fractures were found to account for most cranial injuries among neonates. The diagnostic accuracy of 3D CT was considerably superior than simple skull radiography, but the high radiation exposure levels of 3D CT warrant the need for development of a modality with lower radiation exposure."

Epub 2019 Jan 16.,Pang H,J Magn Reson Imaging,2019,2019/01/18,,,10.1002/jmri.26562,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for an imaging-based tool for measuring vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and overall survival (OS) in patients with glioma.
PURPOSE: To assess the correlation between cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured by 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling (3D-ASL), and VEGF expression in gliomas on the basis of coregistered localized biopsy, and investigate whether CBF correlated with survival month (SM) in glioma patients.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective cohort.
SUBJECTS: Thirty-seven patients with gliomas from whom 63 biopsy specimens were obtained.
SEQUENCE: 3D-ASL acquired with a 3.0T MR unit.
ASSESSMENT: Biopsy specimens were grouped as high-grade (HGG) or low-grade glioma (LGG). CBF measurements were spatially matched with VEGF expression by coregistered localized biopsies, and the CBF value was correlated with quantitative VEGF expression for each specimen. Patients' survival information was derived and connected with CBF.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Patients' OS was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression methods. VEGF expression and CBF were compared in both LGG and HGG. The Spearman rank correlation was calculated for CBF and VEGF expression, SM. Significance level, P < 0.05.
RESULTS: CBF-derived 3D-ASL positively correlated significantly with VEGF expression in both LGG (31 specimens) and HGG (32 specimens), r = 0.604 (P < 0.001) and r = 0.665 (P < 0.001), respectively. LGG and HGG together gave a correlation coefficient r = 0.728 (P < 0.001). Median survival for LGG and HGG patients was 34.19 and 17.17 months, respectively (P = 0.037); CBF value negatively correlated significantly with SM with r = -0.714 (P < 0.001) regardless of glioma grade. CBF was an independent risk factor for OS with HR = 1.027 (P = 0.044), 1.028 (P = 0.010) for univariate/multivariate regression analysis.
DATA CONCLUSION: CBF determined by 3D-ASL correlates with VEGF expression in glioma and is an independent risk factor for OS in these patients.

However, their role in specific psychiatric diseases remains poorly understood. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, which affect the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes, are critical for our understanding of molecular mechanisms in schizophrenia. Using clinical, imaging, genetic, and epigenetic data of 103 patients with schizophrenia and 111 healthy controls of the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) study of schizophrenia, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis to identify markers for schizophrenia-associated intermediate phenotypes. Genes were ranked based on the correlation between DNA methylation patterns and each phenotype, and then searched for enrichment in 221 predicted microRNA target gene sets. We found the predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene set to be significantly enriched for genes (EPHA4, PKNOX1, ESR1, among others) whose methylation status is correlated with hippocampal volume independent of disease status. Our results were strengthened by significant associations between hsa-miR-219a-5p target gene methylation patterns and hippocampus-related neuropsychological variables. IPA pathway analysis of the respective predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes revealed associated network functions in behavior and developmental disorders. Altered methylation patterns of predicted hsa-miR-219a-5p target genes are associated with a structural aberration of the brain that has been proposed as a possible biomarker for schizophrenia. The (dys)regulation of microRNA target genes by epigenetic mechanisms may confer additional risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Further study is needed to understand possible interactions between microRNAs and epigenetic changes and their impact on risk for brain-based disorders such as schizophrenia."

Six-micrometer-thick hippocampal slices were stained for amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and cresyl violet. Hippocampal subfields were manually traced. Neuronal counts, Aβ, and tau burden for each hippocampal subfield were obtained.
RESULTS: We found significant correlations between hippocampal volume and Braak and Braak staging (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau (ρ = -0.53, P = .034), Aβ burden (ρ = -0.61, P = .012), and neuronal count (ρ = 0.77, P < .001).

We tested whether automated digital (TIL) analysis (ADTA) improved accuracy of prediction of disease specific survival (DSS) based on current pathology standards. ADTA was applied to a training cohort (n = 80) and a cutoff value was defined based on a Receiver Operating Curve. ADTA was then applied to a validation cohort (n = 145) and the previously determined cutoff value was used to stratify high and low risk patients, as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p ≤ 0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed using ADTA, depth, and ulceration as co-variables and showed that ADTA contributed to DSS prediction (HR: 4.18, CI 1.51-11.58, p = 0.006).

METHODS: We included 88 patients (mean age = 59 years ± 13.5, 69% male) who underwent a TNC coronary calcium scan followed by CCTA on PCCT. VNC images were reconstructed in 87 patients and VNI in 88 patients by virtually removing iodine from the CCTA images. For all reconstructions, CAC scores were determined, and patients were classified into risk categories. The overall agreement of the reconstructions was analyzed by Bland-Altman plots and the level of matching classifications.
RESULTS: The median CAC score on TNC was 27.8 [0-360.4] compared to 8.5 [0.2-101.6] (p &lt; 0.001) on VNC and 72.2 [1.3-398.8] (p &lt; 0.001) on VNI. Bland-Altman plots depicted a bias of 148.8 (ICC = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001) and - 57.7 (ICC = 0.95, p &lt; 0.001) for VNC and VNI, respectively. Of all patients with CAC<sub>TNC</sub> = 0, VNC reconstructions scored 63% of the patients correctly, while VNI scored 54% correctly. Of the patients with CAC<sub>TNC</sub> &gt; 0, VNC and VNI reconstructions detected the presence of coronary calcium in 90% and 92% of the patients. CAC<sub>VNC</sub> tended to underestimate CAC score, whereas CAC<sub>VNI</sub> overestimated, especially in the lower risk categories. According to the risk categories, VNC misclassified 55% of the patients, while VNI misclassified only 32%.
CONCLUSION: Compared to TNC images, VNC underestimated and VNI overestimated the actual CAC scores. VNI reconstructions quantify and classify coronary calcification scores more accurately than VNC reconstructions.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Photon-counting CT enables spectral imaging, which might obviate the need for non-contrast enhanced coronary calcium scoring, but optimization is necessary for the clinical implementation of the algorithms.
KEY POINTS: • Photon-counting computed tomography uses spectral information to virtually remove the signal of contrast agents from contrast-enhanced scans. • Virtual non-contrast reconstructions tend to underestimate coronary artery calcium scores compared to true non-contrast images, while virtual non-iodine reconstructions tend to overestimate the calcium scores. • Virtual non-iodine reconstructions might obviate the need for non-contrast enhanced calcium scoring, but optimization is necessary for the clinical implementation of the algorithms."

Epub 2021 Nov 24.,Shaban M,J Pathol,2022,2021/10/26,,,10.1002/path.5819,"The infiltration of T-lymphocytes in the stroma and tumour is an indication of an effective immune response against the tumour, resulting in better survival. In this study, our aim was to explore the prognostic significance of tumour-associated stroma infiltrating lymphocytes (TASILs) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through an AI-based automated method. A deep learning-based automated method was employed to segment tumour, tumour-associated stroma, and lymphocytes in digitally scanned whole slide images of HNSCC tissue slides. The spatial patterns of lymphocytes and tumour-associated stroma were digitally quantified to compute the tumour-associated stroma infiltrating lymphocytes score (TASIL-score). Finally, the prognostic significance of the TASIL-score for disease-specific and disease-free survival was investigated using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Three different cohorts of haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained tissue slides of HNSCC cases (n = 537 in total) were studied, including publicly available TCGA head and neck cancer cases. The TASIL-score carries prognostic significance (p = 0.002) for disease-specific survival of HNSCC patients. The TASIL-score also shows a better separation between low- and high-risk patients compared with the manual tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) scoring by pathologists for both disease-specific and disease-free survival. A positive correlation of TASIL-score with molecular estimates of CD8+ T cells was also found, which is in line with existing findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to automate the quantification of TASILs from routine H&amp;E slides of head and neck cancer. Our TASIL-score-based findings are aligned with the clinical knowledge, with the added advantages of objectivity, reproducibility, and strong prognostic value. Although we validated our method on three different cohorts (n = 537 cases in total), a comprehensive evaluation on large multicentric cohorts is required before the proposed digital score can be adopted in clinical practice. © 2021 The Authors.

PURPOSE: To identify the machine learning classifiers that predict best osteoporotic bone fractures and, from the data, to highlight the imaging features and the anatomical regions that contribute most to prediction performance.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective (cross-sectional) case-control study.
POPULATION: Thirty-two women with prior fragility bone fractures, of mean age = 61.6 and body mass index (BMI) = 22.7 kg/m2 , and 60 women without fractures, of mean age = 62.3 and BMI = 21.4 kg/m2 . Field Strength/ Sequence: 3D FLASH at 3T.
ASSESSMENT: Quantitative MRI outcomes by software algorithms. Mechanical and topological microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone were calculated for five femoral regions, and added to the vector of features together with bone mineral density measurement, fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) score, and personal characteristics such as age, weight, and height. We fitted 15 classifiers using 200 randomized cross-validation datasets. Statistical Tests: Data: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Model Performance: sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-test, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Two-sided t-test, with P < 0.05 for statistical significance.
RESULTS: The top three performing classifiers are RUS-boosted trees (in particular, performing best with head data, F1 = 0.64 ± 0.03), the logistic regression and the linear discriminant (both best with trochanteric datasets, F1 = 0.65 ± 0.03 and F1 = 0.67 ± 0.03, respectively). A permutation of these classifiers comprised the best three performers for four out of five anatomical datasets. After averaging across all the anatomical datasets, the score for the best performer, the boosted trees, was F1 = 0.63 ± 0.03 for All-features dataset, F1 = 0.52 ± 0.05 for the no-MRI dataset, and F1 = 0.48 ± 0.06 for the no-FRAX dataset. Data Conclusion: Of many classifiers, the RUS-boosted trees, the logistic regression, and the linear discriminant are best for predicting osteoporotic fracture. Both MRI and FRAX independently add value in identifying osteoporotic fractures. The femoral head, greater trochanter, and inter-trochanter anatomical regions within the proximal femur yielded better F1-scores for the best three classifiers.

This study investigates the relationship between mandibular width and the risk of developing OSA.We retrospectively analyzed 3D reconstructions of head and neck computed tomography (CT) scans at our institution for mandibular width, neck circumference, neck fat volume (NFV), airway volume (AWV), and NFV:AWV ratio. Age, gender, and BMI were also documented. Patients were contacted to complete a STOP-BANG survey to assess OSA risk. Only patients with reconstructable scans and completed STOP-BANG questionnaires were included in the study. Survey results were analyzed to assess the correlation between mandible width and STOP-BANG. Mandible association was also compared to the associations of the other known risk factors.The final analysis included 427 patients with a mean age of 58.98 years (standard deviation = 16.77), 56% of whom were male. Mandibular width was found to positively correlate with STOP-BANG score (r = .416, P < .001). Statistically significant differences between mandible size for each risk group was seen (P < .001). After controlling for age and sex, mandible size was significantly different only for the low risk vs. high risk groups (odds ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.20; P = .007). Furthermore, when stratified according to mandible size, the small mandible group (<77.50 mm) predominantly consisted of low risk patients; the medium size mandible group (77.50-84.40 mm) was predominated by intermediate risk patients, and large mandible (>84.40 mm) was predominantly seen in high risk patients. Mandible width expressed a stronger association than NFV:AWV ratio, but neck circumference and NFV had stronger associations than did mandible width.In addition to previously documented OSA risk factors, mandibular width is positively correlated with OSA as an independent risk factor. Observation of a wide mandible (jaw) should raise awareness of OSA risk and increase screening methods when appropriate."

METHODS: This prospective observational study included deceased patients from the intensive care unit and internal medicine wards between October 2013 and August 2017. The primary outcome was percentage agreement on COD between the reference standard (autopsy) and the alternative postmortem examinations (clinical assessment vs PMCT or PMCT+PMS). In addition, the COD of patient groups with and without conventional autopsy were compared with respect to involved organ systems and pathologies.
RESULTS: Of 730 eligible cases, 144 could be included for analysis: 63 underwent PCMT without autopsy and 81 underwent both PMCT and autopsy. Agreement with autopsy-determined COD was significantly higher for both PMCT with PMS (42/57, 74%), and PMCT alone (53/81, 65%) than for clinical assessment (40/81, 51%; p=0.007 and p=0.03, respectively). The difference in agreement between PMCT with PMS and PMCT alone was not significant (p=0.13). The group with autopsy had a significantly higher prevalence of circulatory system involvement and perfusion disorders, and a lower prevalence of pulmonary system involvement.
CONCLUSION: PMCT and PMS confer additional diagnostic value in establishing the COD. Shortcomings in detecting vascular occlusions and perfusion disorders and susceptibility to pulmonary postmortem changes could in future be improved by additional techniques. Both PMCT and PMS are feasible in clinical practice and an alternative when autopsy cannot be performed."

Epub 2017 Aug 25.,Chen SN,Aesthetic Plast Surg,2017,2017/08/27,,,10.1007/s00266-017-0961-5,"BACKGROUND: Double eyelidplasty can enhance the eye size and facial attractiveness of Asian individuals with single eyelids. The authors hypothesize that a supratarsal fold can induce an eye size assimilation illusion to enhance eye dimensions and aesthetics, and seek to define the optimum vertical proportion between a supratarsal fold and the eye fissure associated with maximal induction of the size assimilation illusion.
METHODS: A photometric study of the replicated photographs of ten female Taiwanese patients after double eyelidplasty was designed. Each photograph was edited by shifting the supratarsal folds vertically at a regular fold/eye ratio increment of 0.1. The perceived attractiveness of edited photographs of each patient was rated by 100 adult observers using a score of 1-5. The palpebral parameters were measured and analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean rating score increased gradually when a supratarsal fold was added and peaked when the fold/eye ratio was 0.3 and the mean Chen's double eyelid fold ratio was 0.631 ± 0.023. After the peak, the mean score decreased gradually and was lower than the photograph without a fold when the fold/eye ratio exceeded 0.5 and the mean Chen's ratio exceeded 0.729 ± 0.027.
CONCLUSION: Within the optimal ranges of the fold/eye ratio and Chen's double eyelid fold ratio, eyes are perceived as larger and more attractive due to a hybrid presentation of two interdependent eye size assimilation illusions induced by a supratarsal fold in the brow-eye unit. ""Chen's double eyelid fold illusion"" is proposed to describe this complex visual phenomenon.

Epub 2017 Jan 12.,Kim WH,Breast Cancer Res Treat,2017,2017/01/14,,,10.1007/s10549-017-4105-z,"PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performances of tomosynthesis and ultrasonography as adjunctives to digital mammography in women with dense breasts.
METHODS: A total of 778 women with dense breasts underwent digital mammography with tomosynthesis and ultrasonography for screening and diagnostic purposes. The findings of tomosynthesis and ultrasonography were evaluated independently. The primary endpoint was overall diagnostic accuracy determined by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Secondary endpoints included sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
RESULTS: Of the 778 participants, 698 women (140 breast cancers) were included in the analysis. Based on the AUC findings, the non-inferiority of tomosynthesis to ultrasonography was established in the overall group as well as in all subgroups except for that comprising women with extremely dense breast composition. There were no significant differences in AUC between tomosynthesis and ultrasonography among asymptomatic participants and participants who underwent imaging for screening (0.912 vs. 0.934 [P = 0.403] and 0.987 vs. 0.950 [P = 0.270], respectively). Tomosynthesis exhibited lower sensitivity (91.4 vs. 96.4%; P = 0.039), and higher specificity (83.9 vs. 70.4%; P < 0.001) and positive predictive value (58.7 vs. 45.0%; P < 0.001) than ultrasonography.
CONCLUSIONS: Tomosynthesis exhibits comparable performance to ultrasonography as an adjunct to mammography for diagnosis of breast cancer, except among women with extremely dense breasts."

Epub 2016 Jul 12.,Samouda H,Pediatr Diabetes,2017,2016/07/13,,,10.1111/pedi.12415,"BACKGROUND: The efficiency of traditional anthropometric measurements such as body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (Waist C) used to replace biomedical imaging for assessing visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is still highly controversial in youth.
HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the most accurate model predicting VAT in overweight/obese youth, using various anthropometric measurements and their correlation with different body fat compartments, especially by testing, for the first time in youth, the hypothesis that subtracting the anthropometric measurement the most highly correlated with subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) and less correlated possible with VAT from an anthropometric abdominal measurement highly correlated with visceral and total abdominal adipose tissue (TAAT), predicts VAT with higher accuracy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: VAT and SAAT data resulted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis performed on 181 boys and girls (7-17 y) from Diabetes & Endocrinology Care Paediatrics Clinic in Luxembourg. Height, weight, abdominal diameters, waist, hip, and thigh circumferences were measured with a view to developing the anthropometric VAT predictive algorithms.
RESULTS: In girls, subtracting proximal thigh circumference (Proximal Thigh C), the most closely correlated anthropometric measurement with SAAT, from Waist C, the most closely correlated anthropometric measurement with VAT was instrumental in improving VAT prediction, in comparison with the most accurate single VAT anthropometric surrogate. [Formula: see text] Residual analysis showed a negligible estimation error (5 cm2 ). In boys, Waist C was the best VAT predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: Subtraction of abdominal subcutaneous fat is important to predict VAT in overweight/obese girls."

We aimed to investigate the relationship between septal deformation patterns studied by longitudinal speckle tracking and clinical outcome following CRT.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 284 CRT candidates from two centres (HF NYHA classes II-IV, ejection fraction < 35%, QRS ≥ 120 ms) were prospectively included. Longitudinal strain of the septum in the apical four-chamber view determined three patterns of septal contraction. The endpoints were overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization for HF. Compared with patterns 1 or 2, pattern 3 was associated with an increased risk for both overall and cardiovascular mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.85-7.75, P < 0.001 and HR = 3.84, 95% CI: 1.45-10.16, P = 0.007, respectively] and HF hospitalization (HR = 4.41, 95% CI: 2.18-8.90, P < 0.001). Addition of septal patterns to multivariable models, including baseline QRS width and presence of left bundle branch block, improved risk prediction, and discrimination. In patients with intermediate QRS duration (120-150 ms), pattern 3 remained associated with a worse outcome than pattern 1 or 2 (P < 0.05 for all endpoints).
CONCLUSION: The identification of septal deformation patterns provides important prognostic information in CRT candidates in addition to ordinary clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic predictors of outcome in HF patients. This parameter may be particularly useful in patients with intermediate QRS duration in whom the benefit of CRT remains uncertain."

We developed a deep learning-based biomarker which noninvasively estimates a tumor immune profile with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods: A deep learning model to predict cytolytic activity score (CytAct) using semi-automatically segmented tumors on FDG-PET trained by a publicly available dataset paired with tissue RNA sequencing (n = 93). This model was validated in two independent cohorts of LUAD: SNUH (n = 43) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 16). The model was applied to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohort, which consists of patients with metastatic LUAD who underwent ICB treatment (n = 29). Results: The predicted CytAct showed a positive correlation with CytAct of RNA sequencing in validation cohorts (Spearman rho = 0.32, p = 0.04 in SNUH cohort; spearman rho = 0.47, p = 0.07 in TCGA cohort). In ICB cohort, the higher predicted CytAct of individual lesion was associated with more decrement in tumor size after ICB treatment (Spearman rho = -0.54, p &lt; 0.001). Higher minimum predicted CytAct in each patient associated with significantly prolonged progression free survival and overall survival (Hazard ratio 0.25, p = 0.001 and 0.18, p = 0.004, respectively). In patients with multiple lesions, ICB responders had significantly lower variance of predicted CytActs (p = 0.005). Conclusion: The deep learning model that predicts CytAct using FDG-PET of LUAD was validated in independent cohorts. Our approach may be used to noninvasively assess an immune profile and predict outcomes of LUAD patients treated with ICB."

METHODS: We derived data from the Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. A total of 1,089 patients from 45 of 114 participating sites of the trial undergoing baseline MRI/angiography were included in this subgroup analysis. Patterns of infarction and ICAS were recorded for each individual. The primary efficacy outcome was an ischemic stroke at the 90-day follow-up. We assessed the associations between imaging patterns and prognosis of patients using multivariable Cox regression models.
RESULTS: Among the 1,089 patients included in this subgroup analysis, 93 (8.5%) patients had a recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days. Compared with those without infarction or ICAS, patients with single infarction with ICAS (11.9% vs 1.3%, hazard ratio [HR] 6.25, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.40-27.86, p = 0.02) and single infarction without ICAS (6.8% vs 1.3%, HR 4.65, 95% CI 1.05-20.64, p = 0.04) were all associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke at 90 days. Patients with both multiple infarctions and ICAS were associated with approximately 13-fold risk of ischemic stroke at 90 days (18.0% vs 1.3%, HR 13.14, 95% CI 2.96-58.36, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of multiple infarctions and ICAS were both associated with an increased risk of 90-day ischemic stroke in patients with minor stroke or TIA, while the presence of both imaging features had a combined effect.

METHODS: From a historical cohort of 96,942 consecutive patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT between October 2008 and September 2015, 1342 patients with 1364 nodules underwent ultrasound evaluation for focal uptake in thyroid gland, with a final diagnosis made for 877 patients with 907 nodules, which were included in this study. Ultrasound images were retrospectively reviewed, and they were stratified according to the American Thyroid Association and Korean Thyroid Image Reporting and Data System guidelines. The calculated malignancy risks were compared with the estimated risks suggested by the guidelines.
RESULTS: The overall malignancy risk of thyroid incidentalomas detected on 18F-FDG PET/CT was 54.7%. When stratified according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines, the malignancy risks of thyroid incidentalomas with high and intermediate suspicion (93.2% and 45.2%, respectively) were higher than those indicated in the guidelines. The malignancy risks of thyroid incidentalomas with low and very low suspicion (8.1% and 0%, respectively) were within the guideline ranges. These findings were also noted when thyroid incidentalomas were stratified according to the Korean Thyroid Image Reporting and Data System, and in a subgroup of nodules &gt;1 cm.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound examinations can be used to stratify the malignancy risk of thyroid incidentalomas detected on 18F-FDG PET/CT. The risk of malignancy did not increase in thyroid incidentalomas with low and very low suspicion, indicating that only selective biopsies may be needed in these categories of thyroid incidentalomas."

The authors' primary goal for the use of a computer-aided resource was to offer students another way to assess their performance, to enhance their learning, and to potentially decrease their learning curve in the preclinical environment prior to using the technique in clinical patient care. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the ""% Comparison"" numbers derived from the E4D Compare software program. Three practical examinations were administered to a class of 82 students at one U.S. dental school over a six-week period. The grading of the practical examinations was performed with individual faculty members being responsible for evaluating specific aspects of each preparation. A digital image of each student's practical examination tooth was then obtained and compared to the digital image of an ideal preparation. The preparations were compared, and the ""% Comparison"" was recorded at five tolerance levels. Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC) was used to measure the agreement in rankings between the faculty scores on practical exams 1-3 and the scores obtained using E4D Compare at the different tolerance levels. The SCC values for practical exams 2 and 3 were all between 0.2 and 0.4; for practical exam 1, the SCC values ranged from 0.47 to 0.56. There was no correlation between the faculty scores and the numbers given by the ""% Comparison"" of the software."

Epub 2015 Oct 1.,Malmberg C,J Nucl Med,2015,2015/10/03,,,10.2967/jnumed.115.161216,"UNLABELLED: The somatostatin receptor subtype 2 is expressed on macrophages, an abundant cell type in the atherosclerotic plaque. Visualization of somatostatin receptor subtype 2, for oncologic purposes, is frequently made using the DOTA-derived somatostatin analogs DOTATOC or DOTATATE for PET. We aimed to compare the uptake of the PET tracers (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (64)Cu-DOTATATE in large arteries, in the assessment of atherosclerosis by noninvasive imaging technique, combining PET and CT. Further, the correlation of uptake and cardiovascular risk factors was investigated.
METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients with neuroendocrine tumors underwent both (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (64)Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT scans, in random order. For each scan, the maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated in 5 arterial segments. In addition, the blood-pool-corrected target-to-background ratio was calculated. Uptake of the tracers was correlated with cardiovascular risk factors collected from medical records.
RESULTS: We found detectable uptake of both tracers in all arterial segments studied. Uptake of (64)Cu-DOTATATE was significantly higher than (68)Ga-DOTATOC in the vascular regions both when calculated as maximum and mean uptake. There was a significant association between Framingham risk score and the overall maximum uptake of (64)Cu-DOTATATE using SUV (r = 0.4; P = 0.004) as well as target-to-background ratio (r = 0.3; P = 0.04), whereas no association was found with (68)Ga-DOTATOC. The association of risk factors and maximum SUV of (64)Cu-DOTATATE was found driven by body mass index, smoking, diabetes, and coronary calcium score (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, P = 0.005, and P = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In a series of oncologic patients, vascular uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATOC and (64)Cu-DOTATATE was found, with highest uptake of the latter. Uptake of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, but not of (68)Ga-DOTATOC, was correlated with cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting a potential role for (64)Cu-DOTATATE in the assessment of atherosclerosis."

Epub 2014 Nov 26.,Peteiro J,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,2015,2014/11/28,,,10.1093/ehjci/jeu225,"AIMS: We have observed that wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) during exercise echocardiography (ExE) are associated to events in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our objective was to evaluate ExE and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to predict outcome in HCM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: ExE and CMR were performed in 148 patients with HCM. During follow-up (7.1 ± 2.7 years), there were 7 hard events (Hard-E) and 26 combined events (Comb-E). Exercise WMAs were observed in 13 patients (8.8%), perfusion defects in 10 (6.8%), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in 48 (32.4%). WMAs were seen in 57% of patients with Hard-E vs. 6% without (P = 0.001) and in 23 and 6% with and without Comb-E (P = 0.005). Perfusion defects were also more frequent in patients with Hard-E than without (43 vs. 5%, P = 0.007) and in patients with Comb-E than without (23 vs. 5%, P = 0.002). LGE (g) was greater in patients with Comb-E than without [median (25th-75th percentile) 0 (0-21.1) vs. 0 (0-9.3) g P = 0.04]. Univariable predictors of Comb-E included NYHA class ≥2, peak double product, ΔWMSI, and CMR data. Peak double product [Hazard ratios (HR) = 0.99, confidence intervals (CI) 95% 0.99-0.99, P = 0.02] and ΔWMSI (HR = 404, CI 95% 12-13681, P = 0.001) remained independent predictors. Peak WMSI correlated with myocardial mass with LGE (r = 0.20, P = 0.02) and with perfusion defect area (r = 0.40, P < 0.001). LGE affecting ≥15% of the left ventricle was observed in 38% of patients with exercise WMAs vs. 12% without (P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: CMR data are associated to exercise WMAs in patients with HCM. ExE and CMR may help to predict outcome in them."

The CARE ""Advanced Research Core"" (ARC), is focused on executing a cutting-edge investigative protocol on a subset of the overall CARE athlete population. Here, we present the details of the CARE ARC MRI acquisition and processing protocol along with preliminary analyzes of within-subject, between-site, and between-subject stability across a variety of MRI biomarkers. Two experimental datasets were utilized for this analysis. First, two ""human phantom"" subjects were imaged multiple times at each of the four CARE ARC imaging sites, which utilize equipment from two imaging vendors. Additionally, a control cohort of healthy athletes participating in non-contact sports were enrolled in the study at each CARE ARC site and imaged at four time points. Multiple morphological image contrasts were acquired in each MRI exam; along with quantitative diffusion, functional, perfusion, and relaxometry imaging metrics. As expected, the imaging markers were found to have varying levels of stability throughout the brain. Importantly, between-subject variance was generally found to be greater than within-subject and between-site variance. These results lend support to the expectation that cross-site and cross-vendor advanced quantitative MRI metrics can be utilized to improve analytic power in assessing sensitive neurological variations; such as those effects hypothesized to occur in sports-related-concussion. This stability analysis provides a crucial foundation for further work utilizing this expansive dataset, which will ultimately be freely available through the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research Informatics System."

Epub 2016 Feb 4.,Klein R,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,2017,2016/02/07,,,10.1093/ehjci/jev357,"AIMS: To determine the influence of cardiac motion on measurements of left ventricular (LV) mass obtained with 64-slice computed tomography (CT) and to elucidate the prognostic value of LV mass on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. Increased LV mass has been linked with MACE. Although Cardiac CT allows measurement of LV anatomy, it is susceptible to motion artefacts often requiring image acquisition during diastasis. There is a need to understand variability in LV mass measurements across phases of the cardiac cycle, and whether mid-diastolic measurements have prognostic value.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study comprised two equally sized cohorts of patients that had undergone retrospectively gated cardiac CT: patients who had MACE and/or all-cause death at follow-up and a matched (age, sex, and risk factors) event-free cohort. LV mass was measured at mid-diastole, end-diastole, and end-systole. Correlation and agreement between phases were determined. The incremental value of mid-diastolic hypertrophy (LVH) over the National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) risk was performed for LV mass indices normalized to body surface area (LVMI<sub>BSA</sub>) or weight (LVMI<sub>Weight</sub>). Of 166 patients, 31.3% experienced MACE and 28.9% died of any cause (follow-up 22.9 ± 13.4 months). LV mass at all cardiac phases were strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.94). Mean mid-diastolic LVMI<sub>BSA</sub> was higher in the cohort with events (93.7 vs. 80.7 g/m2, P= 0.008) as was LVMI<sub>Weight</sub> (2.26 vs. 1.88 g/kg, P = 0.001). LVMI<sub>BSA</sub> and LVMI<sub>Weight</sub> had prognostic value incremental to NCEP with 1.85 and 2.47 hazard ratios, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of LV mass can be obtained by cardiac CT images obtained at mid-diastasis. LV mass measurements obtained at mid-diastasis have prognostic value."

METHODS: Seven hundred ninety-eight patients (404 BV and 394 placebo) with newly diagnosed GBM in the AVAglio trial (NCT00943826) had baseline MRI scans available, while 337 BV-treated and 269 placebo-treated patients had >4 MRI scans for response evaluation. The volume of contrast-enhancing tumor was quantified and used for subsequent analyses.
RESULTS: A decrease in tumor volume during chemoradiation was associated with a longer OS in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.578, P < 0.0001) but not BV-treated group (HR = 1.135, P = 0.4889). Results showed a higher OS in patients on the placebo arm with a sustained decrease in tumor volume using a post-chemoradiation baseline (HR = 1.692, P = 0.0005), and a trend toward longer OS was seen in BV-treated patients (HR = 1.264, P = 0.0724). Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that sustained response or stable disease was prognostic for OS (HR = 0.7509, P = 0.0127) when accounting for age (P = 0.0002), KPS (P = 0.1516), postsurgical tumor volume (P < 0.0001), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase status (P < 0.0001), and treatment type (P = 0.7637) using the post-chemoradiation baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: The post-chemoradiation timepoint is a better baseline for evaluating efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM. Early progression during the maintenance phase is consequential in predicting OS, supporting the use of progression-free survival rates as a meaningful surrogate for GBM."

Our objective was to compare the rate of respiratory complications in patients with COPD with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Low-to-intermediate surgical-risk patients with moderate or severe COPD who underwent TAVI or SAVR at 2 tertiary centers were included in this study. COPD was defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease classification. The primary end point was the 30-day composite of respiratory mortality, prolonged ventilation (>24 hours), the need for reintubation for respiratory causes, tracheostomy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, or pneumothorax. The inverse probability of treatment weighting was determined to reduce baseline imbalance between the 2 groups. A total of 321 patients (mean age 72.4 ± 9.3 years old, 74.5% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality 3.8 ± 1.9%, mean forced expiratory volume 1: 59 ± 13%) were included in the analysis. TAVI was performed in 122 patients, whereas 199 underwent SAVR. There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding the composite respiratory primary end point (SAVR 10.6%, TAVR 7.4%, adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 1.65, p = 0.30). Transfemoral TAVI without general anesthesia (28 patients) was associated with the lowest rate of respiratory complications (3.6%). Among patients with moderate or severe COPD at low-to-intermediate surgical risk, TAVI patients had a similar rate of 30-day major pulmonary complications compared with SAVR patients despite a higher baseline risk profile. Future studies should further investigate whether TAVI is associated with reduced respiratory complications, comparing transfemoral TAVI recipients treated with local anesthesia with their SAVR counterparts."

METHODS: 112 subjects with correlative coronary angiographic data and 40 subjects with <5% pre-test likelihood of coronary disease completed attenuation-corrected stress-only images on a conventional Anger camera and uncorrected upright and supine stress images on a CZT camera. Two readers provided independent, blinded interpretations of stress-only images.
RESULTS: Upright and supine stress-only CZT images and attenuation-corrected Anger camera images provided similar positive (reader 1/reader 2, 50.0%/44.1% vs 46.4%/51.9%) and negative (66.7%/64.0% vs 67.9%/67.7%) predictive values (all P = NS) for obstructive coronary artery disease; however, the sensitivity was higher (81.3% vs 58.3%, P = .05), specificity lower (29.7% vs 50.0%, P = .005), and normalcy rate lower (87.5% vs 100%, P = .025) with attenuation-corrected Anger camera images for the first reader with no significant differences between cameras for the second reader.
CONCLUSIONS: Stress-only upright and supine CZT imaging was non-inferior statistically to attenuation-corrected stress-only Anger camera imaging. Nevertheless, stress-only CZT imaging may be associated with reduced diagnostic sensitivity for some readers compared to attenuation-corrected Anger camera images, which may be less acceptable clinically compared to stress plus rest images."

Machine learning may support radiologists reading whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.
OBJECTIVES: 1. To develop a machine-learning algorithm to detect normal organs and cancer lesions. 2. To compare diagnostic accuracy, time and agreement of radiology reads to detect metastases using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging with concurrent machine learning (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning) against standard whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation).
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of (1) prospective single-centre study in healthy volunteers &gt; 18 years (n = 51) and (2) prospective multicentre STREAMLINE study patient data (n = 438).
TESTS: Index: whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning. Comparator: whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation.
REFERENCE STANDARD: Previously established expert panel consensus reference at 12 months from diagnosis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: difference in per-patient specificity between whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation. Secondary: per-patient sensitivity, per-lesion sensitivity and specificity, read time and agreement.
METHODS: Phase 1: classification forests, convolutional neural networks, and a multi-atlas approaches for organ segmentation. Phase 2/3: whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scans were allocated to Phase 2 (training = 226, validation = 45) and Phase 3 (testing = 193). Disease sites were manually labelled. The final algorithm was applied to 193 Phase 3 cases, generating probability heatmaps. Twenty-five radiologists (18 experienced, 7 inexperienced in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging) were randomly allocated whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning or whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation over two or three rounds in a National Health Service setting. Read time was independently recorded.
RESULTS: Phases 1 and 2: convolutional neural network had best Dice similarity coefficient, recall and precision measurements for healthy organ segmentation. Final algorithm used a ‘two-stage’ initial organ identification followed by lesion detection. Phase 3: evaluable scans (188/193, of which 50 had metastases from 117 colon, 71 lung cancer cases) were read between November 2019 and March 2020. For experienced readers, per-patient specificity for detection of metastases was 86.2% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning) and 87.7% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation), (difference −1.5%, 95% confidence interval −6.4% to 3.5%; p = 0.387); per-patient sensitivity was 66.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning) and 70.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation) (difference −4.0%, 95% confidence interval −13.5% to 5.5%; p = 0.344). For inexperienced readers (53 reads, 15 with metastases), per-patient specificity was 76.3% in both groups with sensitivities of 73.3% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning) and 60.0% (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation). Per-site specificity remained high within all sites; above 95% (experienced) or 90% (inexperienced). Per-site sensitivity was highly variable due to low number of lesions in each site. Reading time lowered under machine learning by 6.2% (95% confidence interval −22.8% to 10.0%). Read time was primarily influenced by read round with round 2 read times reduced by 32% (95% confidence interval 20.8% to 42.8%) overall with subsequent regression analysis showing a significant effect (p = 0.0281) by using machine learning in round 2 estimated as 286 seconds (or 11%) quicker. Interobserver variance for experienced readers suggests moderate agreement, Cohen’s κ = 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning) and Cohen’s κ = 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.81 (whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + standard deviation).
LIMITATIONS: Patient whole-body magnetic resonance imaging data were heterogeneous with relatively few metastatic lesions in a wide variety of locations, making training and testing difficult and hampering evaluation of sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy for whole-body magnetic resonance imaging radiology reads with or without machine-learning support, although radiology read time may be slightly shortened using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging + machine learning.
FUTURE WORK: Failure-case analysis to improve model training, automate lesion segmentation and transfer of machine-learning techniques to other tumour types and imaging modalities.

The distribution of abdominal adipose tissue at birth may give insights into whether ethnicity-associated variations in metabolic risk originate partly in utero.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the influence of ethnicity on abdominal adipose tissue compartments in Asian neonates in the Growing Up in Singapore Toward Healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort.
DESIGN: MRI was performed at ≤2 wk after birth in 333 neonates born at ≥34 wk of gestation and with birth weights ≥2000 g. Abdominal superficial subcutaneous tissue (sSAT), deep subcutaneous tissue (dSAT), and internal adipose tissue (IAT) compartment volumes (absolute and as a percentage of the total abdominal volume) were quantified.
RESULTS: In multivariate analyses that were controlled for sex, age, and parity, the absolute and percentage of dSAT and the percentage of sSAT (but not absolute sSAT) were greater, whereas absolute IAT (but not the percentage of IAT) was lower, in Indian neonates than in Chinese neonates. Compared with Chinese neonates, Malay neonates had greater percentages of sSAT and dSAT but similar percentages of IAT. Marginal structural model analyses largely confirmed the results on the basis of volume percentages with controlled direct effects of ethnicity on abdominal adipose tissue; dSAT was significantly greater (1.45 mL; 95% CI: 0.49, 2.41 mL, P = 0.003) in non-Chinese (Indian or Malay) neonates than in Chinese neonates. However, ethnic differences in sSAT and IAT were NS [3.06 mL (95% CI:-0.27, 6.39 mL; P = 0.0712) for sSAT and -1.30 mL (95% CI: -2.64, 0.04 mL; P = 0.057) for IAT in non-Chinese compared with Chinese neonates, respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: Indian and Malay neonates have a greater dSAT volume than do Chinese neonates. This finding supports the notion that in utero influences may contribute to higher cardiometabolic risk observed in Indian and Malay persons in our population. If such differences persist in the longitudinal tracking of adipose tissue growth, these differences may contribute to the ethnic disparities in risks of cardiometabolic diseases. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875."

However, a subset of patients having angiogenesis-dependent tumors might benefit from these therapies. Currently, there are no biomarkers allowing to discriminate responders from non-responders before the start of the therapy.
METHODS: 40 patients from the randomized GENOM009 study complied the inclusion criteria (quality of images, clinical data available). Of those, 23 patients received first line temozolomide (TMZ) for eight weeks and then concomitant radiotherapy and TMZ. 17 patients received BVZ+TMZ for seven weeks and then added radiotherapy to the treatment. Clinical variables were collected, tumors segmented and several geometrical measures computed including: Contrast enhancing (CE), necrotic, and total volumes; equivalent spherical CE width; several geometric measures of the CE 'rim' geometry and a set of image texture measures. The significance of the results was studied using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Correlations were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients.
RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that total, CE and inner volume (p = 0.019, HR = 4.258) and geometric heterogeneity of the CE areas (p = 0.011, HR = 3.931) were significant parameters identifying response to BVZ. The group of patients with either regular CE areas (small geometric heterogeneity, median difference survival 15.88 months, p = 0.011) or those with small necrotic volume (median survival difference 14.50 months, p = 0.047) benefited substantially from BVZ.
CONCLUSION: Imaging biomarkers related to the irregularity of contrast enhancing areas and the necrotic volume were able to discriminate GBM patients with a substantial survival benefit from BVZ. A prospective study is needed to validate our results."

METHODS: We assessed youths with ADHD and age-, sex-, handedness-, coil- and intelligence-matched controls using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CCPT) for attention performance and MRI. The 10 target tracts, including the bilateral frontostriatal tracts (caudate to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle were reconstructed using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography. We computed generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values to indicate tract-specific microstructural property.
RESULTS: We included 50 youths with ADHD and 50 healthy controls in our study. Youths with ADHD had lower GFA in the left frontostriatal tracts, bilateral SLF and right cingulum bundle and performed worse in the CCPT than controls. Furthermore, alteration of the right SLF GFA was most significantly associated with the clinical symptom of inattention in youths with ADHD. Finally, youths with ADHD had differential association patterns of the 10 fibre tract GFA values with attention performance compared with controls.
LIMITATIONS: Ten of the youths with ADHD were treated with methylphenidate, which may have long-term effects on microstructural property.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of the SLF, cingulum bundle and frontostriatal tracts for clinical symptoms and attention performance in youths with ADHD and demonstrates the involvement of different fibre tracts in attention performance in these individuals."

DESIGN: In this study, we included 57 male adolescents from the youth academy of a professional soccer team. The MRI scans were acquired of the knee joint of the supporting leg. An ""early unloading"" (minute 0) and ""late unloading"" (minute 28) T2-sequence was included in the set of images. Quantitative T2-analysis was performed in the femorotibial joint cartilage in 4 slices with each 10 regions of interest (ROIs). Statistical evaluation, using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, was primarily performed to compare the T2 values of the ""early unloading"" and ""late unloading.""
RESULTS: When comparing ""early unloading"" with ""late unloading,"" our findings showed a significant increase of T2-relaxation times in the weightbearing femoral cartilage of the medial (P &lt; 0.001) and lateral (P &lt; 0.001) compartment of the knee and in the tibial cartilage of the medial compartment (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In this study, alterations of the cartilage were found with a maximum in the medial condyle where the biomechanical load of the knee joint is highest, as well as where most of the chronic cartilage lesions occur. To avoid chronic damage, special focus should be laid on this region."

OBJECTIVE: To compare patient characteristics, diagnostics, treatment, and quality indicators of dementia care among patients referred to specialist units in Sweden and Denmark.
METHODS: Data from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) and the Danish Dementia Registry were merged. Newly diagnosed dementia cases referred to memory clinics during 2007-2012 were included (19,629 Swedish and 6,576 Danish patients).
RESULTS: The median duration between initial assessment and confirmed diagnosis was 56 and 57 days in Sweden and Denmark, respectively. Brain imaging using MRI was twice as common in Sweden. A diagnosis of dementia was established at an average MMSE of 21. An etiological diagnosis was concluded in 89.6% of the Swedish and 87.3% of the Danish cases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was the most common disorder (47.7% in Denmark and 36.6% in Sweden); however, more cases were diagnosed as mixed AD in Sweden (24.7% versus 10.6% ). More than 80% of patients with AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease with dementia were treated with anti-dementia drugs.
CONCLUSION: The targets of several quality indicators in both registries were met, such that structural brain imaging and MMSE were performed in >90% and an etiological diagnosis was concluded in >80% of the patients. However, there were also results of concern. The diagnosis of dementia was established at a mean MMSE of 21, which is already late in the course of most dementia disorders. A higher chance of vascular findings following the higher rate of MRI in Sweden may have resulted in more mixed AD diagnosis, which could be one explanation for diagnostic differences but also highlights the need to harmonize diagnostic criteria."

METHODS: Data from 1511 newly diagnosed GBM patients from 5 data sources were included in the current study: (i) a single institution database from UCLA (N = 398; Discovery); (ii) patients from the Ben and Cathy Ivy Foundation for Early Phase Clinical Trials Network Radiogenomics Database (N = 262 from 8 centers; Confirmation); (iii) the chemoradiation placebo arm from an international phase III trial (AVAglio; N = 394 from 120 locations in 23 countries; Validation); (iv) the experimental arm from AVAglio examining chemoradiation plus bevacizumab (N = 404 from 120 locations in 23 countries; Exploratory Set 1); and (v) an Alliance (N0874) phase I/II trial of vorinostat plus chemoradiation (N = 53; Exploratory Set 2). Postsurgical, residual enhancing disease was quantified using T1 subtraction maps. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine influence of clinical variables, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, and residual tumor volume on OS.
RESULTS: A log-linear relationship was observed between postoperative, residual enhancing tumor volume and OS in newly diagnosed GBM treated with standard chemoradiation. Postoperative tumor volume is a prognostic factor for OS (P < 0.01), regardless of therapy, age, and MGMT promoter methylation status.
CONCLUSION: Postsurgical, residual contrast-enhancing disease significantly negatively influences survival in patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with chemoradiation with or without concomitant experimental therapy."

Epub 2024 Aug 2.,Querido NR,Clin Nutr ESPEN,2024,2024/08/04,,,10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.07.1054,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several automated programs have been developed to facilitate body composition analysis of images from abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. External validation in patients with colorectal cancer is necessary for use in research and clinical practice. Our aim was to validate an automatic method (AutoMATiCA) of segmenting CT images at the third lumbar level (L3) from patients with colorectal cancer, by comparing with manual segmentation.
METHODS: Diagnostic abdominal CT scans of consecutive patients with stage I-III colorectal cancer were analysed to measure cross-sectional areas and tissue densities of skeletal muscle and intra-muscular, visceral, and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Trained analysts performed manual segmentation of L3 CT images using SliceOmatic. Automatic segmentation was performed using AutoMATiCA, an open-source software. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to assess segmentation accuracy. Agreement of automatic with manual segmentation was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots with limits of agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 292 scans were included, of which 62% were from male patients. The agreement of AutoMATiCA with the manual segmentation was excellent, with median DSC values ranging from 0.900 to 0.991 and ICCs above 0.95 for all segmented areas. No systematic deviations were observed in Bland-Altman plots for all segmented areas, with overall narrow limits of agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: AutoMATiCA provides an accurate segmentation of abdominal CT images from patients with colorectal cancer. Our findings support its use as a highly efficient automated tool for body composition analysis in research and potentially also in clinical practice."

METHODS: We included a consecutive series of 87,487 digital screening mammograms, obtained between July 2009 and July 2011. Screening mammograms were double read in either a blinded (2nd reader was not informed about the 1st reader's decision) or non-blinded fashion (2nd reader was informed about the 1st reader's decision). This reading strategy was alternated on a monthly basis. Women with discrepant readings between the two radiologists were always referred for further analysis. During 2 years follow-up, we collected the radiology reports, surgical correspondence and pathology reports of all referred women and interval breast cancers.
RESULTS: Respectively 44,491 and 42,996 screens had been read either in a blinded or non-blinded fashion. Referral rate (3.3% versus 2.8%, p<0.001) and false positive rate (2.6% versus 2.2%, p=0.002) were significantly higher at blinded double reading whereas the cancer detection rate per 1000 screens (7.4 versus 6.5, p=0.14) and positive predictive value of referral (22% versus 23%, p=0.51) were comparable. Blinded double reading resulted in a significantly higher programme sensitivity (83% versus 76%, p=0.01). Per 1000 screened women, blinded double reading would yield 0.9 more screen detected cancers and 0.6 less interval cancers than non-blinded double reading, at the expense of 4.4 more recalls.
CONCLUSION: We advocate the use of blinded double reading in order to achieve a better programme sensitivity, at the expense of an increased referral rate and false positive referral rate."

Epub 2014 Sep 21.,Buss SJ,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,2015,2014/09/24,,,10.1093/ehjci/jeu181,"AIMS: To investigate the prognostic impact of left-ventricular (LV) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) deformation imaging in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) compared with late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) quantification and LV ejection fraction (EF).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 210 subjects with DCM were examined prospectively with standard CMR including measurement of LGE for quantification of myocardial fibrosis and feature tracking strain imaging for assessment of LV deformation. The predefined primary endpoint, a combination of cardiac death, heart transplantation, and aborted sudden cardiac death, occurred in 26 subjects during the median follow-up period of 5.3 years. LV radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strains were significantly associated with outcome. Using separate multivariate analysis models, global longitudinal strain (average of peak negative strain values) and mean longitudinal strain (negative peak of the mean curve of all segments) were independent prognostic parameters surpassing the value of global and mean LV radial and circumferential strain, as well as NT-proBNP, EF, and LGE mass. A global longitudinal strain greater than -12.5% predicted outcome even in patients with EF < 35% (P < 0.01) and in those with presence of LGE (P < 0.001). Mean longitudinal strain was further investigated using a clinical model with predefined cut-offs (EF < 35%, presence of LGE, NYHA class, mean longitudinal strain greater than -10%). Mean longitudinal strain exhibited an independent prognostic value surpassing that provided by NYHA, EF, and LGE (HR = 5.4, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: LV longitudinal strain assessed with CMR is an independent predictor of survival in DCM and offers incremental information for risk stratification beyond clinical parameters, biomarker, and standard CMR."

Epub 2015 Feb 16.,Ostwaldt AC,J Neuroimaging,2015,2015/02/17,,,10.1111/jon.12224,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Visibility of lesions on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images appears indicative of the time window in acute ischemic stroke. We compared two published methods for calculation of relative FLAIR signal intensities (rSI) regarding their association with time from symptom onset in a longitudinal fashion.
METHODS: We prospectively included patients receiving serial MRI examinations between 4.5 and 35 hours from symptom onset. FLAIR rSI was determined using two methods: a whole regions-of-interest (ROI) method and a hotspot method, selecting only a single area of visually highest signal. Signal intensity (rSI) was calculated relative to the contralateral side for each time point.
RESULTS: We included 21 patients with 3-6 MRI examinations on the first 2 days after stroke onset. FLAIR rSI determined with both methods shows a linear association with time from onset, although the hotspot results showed higher variability. Both methods with their previously published thresholds are reliable for identifying patients outside the 4.5 hours time window.
CONCLUSION: Both methods show a similar performance, and might be a suitable help for the visual assessment of FLAIR lesion visibility."

High-resolution T2(∗)-weighted scans were acquired in 12 EOAD patients and 17 LOAD patients with mild to moderate disease and 27 healthy elderly control subjects. Lobar peak-to-peak phase shifts and regional mean phase contrasts were computed. An increased peak-to-peak phase shift was found for all lobar regions in EOAD patients compared with LOAD patients (p < 0.05). Regional mean phase contrast in EOAD patients was higher than in LOAD patients in the superior medial and middle frontal gyrus, anterior and middle cingulate gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior and inferior parietal gyrus, and precuneus (p ≤ 0.042). These data suggest that EOAD patients have an increased iron accumulation, possibly related to an increased amyloid deposition, in specific cortical regions as compared with LOAD patients."

METHODS: Noncontrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were acquired from 32 healthy women. Each subject received four MR scans using different experimental settings, including a high resolution hands-up, a low resolution hands-up, a high resolution hands-down, and finally, another high resolution hands-up after repositioning. The breast segmentation was performed using a fully automatic chest template-based method. The breast volume (BV), fibroglandular tissue volume (FV), and percent density (PD) measured from the four MR scan settings were analyzed.
RESULTS: A high correlation of BV, FV, and PD between any pair of the four MR scans was noted (r > 0.98 for all). Using the generalized estimating equation method, a statistically significant difference in mean BV among four settings was noted (left breast, score test p = 0.0056; right breast, score test p = 0.0016), adjusted for age and body mass index. Despite differences in BV, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean PDs among the four settings (p > 0.10 for left and right breasts). Using Bland-Altman plots, the smallest mean difference/bias and standard deviations for BV, FV, and PD were noted when comparing hands-up high vs low resolution when the breast positions were exactly the same.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study showed that BV, FV, and PD measurements from MRI of different positions were highly correlated. BV may vary with positions but the measured PD did not differ significantly between positions. The study suggested that the percent density analyzed from MRI studies acquired using different arms/hands and body positions from multiple centers can be combined for analysis."

It is suggested that right and left hippocampi are affected differentially in healthy or pathologic aging. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that verbal episodic memory performance is associated with left hippocampal volume (HV) while spatial memory is associated with right HV. 115 non-demented adults over age 70 were drawn from the Einstein Aging Study. Verbal memory was measured using the free recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test - immediate recall (FCSRT-IR), logical memory immediate and delayed subtests (LM-I and LM-II) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Spatial Memory was measured using a computerized dot memory paradigm that has been validated for use in older adults. All participants underwent 3T MRI with subsequent automatized measurement of the volume of each hippocampus. The sample had a mean age of 78.7 years (SD=5.0); 57% were women, and 52% were white. Participants had a mean of 14.3 years (SD=3.5) of education. In regression models, two tests of verbal memory (FCSRT-IR free recall and LM-II) were positively associated with left HV, but not with right HV. Performance on the spatial memory task was associated with right HV, but not left HV. Our findings support the hypothesis that the left hippocampus plays a critical role in episodic verbal memory, while right hippocampus might be more important for spatial memory processing among non-demented older adults."

Subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can be detected early after BC RT with global longitudinal strain (GLS) measurement based on 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography. This 6-month follow-up analysis from the BACCARAT prospective study aimed to investigate the association between cardiac radiation doses and subclinical LV dysfunction based on GLS reduction.
METHODS: The patient study group consisted of 79 BC patients (64 left-sided BC, 15 right-sided BC) treated with RT without chemotherapy. Echocardiographic parameters, including GLS, were measured before RT and 6 months post-RT. The association between subclinical LV dysfunction, defined as GLS reduction > 10%, and radiation doses to whole heart and the LV were performed based on logistic regressions. Non-radiation factors associated with subclinical LV dysfunction including age, BMI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and endocrine therapy were considered for multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: A mean decrease of 6% in GLS was observed (- 15.1% ± 3.2% at 6 months vs. - 16.1% ± 2.7% before RT, p = 0.01). For left-sided patients, mean heart and LV doses were 3.1 ± 1.3 Gy and 6.7 ± 3.4 Gy respectively. For right-sided patients, mean heart dose was 0.7 ± 0.5 Gy and median LV dose was 0.1 Gy. Associations between GLS reduction > 10% (37 patients) and mean doses to the heart and the LV as well as the V20 were observed in univariate analysis (Odds Ratio = 1.37[1.01-1.86], p = 0.04 for Dmean Heart; OR = 1.14 [1.01-1.28], p = 0.03 for Dmean LV; OR = 1.08 [1.01-1.14], p = 0.02 for LV V20). In multivariate analysis, these associations did not remain significant after adjustment for non-radiation factors. Further exploratory analysis allowed identifying a subgroup of patients (LV V20 > 15%) for whom a significant association with subclinical LV dysfunction was found (adjusted OR = 3.97 [1.01-15.70], p = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicated that subclinical LV dysfunction defined as a GLS decrease > 10% is associated with cardiac doses, but adjustment for non-radiation factors such as endocrine therapy lead to no longer statistically significant relationships. However, LV dosimetry may be promising to identify high-risk subpopulations. Larger and longer follow-up studies are required to further investigate these associations.

Epub 2018 Jul 4.,Allencherril J,Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,2018,2018/07/05,PMC6931512,,10.1111/anec.12580,"BACKGROUND: Anterolateral myocardial infarction (MI) is traditionally defined on the electrocardiogram by ST-elevation (STE) in I, aVL, and the precordial leads. Traditional literature holds STE in lead aVL to be associated with occlusion proximal to the first diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. However, concomitant ischemia of the inferior myocardium may theoretically lead to attenuation of STE in aVL. We compared segmental distribution of myocardial area at risk (MaR) in patients with and without STE in aVL.
METHODS: We identified patients in the MITOCARE study presenting with a first acute MI and new STE in two contiguous anterior leads from V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>6</sub> , with or without aVL STE. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 3-5 days after acute infarction for quantitative assessment of MaR.
RESULTS: A total of 32 patients met inclusion criteria; 13 patients with and 19 without STE in lead aVL. MaR > 20% at the basal anterior segment was seen in 54% of patients with aVL STE, and 11% of those without (p = 0.011). MaR > 20% at the apical inferior segment was seen in 62% and 95% of patients with and without aVL STE, respectively (p = 0.029). The total MaR was not different between groups (44% ± 10% and 39% ± 8.3% respectively, p = 0.15).
CONCLUSION: Patients with anterior STEMI and concomitant STE in aVL have less MaR in the apical inferior segment and more MaR in the basal anterior segment."

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was a substudy to the SORT-OUT VII trial, a prospective, 1:1-randomized, comparison of the two stents in patients with stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome. Optical coherence tomography was acquired after percutaneous coronary intervention and at 13-month follow-up. The substudy was powered to access non-inferiority (Δ = 0.60 mm2) of the Orsiro DES to the Nobori DES for the primary endpoint of mean extra stent lumen (ESL) i.e. vessel lumen outside the stent at 13-month follow-up. We randomized 124 patients to Orsiro (n = 60) or Nobori (n = 64). Due to a difference in the one-sided 95%-confidence interval of 0.26 mm2, but increased to 0.82 mm2 after appropriate log-transformation, it could not be rejected that Orsiro exceeded the non-inferiority limit. Testing for superiority, Orsiro had a significantly larger mean ESL at follow-up (Orsiro: 0.11 mm2 [0.02;0.30] mm2, Nobori: 0.03 mm2 [0.00;0.17] mm2, P = 0.04). Stent strut coverage was, Orsiro: 97.6 % [93.8;99.4]%, and Nobori: 96.3 % [90.5;98,6]% (P = 0.13).
CONCLUSION: Orsiro DES had a significantly larger mean ESL at follow-up and it could not be excluded that Orsiro exceeded the limit for non-inferiority. Nobori DES had a more heterogeneous distribution of neointima but stent strut coverage did not differ significantly between the two stents."

Current template-based automatic analyses still lack a comprehensive list of tract atlas and an accurate registration method. In this study, tract-based automatic analysis (TBAA) was developed to meet the demands. Seventy-six major white matter tracts were reconstructed on a high-quality diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) template, and an advanced two-step registration strategy was proposed by incorporating anatomical information of the gray matter from T1-weighted images in addition to microstructural information of the white matter from diffusion-weighted images. The automatic analysis was achieved by establishing a transformation between the DSI template and DSI dataset of the subject derived from the registration strategy. The tract coordinates in the template were transformed to native space in the individual's DSI dataset, and the microstructural properties of major tract bundles were sampled stepwise along the tract coordinates of the subject's DSI dataset. In a validation study of eight well-known tracts, our results showed that TBAA had high geometric agreement with manual tracts in both deep and superficial parts but significantly smaller measurement variability than manual method in functional difference. Additionally, the feasibility of the method was demonstrated by showing tracts with altered microstructural properties in patients with schizophrenia. Fifteen major tract bundles were found to have significant differences after controlling the family-wise error rate. In conclusion, the proposed TBAA method is potentially useful in brain-wise investigations of white matter tracts, particularly for a large cohort study."

This widespread pain is believed to be a marker of centralization, a central nervous system process that decouples pain perception from nociceptive input. Here, we investigated whether centralization is manifested at the level of the brain using data from 1079 participants in the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network (MAPP) study. Participants with a clinical diagnosis of urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) were compared to pain-free controls and patients with fibromyalgia, the prototypical centralized pain disorder. Participants completed questionnaires capturing pain severity, function, and a body map of pain. A subset (UCPPS N = 110; fibromyalgia N = 23; healthy control N = 49) underwent functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with UCPPS reported pain ranging from localized (pelvic) to widespread (throughout the body). Patients with widespread UCPPS displayed increased brain gray matter volume and functional connectivity involving sensorimotor and insular cortices (P < 0.05 corrected). These changes translated across disease diagnoses as identical outcomes were present in patients with fibromyalgia but not pain-free controls. Widespread pain was also associated with reduced physical and mental function independent of pain severity. Brain pathology in patients with centralized pain is related to pain distribution throughout the body. These patients may benefit from interventions targeting the central nervous system."

DESIGN: Before-and-after eating images using a 4 d mFR were assessed for standardised 600 kJ (143 kcal) servings of JF and SSB (excluding diet drinks). Participants reported their concern about the health aspects of their diet, perceptions and intentions regarding JF and SSB.
SETTING: Perth, Western Australia.
SUBJECTS: Adults (n 246) aged 18-30 years.
RESULTS: The mean (sd) intake of JF+SSB was 3·7 (2·0) servings/d. Women thinking about drinking less SSB consumed more SSB servings/d (1·5 (1·2)) than men (0·7 (0·5); P<0·05) who were thinking about drinking less. Men not thinking about cutting down JF consumed more servings/d (4·6 (2·4)) than women (2·5 (0·7); P<0·01) who were not thinking about cutting down. Those who paid a lot of attention to the health aspects of their diet consumed less JF+SSB than those who took only a bit of notice (P<0·001), were not really thinking much about it (P<0·001) or who didn't think at all about the health aspects of food (P<0·01).
CONCLUSIONS: Perceptions and attitudes regarding JF and SSB were associated with level of consumption. Those not thinking about cutting down their intake of these foods represent an important target group as they consume more than their peers. Further research is needed to identify how amenable young adults are to changing their intake, particularly given the lack of attention paid to the health aspects of their diet."

We evaluated intraoperative fluorescence based on tumor pathology, pretreatment as well as surgical and neurological outcome in patients with recurrent gliomas. Patients who underwent fluorescence-guided surgery for recurrent gliomas between 6/2010 and 2/2014 at our institution were retrospectively selected. Degree of surgical resection, neurological status, pathology results, intraoperative fluorescence and follow up status were analyzed. Patients who underwent repeat surgery without 5-ALA were selected as controls. 58 patients with high grade gliomas (°III and °IV) were included. 10 of 63 tumors (15.9 %) failed to fluoresce intraoperatively of which nine (90 %) had been adjuvantly treated prior to recurrence, as were 46 of the 53 fluorescing tumors (86.8 %). Non-fluorescing tumors were IDH mutated significantly more often (p = 0.005). 30 tumors (47.6 %) were located eloquently. 51 (80.9 %) patients showed no new neurologic deficits postoperatively. 13 patients (20.6 %) showed no signs of recurrence at their latest follow up. Eight patients were lost to follow up. Overall survival was significantly longer in the 5-ALA group (p = 0.025). Fluorescence-guided surgery in recurrent gliomas is safe and allows for a good surgical and neurological outcome in a difficult surgical environment, especially when used in combination with neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound to prevent over-resection. Adjuvant therapy did not significantly influence fluorescing properties."

However, the accuracy on the estimation of residual aneurysm, which is crucial for the retreatment planning, remains to be controversial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new post-processing technique that provides improved estimation of the residual aneurysm after coil embolization. One hundred aneurysms on 93 patients who underwent coil embolization for brain aneurysm were evaluated using the 1.5 Tesla time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (TR-MRA) one year after the treatment. To minimize the inter-observer variability caused by the window level adjustment, an automatic post processing protocol using the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) value was utilized. The result was then compared with that from the conventional cerebral angiography. Of the 97 aneurysms that underwent both TR-MRA and DSA, 23 (23.7%) showed residual neck / dome during follow-up. After window level adjustment, the size of the parent artery in the TR-MRA was consistent with that in the DSA. The reconstructed Volume Rendering images provided clear contours of the residual aneurysms and contributed to the understanding the configuration of residual aneurysm. The largest and the smallest diameter of the residual aneurysms was larger in the TR-MRA than in the DSA (8.05 vs. 7.72 mm, p = 0.0004; 4.99 vs. 4.19 mm, p = 0.007 respectively). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of TR-MRA compared to DSA were 100%, 97%, 73%, and 100%, respectively. Using the FWHM value to optimize the window level adjustment, the size of the residual component observed in the TR-MRA was larger compared to that in the DSA whereas the size of neck and the parent artery showed consistency between the two modalities. This image processing technique can be used as an effective screening tool for evaluating residual component in post-coiling brain aneurysms."

This phase I/II study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of VB-111 with and without bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM).
METHODS: Patients with rGBM (n = 72) received VB-111 in 4 treatment groups: subtherapeutic (VB-111 dose escalation), limited exposure (LE; VB-111 monotherapy until progression), primed combination (VB-111 monotherapy continued upon progression with combination of bevacizumab), and unprimed combination (upfront combination of VB-111 and bevacizumab). The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were safety, overall response rate, and progression-free survival (PFS).
RESULTS: VB-111 was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was transient mild-moderate fever. Median OS time was significantly longer in the primed combination group compared with both LE (414 vs 223 days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; P = 0.043) and unprimed combination (414 vs 141.5 days; HR, 0.24; P = 0.0056). Patients in the combination phase of the primed combination group had a median PFS time of 90 days compared with 60 in the LE group (HR, 0.36; P = 0.032), and 63 in the unprimed combination group (P = 0.72). Radiographic responders to VB-111 exhibited characteristic, expansive areas of necrosis in the areas of initial enhancing disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rGBM who were primed with VB-111 monotherapy that continued after progression with the addition of bevacizumab showed significant survival and PFS advantage, as well as specific imaging characteristics related to VB-111 mechanism of action. These results warrant further assessment in a randomized controlled study."

Epub 2016 May 10.,Maudet A,Ann Vasc Surg,2016,2016/05/14,,,10.1016/j.avsg.2015.12.020,"BACKGROUND: The stent grafts used for endovascular abdominal aortic repair (EVAR) profited from many technological changes since their appearance. The objective of this study was to compare the medium-term results of the second- and third-generation stent grafts.
METHODS: Three hundred thirty-four patients treated by EVAR between 2005 and 2013 were included in this retrospective study. Demographic, anatomical, perioperative, and follow-up data were collected in a prospective way in an electronic database and compared between 2 groups. The preoperative angio-computed tomographies were all analyzed in depth on a suitable three-dimensional work station. Group 1 (n = 219) represented the patients treated by second-generation stent grafts (Medtronic Talent(®), Cook Medical Zenith Flex(®), Vascutek-Terumo Anaconda(®), Gore Excluder low-porosity(®)) and group 2 (n = 115) represented the patients treated with third-generation stent grafts (Medtronic Enduring I and II(®), Cook Medical Zenith LP(®), Gore Excluder C3(®)).
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 42.4 ± 26.8 months with a longer duration in group 1 (52.4 ± 27.2 vs. 23.2 ± 10.9 months, P < 0.0001). The patients of group 2 had significantly more risk factors and cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary disease, tobacco addiction, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, chronic renal insufficiency). Anatomical characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, in particular regarding the iliac arteries which were significantly more calcified and had a smaller diameter in group 2. The rate of perioperative complications was similar in the 2 groups, in particular for complications related to the iliac axes (3.7% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.96). During the follow-up, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the rates of survival, reinterventions, or endoleaks and the progression of the aneurysmal sac.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that third-generation stent grafts allow results comparable with those of the second-generation stent grafts in spite of more complex iliac anatomies. These results make it possible to expand the indications of EVAR to patients presenting more cardiovascular comorbidities without increasing the risk of complications in the short and medium term."

In this multicenter study, we implemented this model to test its ability to predict survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) treated with chemotherapy.Methods: Pre- and post-contrast T<sub>1</sub>-weighted, FLAIR and ADC images were used to generate radio-pathomic maps for 51 patients with longitudinal pre- and post-treatment scans. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to test the influence of contrast-enhancing tumor volume, total cellularity, mean Cyt and mean ECF at baseline, immediately post-treatment and the pre- and post-treatment rate of change in volume and cellularity on overall survival (OS).Results: Smaller Cyt and larger ECF after treatment were significant predictors of OS, independent of tumor volume and other clinical prognostic factors (HR = 3.23 × 10-6, p &lt; 0.001 and HR = 2.39 × 105, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Both post-treatment volumetric growth rate and the rate of change in cellularity were significantly correlated with OS (HR = 1.17, p = 0.003 and HR = 1.14, p = 0.01, respectively).Conclusion: Changes in histological characteristics estimated from a radio-pathomic ML model are a promising tool for evaluating treatment response and predicting outcome in rGBM."

We aimed to evaluate the performance of EAVM to detect fibrosis by integration with whole heart histology and to identify the fibrosis pattern in NICM patients with ventricular tachycardias (VTs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight patients with NICM and VT underwent EAVM prior to death or heart transplantation. EAVM data was projected onto slices of the entire heart. Pattern, architecture, and amount of fibrosis were assessed in transmural biopsies corresponding to EAVM sites. Fibrosis pattern in NICM biopsies (n = 507) was highly variable and not limited to mid-wall/sub-epicardium. Fibrosis architecture was rarely compact, but typically patchy and/or diffuse. In NICM, biopsies without abnormal fibrosis unipolar voltage (UV) and bipolar voltage (BV) showed a linear association with wall thickness (WT). The amount of viable myocardium showed a linear association with both UV and BV. Accordingly, any cut-off to delineate fibrosis performed poorly. An equation was generated calculating the amount of fibrosis at any location, given WT and UV or BV.
CONCLUSION: Considering the linear relationships between WT, amount of fibrosis and both UV and BV, the search for any distinct voltage cut-off to identify fibrosis in NICM is futile. The amount of fibrosis can be calculated, if WT and voltages are known. Fibrosis pattern and architecture are different from ischaemic cardiomyopathy and findings on ischaemic substrates may not be applicable to NICM."

METHODS: A total of 108 patients with adequate imaging data and confirmed recurrent GBM were included in this retrospective study from a phase II multicenter trial of cabozantinib monotherapy (XL184-201) at either 100 mg (N = 87) or 140 mg (N = 21) per day. Contrast enhanced T1-weighted digital subtraction maps were used to define volume of contrast-enhancing tumor at baseline and subsequent follow-up time points. Volumetric radiographic response (>65% reduction in contrast-enhancing tumor volume from pretreatment baseline tumor volume sustained for more than 4 wk) was tested as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Volumetric response rate for all therapeutic doses was 38.9% (41.4% and 28.6% for 100 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively). A log-linear association between baseline tumor volume and OS (P = 0.0006) and a linear correlation between initial change in tumor volume and OS (P = 0.0256) were observed. A significant difference in OS was observed between responders (median OS = 20.6 mo) and nonresponders (median OS = 8.0 mo) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.3050, P < 0.0001). Multivariable analyses showed that continuous measures of baseline tumor volume (HR = 1.0233, P < 0.0001) and volumetric response (HR = 0.2240, P < 0.0001) were independent predictors of OS.
CONCLUSIONS: T1 subtraction maps provide value in determining response in recurrent GBM treated with cabozantinib and correlated with survival benefit."

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the ability of CTA and IVUS to differentiate between early and advanced coronary lesions in vivo, OCT serving as standard of reference.
METHODS: Multimodality imaging was prospectively performed in 30 NSTEMI patients. Plaque characteristics were assessed in 1083 cross-sections of 30 culprit lesions, co-registered among modalities. Absence of plaque, fibrous and fibrocalcific plaque on OCT were defined as early plaque, whereas lipid rich-plaque on OCT was defined as advanced plaque. Odds ratios adjusted for clustering were calculated to assess associations between plaque types on CTA and IVUS with early or advanced plaque.
RESULTS: Normal findings on CTA as well as on IVUS were associated with early plaque. Non-calcified, calcified plaques and the napkin ring sign on CTA were associated with advanced plaque. On IVUS, fatty and calcified plaques were associated with advanced plaque.
CONCLUSIONS: In vivo coronary plaque characteristics on CTA and IVUS are associated with plaque characteristics on OCT. Of note, normal findings on CTA and IVUS relate to early lesions on OCT. Nevertheless, multiple plaque features on CTA and IVUS are related to advanced plaques on OCT, which may make it difficult to use qualitative plaque assessment in clinical practice."

Major advances in diagnostics, technology and treatment have already revolutionized how we manage DR in the early part of the 21st century. For example, the accessibility of imaging with optical coherence tomography, and the development of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment are just some of the landmark developments that have shaped the DR landscape over the last few decades. Yet, there are still more exciting advances being made. Looking forward to 2030, many of these ongoing developments are likely to further transform the field. First, epidemiologic projections show that the global burden of DR is not only increasing, but also shifting from high-income countries towards middle- and low-income areas. Second, better understanding of disease pathophysiology is placing greater emphasis on retinal neural dysfunction and non-vascular aspects of diabetic retinal disease. Third, a wealth of information is becoming available from newer imaging modalities such as widefield imaging systems and optical coherence tomography angiography. Fourth, artificial intelligence for screening, diagnosis and prognostication of DR will become increasingly accessible and important. Fifth, new pharmacologic agents targeting other non-VEGF-driven pathways, and novel therapeutic strategies such as gene therapy are being developed for DR. Finally, the classification system for diabetic retinal disease will need to be continually updated to keep pace with new developments. In this article, we discuss these major trends in DR that we expect to see in 2030 and beyond."

Skin cancer is caused by un-repaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in skin cells, which generate genetic defects or mutations on the skin. Skin cancer tends to gradually spread over other body parts, so it is more curable in initial stages, which is why it is best detected at early stages. The increasing rate of skin cancer cases, high mortality rate, and expensive medical treatment require that its symptoms be diagnosed early. Considering the seriousness of these issues, researchers have developed various early detection techniques for skin cancer. Lesion parameters such as symmetry, color, size, shape, etc. are used to detect skin cancer and to distinguish benign skin cancer from melanoma. This paper presents a detailed systematic review of deep learning techniques for the early detection of skin cancer. Research papers published in well-reputed journals, relevant to the topic of skin cancer diagnosis, were analyzed. Research findings are presented in tools, graphs, tables, techniques, and frameworks for better understanding."

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a unique opportunity to improve the full spectrum of HCC clinical care, by improving HCC risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognostication. AI approaches include computational search algorithms, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. ML consists of a computer running repeated iterations of models, in order to progressively improve performance of a specific task, such as classifying an outcome. DL models are a subtype of ML, based on neural network structures that are inspired by the neuroanatomy of the human brain. A growing body of recent data now apply DL models to diverse data sources - including electronic health record data, imaging modalities, histopathology and molecular biomarkers - to improve the accuracy of HCC risk prediction, detection and prediction of treatment response. Despite the promise of these early results, future research is still needed to standardise AI data, and to improve both the generalisability and interpretability of results. If such challenges can be overcome, AI has the potential to profoundly change the way in which care is provided to patients with or at risk of HCC."

OBJECTIVES: To compare the performances of DeepSurv, a deep learning survival neural network with a tumor, node, and metastasis staging system in the prediction of survival and test the reliability of individual treatment recommendations provided by the deep learning survival neural network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this population-based cohort study, a deep learning-based algorithm was developed and validated using consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stages I to IV NSCLC between January 2010 and December 2015 in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. A total of 127 features, including patient characteristics, tumor stage, and treatment strategies, were assessed for analysis. The algorithm was externally validated on an independent test cohort, comprising 1182 patients with stage I to III NSCLC diagnosed between January 2009 and December 2013 in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. Analysis began January 2018 and ended June 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The deep learning survival neural network model was compared with the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system for lung cancer-specific survival. The C statistic was used to assess the performance of models. A user-friendly interface was provided to facilitate the survival predictions and treatment recommendations of the deep learning survival neural network model.
RESULTS: Of 17 322 patients with NSCLC included in the study, 13 361 (77.1%) were white and the median (interquartile range) age was 68 (61-74) years. The majority of tumors were stage I disease (10 273 [59.3%]) and adenocarcinoma (11 985 [69.2%]). The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 24 (10-43) months. There were 3119 patients who had lung cancer-related death during the follow-up period. The deep learning survival neural network model showed more promising results in the prediction of lung cancer-specific survival than the tumor, node, and metastasis stage on the test data set (C statistic = 0.739 vs 0.706). The population who received the recommended treatments had superior survival rates than those who received treatments not recommended (hazard ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.49-3.59; P < .001), which was verified by propensity score-matched groups. The deep learning survival neural network model visualization was realized by a user-friendly graphic interface.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The deep learning survival neural network model shows potential benefits in prognostic evaluation and treatment recommendation with respect to lung cancer-specific survival. This novel analytical approach may provide reliable individual survival information and treatment recommendations."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the accuracy and underlying evidence for DL for cephalometric landmark detection on 2-D and 3-D radiographs.
METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy studies published in 2015-2020 in Medline/Embase/IEEE/arXiv and employing DL for cephalometric landmark detection were identified and extracted by two independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis, subgroup, and meta-regression were performed, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. The review was registered (PROSPERO no. 227498).
DATA: From 321 identified records, 19 studies (published 2017-2020), all employing convolutional neural networks, mainly on 2-D lateral radiographs (n=15), using data from publicly available datasets (n=12) and testing the detection of a mean of 30 (SD: 25; range.: 7-93) landmarks, were included. The reference test was established by two experts (n=11), 1 expert (n=4), 3 experts (n=3), and a set of annotators (n=1). Risk of bias was high, and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly regarding the data selection and reference test conduct. Landmark prediction error centered around a 2-mm error threshold (mean; 95% confidence interval: (-0.581; 95 CI: -1.264 to 0.102 mm)). The proportion of landmarks detected within this 2-mm threshold was 0.799 (0.770 to 0.824).
CONCLUSIONS: DL shows relatively high accuracy for detecting landmarks on cephalometric imagery. The overall body of evidence is consistent but suffers from high risk of bias. Demonstrating robustness and generalizability of DL for landmark detection is needed.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Existing DL models show consistent and largely high accuracy for automated detection of cephalometric landmarks. The majority of studies so far focused on 2-D imagery; data on 3-D imagery are sparse, but promising. Future studies should focus on demonstrating generalizability, robustness, and clinical usefulness of DL for this objective."

The aim of the present study was to develop a biomarker of patient outcome after primary colorectal cancer resection by directly analysing scanned conventional haematoxylin and eosin stained sections using deep learning.
METHODS: More than 12 000 000 image tiles from patients with a distinctly good or poor disease outcome from four cohorts were used to train a total of ten convolutional neural networks, purpose-built for classifying supersized heterogeneous images. A prognostic biomarker integrating the ten networks was determined using patients with a non-distinct outcome. The marker was tested on 920 patients with slides prepared in the UK, and then independently validated according to a predefined protocol in 1122 patients treated with single-agent capecitabine using slides prepared in Norway. All cohorts included only patients with resectable tumours, and a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue block available for analysis. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival.
FINDINGS: 828 patients from four cohorts had a distinct outcome and were used as a training cohort to obtain clear ground truth. 1645 patients had a non-distinct outcome and were used for tuning. The biomarker provided a hazard ratio for poor versus good prognosis of 3·84 (95% CI 2·72-5·43; p<0·0001) in the primary analysis of the validation cohort, and 3·04 (2·07-4·47; p<0·0001) after adjusting for established prognostic markers significant in univariable analyses of the same cohort, which were pN stage, pT stage, lymphatic invasion, and venous vascular invasion.
INTERPRETATION: A clinically useful prognostic marker was developed using deep learning allied to digital scanning of conventional haematoxylin and eosin stained tumour tissue sections. The assay has been extensively evaluated in large, independent patient populations, correlates with and outperforms established molecular and morphological prognostic markers, and gives consistent results across tumour and nodal stage. The biomarker stratified stage II and III patients into sufficiently distinct prognostic groups that potentially could be used to guide selection of adjuvant treatment by avoiding therapy in very low risk groups and identifying patients who would benefit from more intensive treatment regimes.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a DLS in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, possible glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in community and clinic-based multiethnic populations with diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic performance of a DLS for diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases was evaluated using 494 661 retinal images. A DLS was trained for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125 189 images), and AMD (72 610 images), and performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71 896 images), and AMD (35 948 images). Training of the DLS was completed in May 2016, and validation of the DLS was completed in May 2017 for detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) using a primary validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes.
EXPOSURES: Use of a deep learning system.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS with professional graders (retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optometrists) as the reference standard.
RESULTS: In the primary validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896 images; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [2.2] years; 54.6% men), the prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy was 3.0%; vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, 0.6%; possible glaucoma, 0.1%; and AMD, 2.5%. The AUC of the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95% CI, 0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5% (95% CI, 87.3%-93.0%), and specificity was 91.6% (95% CI, 91.0%-92.2%). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 0.958 (95% CI, 0.956-0.961), sensitivity was 100% (95% CI, 94.1%-100.0%), and specificity was 91.1% (95% CI, 90.7%-91.4%). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.9%), and specificity was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.8%-87.5%). For AMD, AUC was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2% (95% CI, 91.1%-99.8%), and specificity was 88.7% (95% CI, 88.3%-89.0%). For referable diabetic retinopathy in the 10 additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889 to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the DLS in health care settings and the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes."

However, ∼50% of patients are classified as grade 2, an intermediate risk group with low clinical value. To improve risk stratification of NHG 2 breast cancer patients, we developed and validated a novel histological grade model (DeepGrade) based on digital whole-slide histopathology images (WSIs) and deep learning.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this observational retrospective study, routine WSIs stained with haematoxylin and eosin from 1567 patients were utilised for model optimisation and validation. Model generalisability was further evaluated in an external test set with 1262 patients. NHG 2 cases were stratified into two groups, DG2-high and DG2-low, and the prognostic value was assessed. The main outcome was recurrence-free survival.
RESULTS: DeepGrade provides independent prognostic information for stratification of NHG 2 cases in the internal test set, where DG2-high showed an increased risk for recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 2.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-6.97, P = 0.015) compared with the DG2-low group after adjusting for established risk factors (independent test data). DG2-low also shared phenotypic similarities with NHG 1, and DG2-high with NHG 3, suggesting that the model identifies morphological patterns in NHG 2 that are associated with more aggressive tumours. The prognostic value of DeepGrade was further assessed in the external test set, confirming an increased risk for recurrence in DG2-high (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11-3.29, P = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model-based stratification of patients with NHG 2 tumours is prognostic and adds clinically relevant information over routine histological grading. The methodology offers a cost-effective alternative to molecular profiling to extract information relevant for clinical decisions."

Purpose To develop a deep learning signature for N2 metastasis prediction and prognosis stratification in clinical stage I NSCLC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study conducted from May 2020 to October 2020 in a population with clinical stage I NSCLC, an internal cohort was adopted to establish a deep learning signature. Subsequently, the predictive efficacy and biologic basis of the proposed signature were investigated in an external cohort. A multicenter diagnostic trial (registration number: ChiCTR2000041310) was also performed to evaluate its clinical utility. Finally, on the basis of the N2 risk scores, the instructive significance of the signature in prognostic stratification was explored. The diagnostic efficiency was quantified with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the survival outcomes were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 3096 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 60 years ± 9; 1703 men) were included in the study. The proposed signature achieved AUCs of 0.82, 0.81, and 0.81 in an internal test set (n = 266), external test cohort (n = 133), and prospective test cohort (n = 300), respectively. In addition, higher deep learning scores were associated with a lower frequency of EGFR mutation (P = .04), higher rate of ALK fusion (P = .02), and more activation of pathways of tumor proliferation (P &lt; .001). Furthermore, in the internal test set and external cohort, higher deep learning scores were predictive of poorer overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 6.9; P = .02) and recurrence-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI: 1.4, 7.4; P = .007). Conclusion The deep learning signature could accurately predict N2 disease and stratify prognosis in clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We developed a deep-learning AI model (ThyNet) to differentiate between malignant tumours and benign thyroid nodules and aimed to investigate how ThyNet could help radiologists improve diagnostic performance and avoid unnecessary fine needle aspiration.
METHODS: ThyNet was developed and trained on 18 049 images of 8339 patients (training set) from two hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China) and tested on 4305 images of 2775 patients (total test set) from seven hospitals (the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China; the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the Guangzhou Army General Hospital, Guangzhou, China; the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; and the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China) in three stages. All nodules in the training and total test set were pathologically confirmed. The diagnostic performance of ThyNet was first compared with 12 radiologists (test set A); a ThyNet-assisted strategy, in which ThyNet assisted diagnoses made by radiologists, was developed to improve diagnostic performance of radiologists using images (test set B); the ThyNet assisted strategy was then tested in a real-world clinical setting (using images and videos; test set C). In a simulated scenario, the number of unnecessary fine needle aspirations avoided by ThyNet-assisted strategy was calculated.
FINDINGS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for accurate diagnosis of ThyNet (0·922 [95% CI 0·910-0·934]) was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (0·839 [0·834-0·844]; p<0·0001). Furthermore, ThyNet-assisted strategy improved the pooled AUROC of the radiologists from 0·837 (0·832-0·842) when diagnosing without ThyNet to 0·875 (0·871-0·880; p<0·0001) with ThyNet for reviewing images, and from 0·862 (0·851-0·872) to 0·873 (0·863-0·883; p<0·0001) in the clinical test, which used images and videos. In the simulated scenario, the number of fine needle aspirations decreased from 61·9% to 35·2% using the ThyNet-assisted strategy, while missed malignancy decreased from 18·9% to 17·0%.
INTERPRETATION: The ThyNet-assisted strategy can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of radiologists and help reduce unnecessary fine needle aspirations for thyroid nodules.

Prominent AI technologies such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have immensely influenced diagnostics, patient monitoring, novel pharmaceutical discoveries, drug development, and telemedicine. Significant innovations and improvements in disease identification and early intervention have been made using AI-generated algorithms for clinical decision support systems and disease prediction models. AI has remarkably impacted clinical drug trials by amplifying research into drug efficacy, adverse events, and candidate molecular design. AI's precision and analysis regarding patients' genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors have led to individualized treatment strategies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI-assisted telemedicine set a precedent for remote healthcare delivery and patient follow-up. Moreover, AI-generated applications and wearable devices have allowed ambulatory monitoring of vital signs. However, apart from being immensely transformative, AI's contribution to healthcare is subject to ethical and regulatory concerns. AI-backed data protection and algorithm transparency should be strictly adherent to ethical principles. Vigorous governance frameworks should be in place before incorporating AI in mental health interventions through AI-operated chatbots, medical education enhancements, and virtual reality-based training. The role of AI in medical decision-making has certain limitations, necessitating the importance of hands-on experience. Therefore, reaching an optimal balance between AI's capabilities and ethical considerations to ensure impartial and neutral performance in healthcare applications is crucial. This narrative review focuses on AI's impact on healthcare and the importance of ethical and balanced incorporation to make use of its full potential."

APPROACH AND RESULTS: In this study, we used two deep-learning algorithms based on whole-slide digitized histological slides (whole-slide imaging; WSI) to build models for predicting survival of patients with HCC treated by surgical resection. Two independent series were investigated: a discovery set (Henri Mondor Hospital, n = 194) used to develop our algorithms and an independent validation set (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA], n = 328). WSIs were first divided into small squares (""tiles""), and features were extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network (preprocessing step). The first deep-learning-based algorithm (""SCHMOWDER"") uses an attention mechanism on tumoral areas annotated by a pathologist whereas the second (""CHOWDER"") does not require human expertise. In the discovery set, c-indices for survival prediction of SCHMOWDER and CHOWDER reached 0.78 and 0.75, respectively. Both models outperformed a composite score incorporating all baseline variables associated with survival. Prognostic value of the models was further validated in the TCGA data set, and, as observed in the discovery series, both models had a higher discriminatory power than a score combining all baseline variables associated with survival. Pathological review showed that the tumoral areas most predictive of poor survival were characterized by vascular spaces, the macrotrabecular architectural pattern, and a lack of immune infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that artificial intelligence can help refine the prediction of HCC prognosis. It highlights the importance of pathologist/machine interactions for the construction of deep-learning algorithms that benefit from expert knowledge and allow a biological understanding of their output."

Standard artificial intelligence methods for histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for each diagnostic task1,2. Although such methods have achieved some success, they often have limited generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations3. Here, to address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation (CHIEF) model, a general-purpose weakly supervised machine learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for systematic cancer evaluation. CHIEF leverages two complementary pretraining methods to extract diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern recognition. We developed CHIEF using 60,530 whole-slide images spanning 19 anatomical sites. Through pretraining on 44 terabytes of high-resolution pathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted microscopic representations useful for cancer cell detection, tumour origin identification, molecular profile characterization and prognostic prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF using 19,491 whole-slide images from 32 independent slide sets collected from 24 hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1%, showing its ability to address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed by different slide preparation methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable foundation for efficient digital pathology evaluation for patients with cancer."

These images contain quantitative information, which is not routinely used to objectively extract prognostic biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated whether deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract prognosticators directly from these widely available images.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We hand-delineated single-tissue regions in 86 CRC tissue slides, yielding more than 100,000 HE image patches, and used these to train a CNN by transfer learning, reaching a nine-class accuracy of >94% in an independent data set of 7,180 images from 25 CRC patients. With this tool, we performed automated tissue decomposition of representative multitissue HE images from 862 HE slides in 500 stage I-IV CRC patients in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, a large international multicenter collection of CRC tissue. Based on the output neuron activations in the CNN, we calculated a ""deep stroma score,"" which was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model (hazard ratio [HR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99 [1.27-3.12], p = 0.0028), while in the same cohort, manual quantification of stromal areas and a gene expression signature of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were only prognostic in specific tumor stages. We validated these findings in an independent cohort of 409 stage I-IV CRC patients from the ""Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verhütung durch Screening"" (DACHS) study who were recruited between 2003 and 2007 in multiple institutions in Germany. Again, the score was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 1.63 [1.14-2.33], p = 0.008), CRC-specific OS (HR 2.29 [1.5-3.48], p = 0.0004), and relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 1.92 [1.34-2.76], p = 0.0004). A prospective validation is required before this biomarker can be implemented in clinical workflows.
CONCLUSIONS: In our retrospective study, we show that a CNN can assess the human tumor microenvironment and predict prognosis directly from histopathological images."

Deep learning systems allow for real-time computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps with high accuracy. We performed a multicenter, randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a CADe system in detection of colorectal neoplasias during real-time colonoscopy.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 685 subjects (61.32 ± 10.2 years old; 337 men) undergoing screening colonoscopies for CRC, post-polypectomy surveillance, or workup due to positive results from a fecal immunochemical test or signs or symptoms of CRC, at 3 centers in Italy from September through November 2019. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups who underwent high-definition colonoscopies with the CADe system or without (controls). The CADe system included an artificial intelligence-based medical device (GI-Genius, Medtronic) trained to process colonoscopy images and superimpose them, in real time, on the endoscopy display a green box over suspected lesions. A minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes was required. Lesions were collected and histopathology findings were used as the reference standard. The primary outcome was adenoma detection rate (ADR, the percentage of patients with at least 1 histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma). Secondary outcomes were adenomas detected per colonoscopy, non-neoplastic resection rate, and withdrawal time.
RESULTS: The ADR was significantly higher in the CADe group (54.8%) than in the control group (40.4%) (relative risk [RR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.45). Adenomas detected per colonoscopy were significantly higher in the CADe group (mean, 1.07 ±1.54) than in the control group (mean 0.71 ± 1.20) (incidence rate ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.15-1.86). Adenomas 5 mm or smaller were detected in a significantly higher proportion of subjects in the CADe group (33.7%) than in the control group (26.5%; RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.52), as were adenomas of 6 to 9 mm (detected in 10.6% of subjects in the CADe group vs 5.8% in the control group; RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.09-2.86), regardless of morphology or location. There was no significant difference between groups in withdrawal time (417 ± 101 seconds for the CADe group vs 435 ± 149 for controls; P = .1) or proportion of subjects with resection of non-neoplastic lesions (26.0% in the CADe group vs 28.7% of controls; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.12).
CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter, randomized trial, we found that including CADe in real-time colonoscopy significantly increases ADR and adenomas detected per colonoscopy without increasing withdrawal time. ClinicalTrials.gov no: 04079478."

According to NCCN guidelines, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of biopsies is the only clinically approved companion biomarker to trigger the use of ICI therapy. Based on prior work showing a relationship between quantitative imaging and gene expression, we hypothesize that quantitative imaging (radiomics) can provide an alternative surrogate for PD-L1 expression status in clinical decision support.
METHODS: 18F-FDG-PET/CT images and clinical data were curated from 697 patients with NSCLC from three institutions and these were analyzed using a small-residual-convolutional-network (SResCNN) to develop a deeply learned score (DLS) to predict the PD-L1 expression status. This developed model was further used to predict DCB, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in two retrospective and one prospective test cohorts of ICI-treated patients with advanced stage NSCLC.
RESULTS: The PD-L1 DLS significantly discriminated between PD-L1 positive and negative patients (area under receiver operating characteristics curve ≥0.82 in the training, validation, and two external test cohorts). Importantly, the DLS was indistinguishable from IHC-derived PD-L1 status in predicting PFS and OS, suggesting the utility of DLS as a surrogate for IHC. A score generated by combining the DLS with clinical characteristics was able to accurately (C-indexes of 0.70-0.87) predict DCB, PFS, and OS in retrospective training, prospective testing and external validation cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Hence, we propose DLS as a surrogate or substitute for IHC-determined PD-L1 measurement to guide individual pretherapy decisions pending in larger prospective trials."

We sought to identify Electronic Health Record (EHR) features of severe asthma and COPD exacerbations and evaluate the performance of four machine learning (ML) and one deep learning (DL) model in predicting readmissions using EHR data.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Observational study between September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2017, of patients hospitalized with asthma and COPD exacerbations.
RESULTS: This study included 5,794 patients, 1,893 with asthma and 3,901 with COPD. Patients with asthma were predominantly female (n = 1288 [68%]), 35% were Black (n = 669), and 25% (n = 479) were Hispanic. Black (44 vs. 33%, p = 0.01) and Hispanic patients (30 vs. 24%, p = 0.02) were more likely to be readmitted for asthma. Similarly, patients with COPD readmissions included a large percentage of Blacks (18 vs. 10%, p < 0.01) and Hispanics (8 vs. 5%, p < 0.01). To identify patients at high risk of readmission index hospitalization data of a subset of 2,682 patients, 777 with asthma and 1,905 with COPD, was analyzed with four ML models, and one DL model. We found that multilayer perceptron, the DL method, had the best sensitivity and specificity compared to the four ML methods implemented in the same dataset.
INTERPRETATION: Multilayer perceptron, a deep learning method, had the best performance in predicting asthma and COPD readmissions, demonstrating that EHR and deep learning integration can improve high-risk patient detection."

Since the first case was identified in Wuhan, China, the battle against this deadly disease started and has disrupted almost every field of life. Medical staff and laboratories are leading from the front, but researchers from various fields and governmental agencies have also proposed healthy ideas to protect each other. In this article, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented to highlight the latest developments in analyzing the COVID-19 data using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The number of studies related to Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and mathematical models discussed in this research has shown a significant impact on forecasting and the spread of COVID-19. The results and discussion presented in this study are based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Out of 218 articles selected at the first stage, 57 met the criteria and were included in the review process. The findings are therefore associated with those 57 studies, which recorded that CNN (DL) and SVM (ML) are the most used algorithms for forecasting, classification, and automatic detection. The importance of the compartmental models discussed is that the models are useful for measuring the epidemiological features of COVID-19. Current findings suggest that it will take around 1.7 to 140 days for the epidemic to double in size based on the selected studies. The 12 estimates for the basic reproduction range from 0 to 7.1. The main purpose of this research is to illustrate the use of ML, DL, and mathematical models that can be helpful for the researchers to generate valuable solutions for higher authorities and the healthcare industry to reduce the impact of this epidemic."

OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to establish effective models to predict early GDM.
METHODS: Pregnancy data for 73 variables during the first trimester were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Based on a machine learning (ML)-driven feature selection method, 17 variables were selected for early GDM prediction. To facilitate clinical application, 7 variables were selected from the 17-variable panel. Advanced ML approaches were then employed using the 7-variable data set and the 73-variable data set to build models predicting early GDM for different situations, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 16 819 and 14 992 cases were included in the training and testing sets, respectively. Using 73 variables, the deep neural network model achieved high discriminative power, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.80. The 7-variable logistic regression (LR) model also achieved effective discriminate power (AUC = 0.77). Low body mass index (BMI) (≤ 17) was related to an increased risk of GDM, compared to a BMI in the range of 17 to 18 (minimum risk interval) (11.8% vs 8.7%, P = .09). Total 3,3,5'-triiodothyronine (T3) and total thyroxin (T4) were superior to free T3 and free T4 in predicting GDM. Lipoprotein(a) was demonstrated a promising predictive value (AUC = 0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: We employed ML models that achieved high accuracy in predicting GDM in early pregnancy. A clinically cost-effective 7-variable LR model was simultaneously developed. The relationship of GDM with thyroxine and BMI was investigated in the Chinese population."

Deep learning (DL) may improve ternary classification. Purpose To determine whether a strategy that includes an adjudication approach can enhance the performance of DL ternary classification models in predicting the invasiveness of adenocarcinoma at chest CT and maintain performance in classifying pGGNs. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, six ternary models for classifying preinvasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinoma were developed using a multicenter data set of lung nodules. The DL-based models were progressively modified through framework optimization, joint learning, and an adjudication strategy (simulating a multireader approach to resolving discordant nodule classifications), integrating two binary classification models with a ternary classification model to resolve discordant classifications sequentially. The six ternary models were then tested on an external data set of pGGNs imaged between December 2019 and January 2021. Diagnostic performance including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity was assessed. The χ2 test was used to compare model performance in different subgroups stratified by clinical confounders. Results A total of 4929 nodules from 4483 patients (mean age, 50.1 years ± 9.5 [SD]; 2806 female) were divided into training (n = 3384), validation (n = 579), and internal (n = 966) test sets. A total of 361 pGGNs from 281 patients (mean age, 55.2 years ± 11.1 [SD]; 186 female) formed the external test set. The proposed strategy improved DL model performance in external testing (P &lt; .001). For classifying minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, the accuracy was 85% and 79%, sensitivity was 75% and 63%, and specificity was 89% and 85% for the model with adjudication (model 6) and the model without (model 3), respectively. Model 6 showed a relatively narrow range (maximum minus minimum) across diagnostic indexes (accuracy, 1.7%; sensitivity, 7.3%; specificity, 0.9%) compared with the other models (accuracy, 0.6%-10.8%; sensitivity, 14%-39.1%; specificity, 5.5%-17.9%). Conclusion Combining framework optimization, joint learning, and an adjudication approach improved DL classification of adenocarcinoma invasiveness at chest CT. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Histopathological tissue slides of colorectal cancer specimens contain rich prognostically relevant information. However, existing studies do not have multicentre external validation with real-world sample processing protocols, and algorithms are not yet widely used in clinical routine.
METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre study, we collected tissue samples from four groups of patients with resected colorectal cancer from Australia, Germany, and the USA. We developed and externally validated a deep learning-based prognostic-stratification system for automatic prediction of overall and cancer-specific survival in patients with resected colorectal cancer. We used the model-predicted risk scores to stratify patients into different risk groups and compared survival outcomes between these groups. Additionally, we evaluated the prognostic value of these risk groups after adjusting for established prognostic variables.
FINDINGS: We trained and validated our model on a total of 4428 patients. We found that patients could be divided into high-risk and low-risk groups on the basis of the deep learning-based risk score. On the internal test set, the group with a high-risk score had a worse prognosis than the group with a low-risk score, as reflected by a hazard ratio (HR) of 4·50 (95% CI 3·33-6·09) for overall survival and 8·35 (5·06-13·78) for disease-specific survival (DSS). We found consistent performance across three large external test sets. In a test set of 1395 patients, the high-risk group had a lower DSS than the low-risk group, with an HR of 3·08 (2·44-3·89). In two additional test sets, the HRs for DSS were 2·23 (1·23-4·04) and 3·07 (1·78-5·3). We showed that the prognostic value of the deep learning-based risk score is independent of established clinical risk factors.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that attention-based self-supervised deep learning can robustly offer a prognosis on clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer, generalising across different populations and serving as a potentially new prognostic tool in clinical decision making for colorectal cancer management. We release all source codes and trained models under an open-source licence, allowing other researchers to reuse and build upon our work.

These studies rely on comprehensive sleep-related data which often contains complex multi-dimensional physiological and molecular measurements across multiple timepoints. Thus, sleep research is well-suited for the application of computational approaches that can handle high-dimensional data. Here, we survey recent advances in machine and deep learning together with the availability of large human cohort studies with sleep data that can jointly drive the next breakthroughs in the sleep-research field. We describe sleep-related data types and datasets, and present some of the tasks in the field that can be targets for algorithmic approaches, as well as the challenges and opportunities in pursuing them."

In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed.

It is used widely to analyze ""big data"". In gastrointestinal surgery, surgeons deal with various data such as clinical parameters, surgical videos, and pathological images, to stratify surgical risk, perform safe surgery and predict patient prognosis. In the current ""big data"" era, the accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data drives studies using ML algorithms. Three subfields of ML are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, we summarize applications of ML to surgical practice in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care. Prediction and stratification using ML is promising; however, the current overarching concern is the availability of ML models. Information systems that can manage ""big data"" and integrate ML models into electronic health records are essential to incorporate ML into daily practice. ML is fundamental technology to meaningfully process data that exceeds the capacity of the human mind to comprehend. The accelerating accumulation of a large amount of data is changing the nature of surgical practice fundamentally.

Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only.

Lung cancer accurate diagnosis is based on distinct histological patterns combined with molecular data for personalized treatment. Precise lung cancer classification from a single H&E slide can be challenging for a pathologist, requiring most of the time additional histochemical and special immunohistochemical stains for the final pathology report. According to WHO, small biopsy and cytology specimens are the available materials for about 70% of lung cancer patients with advanced-stage unresectable disease. Thus, the limited available diagnostic material necessitates its optimal management and processing for the completion of diagnosis and predictive testing according to the published guidelines. During the new era of Digital Pathology, Deep Learning offers the potential for lung cancer interpretation to assist pathologists' routine practice. Herein, we systematically review the current Artificial Intelligence-based approaches using histological and cytological images of lung cancer.

METHODS: The data used to train and validate the algorithm consists of 59,985 patients with 87 features extracted at the end of surgery. Feed-forward networks with a logistic output were trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. The deep neural networks were trained on 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for testing. The authors assessed improvement of the deep neural network by adding American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification and robustness of the deep neural network to a reduced feature set. The networks were then compared to ASA Physical Status, logistic regression, and other published clinical scores including the Surgical Apgar, Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality, Risk Quantification Index, and the Risk Stratification Index.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality in the training and test sets were 0.81% and 0.73%. The deep neural network with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status classification had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.93). The highest logistic regression area under the curve was found with a reduced feature set and ASA Physical Status (0.90, 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.93). The Risk Stratification Index had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, at 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99).

Regardless of the status of its current contribution, the field of predictive analytics is expected to fundamentally change the way we diagnose and treat diseases, as well as the conduct of biomedical science research. In this review, we describe the main tools and techniques in predictive analytics and will analyze the trends in application of these techniques over the recent years. We will also provide examples of its application in medicine and more specifically in stroke and neurovascular research and outline current limitations."

By providing practical examples of how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied successfully in orthopaedic surgery, particularly in the realm of imaging data sets and the integration of clinical data, this study aims to provide orthopaedic surgeons with the necessary tools to not only evaluate existing literature but also to consider AI's potential in their own clinical or research pursuits. We first review standard deep neural networks which can analyze numerical clinical variables, then describe convolutional neural networks which can analyze image data, and then introduce multimodal AI models which analyze various types of different data. Then, we contrast these deep learning techniques with related but more limited techniques such as radiomics, describe how to interpret deep learning studies, and how to initiate such studies at your institution. Ultimately, by empowering orthopaedic surgeons with the knowledge and know-how of deep learning, this review aspires to facilitate the translation of research into clinical practice, thereby enhancing the efficacy and precision of real-world orthopaedic care for patients."

Different data modalities provide complementary information that can be leveraged to gain a more complete understanding of each subject. In the biomedical domain, multi-omics data includes molecular (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, etc.) and imaging (radiomics, pathomics) modalities which, when combined, have the potential to improve performance on prediction, classification, clustering and other tasks. Deep learning encompasses a wide variety of methods, each of which have certain strengths and weaknesses for multi-omics integration.
METHOD: In this review, we categorize recent deep learning-based approaches by their basic architectures and discuss their unique capabilities in relation to one another. We also discuss some emerging themes advancing the field of multi-omics integration.
RESULTS: Deep learning-based multi-omics integration methods were categorized broadly into non-generative (feedforward neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks, and autoencoders) and generative (variational methods, generative adversarial models, and a generative pretrained model). Generative methods have the advantage of being able to impose constraints on the shared representations to enforce certain properties or incorporate prior knowledge. They can also be used to generate or impute missing modalities. Recent advances achieved by these methods include the ability to handle incomplete data as well as going beyond the traditional molecular omics data types to integrate other modalities such as imaging data.
CONCLUSION: We expect to see further growth in methods that can handle missingness, as this is a common challenge in working with complex and heterogeneous data. Additionally, methods that integrate more data types are expected to improve performance on downstream tasks by capturing a comprehensive view of each sample."

Correlating histomorphometric features with clinical parameters through machine learning approaches can provide valuable information about natural population variance. To this end, we leveraged deep learning, computational image analysis, and feature analysis to investigate the relationship of histomorphometry with patient age, sex, and serum creatinine (SCr) in a multinational set of reference kidney tissue sections.
METHODS: A panoptic segmentation neural network was developed and used to segment viable and sclerotic glomeruli, cortical and medullary interstitia, tubules, and arteries/arterioles in the digitized images of 79 periodic acid-Schiff-stained human nephrectomy sections showing minimal pathologic changes. Simple morphometrics (e.g., area, radius, density) were quantified from the segmented classes. Regression analysis aided in determining the relationship of histomorphometric parameters with age, sex, and SCr.
RESULTS: Our deep-learning model achieved high segmentation performance for all test compartments. The size and density of nephrons and arteries/arterioles varied significantly among healthy humans, with potentially large differences between geographically diverse patients. Nephron size was significantly dependent on SCr. Slight, albeit significant, differences in renal vasculature were observed between sexes. Glomerulosclerosis percentage increased, and cortical density of arteries/arterioles decreased, as a function of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Using deep learning, we automated precise measurements of kidney histomorphometric features. In the reference kidney tissue, several histomorphometric features demonstrated significant correlation to patient demographics and SCr. Deep learning tools can increase the efficiency and rigor of histomorphometric analysis."

We conducted this study to analyze the current evidence of DL in thyroid nodule imaging diagnosis in both internal and external test sets.
METHODS: Until the end of December 2022, PubMed, IEEE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched. We included primary epidemiological studies using externally validated DL techniques in image-based thyroid nodule appraisal. This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022362892).
RESULTS: We evaluated evidence from 17 primary epidemiological studies using externally validated DL techniques in image-based thyroid nodule appraisal. Fourteen studies were deemed eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of these DL algorithms were 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.90), 0.84 (0.82-0.86), and 0.93 (0.91-0.95), respectively. For the internal validation set, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.91 (0.89-0.93), 0.88 (0.85-0.91), and 0.96 (0.93-0.97), respectively. In the external validation set, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.87 (0.85-0.89), 0.81 (0.77-0.83), and 0.91 (0.88-0.93), respectively. Notably, in subgroup analyses, DL algorithms still demonstrated exceptional diagnostic validity.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests DL-based imaging shows diagnostic performances comparable to clinicians for differentiating thyroid nodules in both the internal and external test sets."

Epub 2023 Mar 9.,Yang Y,Eur Radiol,2023,2023/03/09,,,10.1007/s00330-023-09515-1,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning system (DLS) by using an auxiliary section that extracts and outputs specific ultrasound diagnostic features to improve the explainable, clinical relevant utility of using DLS for detecting NAFLD.
METHODS: In a community-based study of 4144 participants with abdominal ultrasound scan in Hangzhou, China, we sampled 928 (617 [66.5%] females, mean age: 56 years ± 13 [standard deviation]) participants (2 images per participant) to develop and validate DLS, a two-section neural network (2S-NNet). Radiologists' consensus diagnosis classified hepatic steatosis as none steatosis, mild, moderate, and severe. We also explored the NAFLD detection performance of six one-section neural network models and five fatty liver indices on our data set. We further evaluated the influence of participants' characteristics on the correctness of 2S-NNet by logistic regression.
RESULTS: Area under the curve (AUROC) of 2S-NNet for hepatic steatosis was 0.90 for ≥ mild, 0.85 for ≥ moderate, and 0.93 for severe steatosis, and was 0.90 for NAFLD presence, 0.84 for moderate to severe NAFLD, and 0.93 for severe NAFLD. The AUROC of NAFLD severity was 0.88 for 2S-NNet, and 0.79-0.86 for one-section models. The AUROC of NAFLD presence was 0.90 for 2S-NNet, and 0.54-0.82 for fatty liver indices. Age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, fibrosis-4 index, android fat ratio, and skeletal muscle via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry had no significant impact on the correctness of 2S-NNet (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: By using two-section design, 2S-NNet had improved the performance for detecting NAFLD with more explainable, clinical relevant utility than using one-section design.
KEY POINTS: • Based on the consensus review derived from radiologists, our DLS (2S-NNet) had an AUROC of 0.88 by using two-section design and yielded better performance for detecting NAFLD than using one-section design with more explainable, clinical relevant utility. • The 2S-NNet outperformed five fatty liver indices with the highest AUROCs (0.84-0.93 vs. 0.54-0.82) for different NAFLD severity screening, indicating screening utility of deep learning-based radiology may perform better than blood biomarker panels in epidemiology. • The correctness of 2S-NNet was not significantly influenced by individual's characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, fibrosis-4 index, android fat ratio, and skeletal muscle via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry."

Such opportunities are particularly relevant for the management of older patients, a group that is characterised by complex multimorbidity patterns and significant interindividual variability in homeostatic capacity, organ function, and response to treatment. Clinical tools that utilise machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal choice of treatment are slowly gaining the necessary approval from governing bodies and being implemented into healthcare, with significant implications for virtually all medical disciplines during the next phase of digital medicine. Beyond obtaining regulatory approval, a crucial element in implementing these tools is the trust and support of the people that use them. In this context, an increased understanding by clinicians of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms provides an appreciation of the possible benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and improves the chances for successful adoption. This review provides a broad taxonomy of machine learning algorithms, followed by a more detailed description of each algorithm class, their purpose and capabilities, and examples of their applications, particularly in geriatric medicine.

Tissue characterization and risk stratification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are a challenging problem. Risk stratification of RA patients using traditional risk factor-based calculators either underestimates or overestimates the CV risk. Advancements in medical imaging have facilitated early and accurate CV risk stratification compared to conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.
RECENT FINDING: In recent years, a link between carotid atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis has been widely discussed by multiple studies. Imaging the carotid artery using 2-D ultrasound is a noninvasive, economic, and efficient imaging approach that provides an atherosclerotic plaque tissue-specific image. Such images can help to morphologically characterize the plaque type and accurately measure vital phenotypes such as media wall thickness and wall variability. Intelligence-based paradigms such as machine learning- and deep learning-based techniques not only automate the risk characterization process but also provide an accurate CV risk stratification for better management of RA patients. This review provides a brief understanding of the pathogenesis of RA and its association with carotid atherosclerosis imaged using the B-mode ultrasound technique. Lacunas in traditional risk scores and the role of machine learning-based tissue characterization algorithms are discussed and could facilitate cardiovascular risk assessment in RA patients. The key takeaway points from this review are the following: (i) inflammation is a common link between RA and atherosclerotic plaque buildup, (ii) carotid ultrasound is a better choice to characterize the atherosclerotic plaque tissues in RA patients, and (iii) intelligence-based paradigms are useful for accurate tissue characterization and risk stratification of RA patients."

To determine how well carotid plaque features predict the likelihood of CAD and cardiovascular (CV) events using deep learning (DL) and compare against the machine learning (ML) paradigm. The participants in this study consisted of 459 individuals who had undergone coronary angiography, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, and focused carotid B-mode ultrasound. Each patient was tracked for thirty days. The measurements on these patients consisted of maximum plaque height (MPH), total plaque area (TPA), carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), and intraplaque neovascularization (IPN). CAD risk and CV event stratification were performed by applying eight types of DL-based models. Univariate and multivariate analysis was also conducted to predict the most significant risk predictors. The DL's model effectiveness was evaluated by the area-under-the-curve measurement while the CV event prediction was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model (CPHM) and compared against the DL-based concordance index (c-index). IPN showed a substantial ability to predict CV events (p < 0.0001). The best DL system improved by 21% (0.929 vs. 0.762) over the best ML system. DL-based CV event prediction showed a ~ 17% increase in DL-based c-index compared to the CPHM (0.86 vs. 0.73). CAD and CV incidents were linked to IPN and carotid imaging characteristics. For survival analysis and CAD prediction, the DL-based system performs superior to ML-based models."

Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods applied in the existing models during the development phase.

Our model achieved significantly better prognosis prediction than the conventional Cox Proportional Hazard model and other competitive deep learning approaches in various settings. Moreover, an interpretation approach was applied to tackle the ""black-box"" nature of deep neural networks and we identified features (i.e., genes, miRNA, demographic/clinical variables) that made important contributions to distinguishing predicted high- and low-risk patients.

An avenue, to account for a part of this ""missingness"" is to evaluate gene-gene interactions (epistasis) thereby elucidating their effect on complex diseases. This can potentially help with identifying gene functions, pathways, and drug targets. However, the exhaustive evaluation of all possible genetic interactions among millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) raises several issues, otherwise known as the ""curse of dimensionality"". The dimensionality involved in the epistatic analysis of such exponentially growing SNPs diminishes the usefulness of traditional, parametric statistical methods. With the immense popularity of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), a non-parametric method, proposed in 2001, that classifies multi-dimensional genotypes into one- dimensional binary approaches, led to the emergence of a fast-growing collection of methods that were based on the MDR approach. Moreover, machine-learning (ML) methods such as random forests and neural networks (NNs), deep-learning (DL) approaches, and hybrid approaches have also been applied profusely, in the recent years, to tackle this dimensionality issue associated with whole genome gene-gene interaction studies. However, exhaustive searching in MDR based approaches or variable selection in ML methods, still pose the risk of missing out on relevant SNPs. Furthermore, interpretability issues are a major hindrance for DL methods. To minimize this loss of information, Python based tools such as PySpark can potentially take advantage of distributed computing resources in the cloud, to bring back smaller subsets of data for further local analysis. Parallel computing can be a powerful resource that stands to fight this ""curse"". PySpark supports all standard Python libraries and C extensions thus making it convenient to write codes to deliver dramatic improvements in processing speed for extraordinarily large sets of data."

METHODS: PubMed search of 2020 literature on public health and epidemiology informatics was conducted and all retrieved references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 15 candidate best papers were selected among the 920 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by the two section editors, two chief editors, and external reviewers, including at least two senior faculty, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook to make an informed decision regarding the selection of the best papers.
RESULTS: Among the 920 references retrieved from PubMed, four were suggested as best papers and the first three were finally selected. The fourth paper was excluded because of reproducibility issues. The first best paper is a very public health focused paper with health informatics and biostatistics methods applied to stratify patients within a cohort in order to identify those at risk of suicide; the second paper describes the use of a randomized design to test the likely impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-management elements, on patient consultations or antibiotic requests for influenza-like illnesses. The third selected paper evaluates the perception among communities of routine use of Whole Genome Sequencing and Big Data technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the three studies suggest that using Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics methods could leverage, when combined with Deep Learning, early interventions and appropriate treatments to mitigate suicide risk. Further, they also demonstrate that well informing and empowering patients could help them to be involved more in their care process."

Thus, preventive, and early CVD risk identification in a non-invasive manner is vital as healthcare cost is increasing day by day. Conventional methods for risk prediction of CVD lack robustness due to the non-linear relationship between risk factors and cardiovascular events in multi-ethnic cohorts. Few recently proposed machine learning-based risk stratification reviews without deep learning (DL) integration. The proposed study focuses on CVD risk stratification by the use of techniques mainly solo deep learning (SDL) and hybrid deep learning (HDL). Using a PRISMA model, 286 DL-based CVD studies were selected and analyzed. The databases included were Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review is focused on different SDL and HDL architectures, their characteristics, applications, scientific and clinical validation, along with plaque tissue characterization for CVD/stroke risk stratification. Since signal processing methods are also crucial, the study further briefly presented Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based solutions. Finally, the study presented the risk due to bias in AI systems. The risk of bias tools used were (I) ranking method (RBS), (II) region-based map (RBM), (III) radial bias area (RBA), (IV) prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST), and (V) risk of bias in non-randomized studies-of interventions (ROBINS-I).

Ground truth (GT) selection is vital for reducing the risk of bias (RoB) for CVD risk stratification. It was observed that the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms were widely used since the feature extraction process was automated. The ensemble-based DL techniques for risk stratification in CVD are likely to supersede the SDL and HDL paradigms. Due to the reliability, high accuracy, and faster execution on dedicated hardware, these DL methods for CVD risk assessment are powerful and promising. The risk of bias in DL methods can be best reduced by considering multicentre data collection and clinical evaluation."

Implantable and wearable cardiac devices have enabled the detection of asymptomatic AF episodes-termed subclinical AF (SCAF). SCAF, the prevalence of which is likely significantly underestimated, is associated with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and a significant stroke risk. Recent advances in machine learning, namely artificial intelligence-enabled ECG (AI-ECG), have enabled identification of patients at higher likelihood of SCAF. Leveraging the capabilities of AI-ECG algorithms to drive screening protocols could eventually allow for earlier detection and treatment and help reduce the burden associated with AF."

OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a practical review and tutorial on scalable causal structure learning models with examples of real-world data to help health care audiences understand and apply them.
METHODS: We reviewed traditional (combinatorial and score-based) methods for causal structure discovery and machine learning-based schemes. Various traditional approaches have been studied to tackle this problem, the most important among these being the Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour algorithms. This was followed by analyzing the literature on score-based methods, which are computationally faster. Owing to the continuous constraint on acyclicity, there are new deep learning approaches to the problem in addition to traditional and score-based methods. Such methods can also offer scalability, particularly when there is a large amount of data involving multiple variables. Using our own evaluation metrics and experiments on linear, nonlinear, and benchmark Sachs data, we aimed to highlight the various advantages and disadvantages associated with these methods for the health care community. We also highlighted recent developments in biomedicine where causal structure learning can be applied to discover structures such as gene networks, brain connectivity networks, and those in cancer epidemiology.
RESULTS: We also compared the performance of traditional and machine learning-based algorithms for causal discovery over some benchmark data sets. Directed Acyclic Graph-Graph Neural Network has the lowest structural hamming distance (19) and false positive rate (0.13) based on the Sachs data set, whereas Greedy Equivalence Search and Max-Min Hill Climbing have the best false discovery rate (0.68) and true positive rate (0.56), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based approaches, including deep learning, have many advantages over traditional approaches, such as scalability, including a greater number of variables, and potentially being applied in a wide range of biomedical applications, such as genetics, if sufficient data are available. Furthermore, these models are more flexible than traditional models and are poised to positively affect many applications in the future."

Greater caregiver burdens and financial impacts on the healthcare system are expected as we wait for an effective treatment for dementia. Researchers are constantly exploring new therapies and screening approaches for the early detection of dementia. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied in dementia research, including machine learning and deep learning methods for dementia diagnosis and progression detection. Computerized apps are also convenient tools for patients and caregivers to monitor cognitive function changes. Furthermore, social robots can potentially provide daily life support or guidance for the elderly who live alone. This review aims to provide an overview of AI applications in dementia research. We divided the applications into three categories according to different stages of cognitive impairment: (1) cognitive screening and training, (2) diagnosis and prognosis for dementia, and (3) dementia care and interventions. There are numerous studies on AI applications for dementia research. However, one challenge that remains is comparing the effectiveness of different AI methods in real clinical settings."

These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
RESULTS: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
CONCLUSIONS: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future."

As one of the applications of machine learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to computed tomography (CT) imaging data improves the accuracy of diagnosis, but the results could be more consistent.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CNN in assisting in detecting pulmonary nodules in CT images.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Elsevier, CNKI and Wanfang databases were systematically retrieved before 30 April 2023. Two reviewers searched and checked the full text of articles that might meet the criteria. The reference criteria are joint diagnoses by experienced physicians. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated by a random-effects model. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in this meta-analysis, involving 2,391,702 regions of interest, comprising segmented images with a few wide pixels. The combined sensitivity and specificity values of the CNN model in detecting pulmonary nodules were 0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 291. The AUC was 0.98. There was heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity among the studies. The results suggested that data sources, pretreatment methods, reconstruction slice thickness, population source and locality might contribute to the heterogeneity of these eligible studies.
CONCLUSION: The CNN model can be a valuable diagnostic tool with high accuracy in detecting pulmonary nodules."

METHODS: This ambispective, multicenter study assessed the performance of a DL-based model for MS lesion segmentation and compared it to alternative DL- and non-DL-based methods. Models were tested on internal (n = 20) and external (n = 18) datasets from Latin America, and on an external dataset from Europe (n = 49). We also examined robustness by rescanning six patients (n = 6) from our MS clinical cohort. Moreover, we studied inter-human annotator agreement and discussed our findings in light of these results. Performance and robustness were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Dice coefficient (DC), and coefficient of variation (CV).
RESULTS: Inter-human ICC ranged from 0.89 to 0.95, while spatial agreement among annotators showed a median DC of 0.63. Using expert manual segmentations as ground truth, our DL model achieved a median DC of 0.73 on the internal, 0.66 on the external, and 0.70 on the challenge datasets. The performance of our DL model exceeded that of the alternative algorithms on all datasets. In the robustness experiment, our DL model also achieved higher DC (ranging from 0.82 to 0.90) and lower CV (ranging from 0.7 to 7.9%) when compared to the alternative methods.
CONCLUSION: Our DL-based model outperformed alternative methods for brain MS lesion segmentation. The model also proved to generalize well on unseen data and has a robust performance and low processing times both on real-world and challenge-based data.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Our DL-based model demonstrated superior performance in accurately segmenting brain MS lesions compared to alternative methods, indicating its potential for clinical application with improved accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.
KEY POINTS: • Automated lesion load quantification in MS patients is valuable; however, more accurate methods are still necessary. • A novel deep learning model outperformed alternative MS lesion segmentation methods on multisite datasets. • Deep learning models are particularly suitable for MS lesion segmentation in clinical scenarios."

RECENT FINDINGS: Artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, is showing promise in diagnosing axSpA assisting with X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and MRI analyses, with some models matching or outperforming radiologists in detecting sacroiliitis and markers. Moreover, it is increasingly being used in predictive modelling of disease progression and personalized treatment, and could aid risk assessment, treatment response and clinical subtype identification. Variable study designs, sample sizes and the predominance of retrospective, single-centre studies still limit the generalizability of results.
SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence technologies have significant potential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of axSpA, providing more accurate, efficient and personalized healthcare solutions. However, their integration into clinical practice requires rigorous validation, ethical and legal considerations, and comprehensive training for healthcare professionals. Future advances in artificial intelligence could complement clinical expertise and improve patient care through improved diagnostic accuracy and tailored therapeutic strategies, but the challenge remains to ensure that these technologies are validated in prospective multicentre trials and ethically integrated into patient care."

Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms for early breast and cervical cancer identification. Four subgroups are also investigated: cancer type (breast or cervical), validation type (internal or external), imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound, cytology, or colposcopy), and DL algorithms versus clinicians. Thirty-five studies are deemed eligible for systematic review, 20 of which are meta-analyzed, with a pooled sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 85-90%), specificity of 84% (79-87%), and AUC of 0.92 (0.90-0.94). Acceptable diagnostic performance with analogous DL algorithms was highlighted across all subgroups. Therefore, DL algorithms could be useful for detecting breast and cervical cancer using medical imaging, having equivalent performance to human clinicians. However, this tentative assertion is based on studies with relatively poor designs and reporting, which likely caused bias and overestimated algorithm performance. Evidence-based, standardized guidelines around study methods and reporting are required to improve the quality of DL research."

Deep learning analysis of electrocardiography (ECG) may be useful in detecting aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), and mitral regurgitation (MR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop ECG deep learning algorithms to identify moderate or severe AS, AR, and MR alone and in combination.
METHODS: A total of 77,163 patients undergoing ECG within 1 year before echocardiography from 2005-2021 were identified and split into train (n = 43,165), validation (n = 12,950), and test sets (n = 21,048; 7.8% with any of AS, AR, or MR). Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AU-ROC) and precision-recall curves. Outside validation was conducted on an independent data set. Test accuracy was modeled using different disease prevalence levels to simulate screening efficacy using the deep learning model.
RESULTS: The deep learning algorithm model accuracy was as follows: AS (AU-ROC: 0.88), AR (AU-ROC: 0.77), MR (AU-ROC: 0.83), and any of AS, AR, or MR (AU-ROC: 0.84; sensitivity 78%, specificity 73%) with similar accuracy in external validation. In screening program modeling, test characteristics were dependent on underlying prevalence and selected sensitivity levels. At a prevalence of 7.8%, the positive and negative predictive values were 20% and 97.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning analysis of the ECG can accurately detect AS, AR, and MR in this multicenter cohort and may serve as the basis for the development of a valvular heart disease screening program."

Machine learning methods take several forms and individual models can be of many different types. More than 50 models have been approved for use in routine healthcare, and the numbers continue to grow exponentially. The reliability and robustness of any model depends on multiple factors, including the quality and quantity of the data used to develop the models, and the selection of features in the data considered most important to maximising accuracy. In ensuring models are safe, effective and reproducible in routine care, physicians need to have some understanding of how these models are developed and evaluated, and to collaborate with data and computer scientists in their design and validation.

Studies were excluded if the ECG was acquired by ambulatory, stress, intracardiac, or implantable devices, and if the pathology of interest was arrhythmic in nature. After duplicate reviewers screened search results, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. Three articles used DL to detect LV systolic dysfunction, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89-0.93 and an accuracy of 98%. One study used DL to detect LV hypertrophy, achieving an AUC of 0.87 and an accuracy of 87%.

Machine learning approaches open new possibilities for studying SLE, a multifactorial, highly heterogeneous and complex disease. Here, we discuss how machine learning methods are rapidly being integrated into the field of SLE research. Recent reports have focused on building prediction models and/or identifying novel biomarkers using both supervised and unsupervised techniques for understanding disease pathogenesis, early diagnosis and prognosis of disease. In this review, we will provide an overview of machine learning techniques to discuss current gaps, challenges and opportunities for SLE studies. External validation of most prediction models is still needed before clinical adoption. Utilisation of deep learning models, access to alternative sources of health data and increased awareness of the ethics, governance and regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence in medicine will help propel this exciting field forward."

We developed a multitask deep learning model to predict MVI and RFS using preoperative MRI scans.
METHODS: Utilising a retrospective dataset of 725 HCC patients from seven institutions, we developed and validated a multitask deep learning model focused on predicting MVI and RFS. The model employs a transformer architecture to extract critical features from preoperative MRI scans. It was trained on a set of 234 patients and internally validated on a set of 58 patients. External validation was performed using three independent sets (n = 212, 111, 110).
RESULTS: The multitask deep learning model yielded high MVI prediction accuracy, with AUC values of 0.918 for the training set and 0.800 for the internal test set. In external test sets, AUC values were 0.837, 0.815 and 0.800. Radiologists' sensitivity and inter-rater agreement for MVI prediction improved significantly when integrated with the model. For RFS, the model achieved C-index values of 0.763 in the training set and ranged between 0.628 and 0.728 in external test sets. Notably, PA-TACE improved RFS only in patients predicted to have high MVI risk and low survival scores (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning model allows accurate MVI and survival prediction in HCC patients. Prospective studies are warranted to assess the clinical utility of this model in guiding personalised treatment in conjunction with clinical criteria."

Apart from its distinct epidemiology, the natural behavior, treatment, and prognosis are different from other head and neck cancers. With the growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL), in head and neck cancer care, we sought to explore the unique clinical application and implementation direction of AI in the management of NPC.
METHODS: The search protocol was performed to collect publications using AI, machine learning (ML) and DL in NPC management from PubMed, Scopus and Embase. The articles were filtered using inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the quality of the papers was assessed. Data were extracted from the finalized articles.
RESULTS: A total of 78 articles were reviewed after removing duplicates and papers that did not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After quality assessment, 60 papers were included in the current study. There were four main types of applications, which were auto-contouring, diagnosis, prognosis, and miscellaneous applications (especially on radiotherapy planning). The different forms of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) accounted for the majority of DL algorithms used, while the artificial neural network (ANN) was the most frequent ML model implemented.
CONCLUSION: There is an overall positive impact identified from AI implementation in the management of NPC. With improving AI algorithms, we envisage AI will be available as a routine application in a clinical setting soon."

RECENT FINDINGS: Machine-learning (ML) techniques have recently been applied to substance use disorder (SUD) data for multiple predictive applications including detecting current abuse, assessing future risk and predicting treatment success. These models cover a wide range of machine-learning techniques and data types including physiological measures, longitudinal surveys, treatment outcomes, national surveys, medical records and social media.
SUMMARY: The application of machine-learning models to substance use disorder data shows significant promise, with some use cases and data types showing high predictive accuracy, particularly for models of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting current substance use, portending potential clinical diagnostic applications; however, these results are uneven, with some models performing poorly or at chance, a limitation likely reflecting insufficient data and/or weak validation methods. The field will likely benefit from larger and more multimodal datasets, greater standardization of data recording and rigorous testing protocols as well as greater use of modern deep neural network models applied to multimodal unstructured datasets."

OBJECTIVE: The present study conducted a scoping review of the use of artificial intelligence based on machine learning to understand how it is used for pharmacovigilance tasks, characterize differences with other fields, and identify opportunities to improve pharmacovigilance through the use of machine learning.
DESIGN: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched to identify articles pertaining to the use of machine learning in pharmacovigilance published from the year 2000 to September 2021. After manual screening of 7744 abstracts, a total of 393 papers met the inclusion criteria for further analysis. Extraction of key data on study design, data sources, sample size, and machine learning methodology was performed. Studies with the characteristics of good machine learning practice were defined and manual review focused on identifying studies that fulfilled these criteria and results that showed promise.
RESULTS: The majority of studies (53%) were focused on detecting safety signals using traditional statistical methods. Of the studies that used more recent machine learning methods, 61% used off-the-shelf techniques with minor modifications. Temporal analysis revealed that newer methods such as deep learning have shown increased use in recent years. We found only 42 studies (10%) that reflect current best practices and trends in machine learning.

However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called tiSFM (totally interpretable sequence to function model). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multi-layer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multi-layer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs.
RESULTS: We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM's model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.

Every year, millions of people are infected with this virus. There is no vaccine available for this disease. Dengue virus is present in four serologically varying strains, DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4, and each of these serotypes is further classified into various genotypes based on the geographic distribution and genetic variance. Mosquitoes play the role of vectors for this disease. Tropical countries and some temperate parts of the world witness outbreaks of dengue mainly during the monsoon (rainy) seasons. Several algorithms have been developed to predict the occurrence and prognosis of dengue disease. These algorithms are mainly based on epidemiological data, climate factors, and online search patterns in the infected area. Most of these algorithms are based on either machine learning or deep learning techniques. We summarize the different software tools available for predicting the outbreaks of dengue based on the aforementioned factors, briefly outline the methodology used in these algorithms, and provide a comprehensive list of programs available for the same in this article."

Traditional statistical methods rely on the strong assumptions of distribution. Statistical methods such as testing and differential expression are commonly used in omics analysis. Deep learning, on the other hand, is an advanced computer science technique that is powerful in mining high-dimensional omics data for prediction tasks. Recently, integrative frameworks or methods have been developed for omics studies that combine statistical models and deep learning algorithms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The aim of these integrative frameworks is to combine the strengths of both statistical methods and deep learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy while also providing interpretability and explainability. This review report discusses the current state-of-the-art integrative frameworks, their limitations, and potential future directions in survival and time-to-event longitudinal analysis, dimension reduction and clustering, regression and classification, feature selection, and causal and transfer learning."

Distinguishing low- from high-quality data can be challenging, often requiring expert knowledge and considerable manual intervention. Data Valuation algorithms are a class of methods that seek to quantify the value of each sample in a dataset based on its contribution or importance to a given predictive task. These data values have shown an impressive ability to identify mislabeled observations, and filtering low-value data can boost machine learning performance. In this work, we present a simple alternative to existing methods, termed Data Valuation with Gradient Similarity (DVGS). This approach can be easily applied to any gradient descent learning algorithm, scales well to large datasets, and performs comparably or better than baseline valuation methods for tasks such as corrupted label discovery and noise quantification. We evaluate the DVGS method on tabular, image and RNA expression datasets to show the effectiveness of the method across domains. Our approach has the ability to rapidly and accurately identify low-quality data, which can reduce the need for expert knowledge and manual intervention in data cleaning tasks."

OBJECTIVE: To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19.
METHODS: We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19-related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient numbers."

36096039,Imaging to predict checkpoint inhibitor outcomes in cancer. A systematic review,"Ter Maat LS, van Duin IAJ, Elias SG, van Diest PJ, Pluim JPW, Verhoeff JJC, de Jong PA, Leiner T, Veta M, Suijkerbuijk KPM.",Eur J Cancer. 2022 Nov;175:60-76. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2022.07.034. Epub 2022 Sep 9.,Ter Maat LS,Eur J Cancer,2022,2022/09/12,,,10.1016/j.ejca.2022.07.034,"BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibition has radically improved the perspective for patients with metastatic cancer, but predicting who will not respond with high certainty remains difficult. Imaging-derived biomarkers may be able to provide additional insights into the heterogeneity in tumour response between patients. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and qualitatively assess the current evidence on imaging biomarkers that predict response and survival in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors in all cancer types.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched from database inception to 29th November 2021. Articles eligible for inclusion described baseline imaging predictive factors, radiomics and/or imaging machine learning models for predicting response and survival in patients with any kind of malignancy treated with checkpoint inhibitors. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS and PROBAST tools and data was extracted.
RESULTS: In total, 119 studies including 15,580 patients were selected. Of these studies, 73 investigated simple imaging factors. 45 studies investigated radiomic features or deep learning models. Predictors of worse survival were (i) higher tumour burden, (ii) presence of liver metastases, (iii) less subcutaneous adipose tissue, (iv) less dense muscle and (v) presence of symptomatic brain metastases. Hazard rate ratios did not exceed 2.00 for any predictor in the larger and higher quality studies. The added value of baseline fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography parameters in predicting response to treatment was limited. Pilot studies of radioactive drug tracer imaging showed promising results. Reports on radiomics were almost unanimously positive, but numerous methodological concerns exist.
CONCLUSIONS: There is well-supported evidence for several imaging biomarkers that can be used in clinical decision making. Further research, however, is needed into biomarkers that can more accurately identify which patients who will not benefit from checkpoint inhibition. Radiomics and radioactive drug labelling appear to be promising approaches for this purpose."

For areas with limited testing capacity, wastewater surveillance can provide information on the disease dynamic at a community level. A predictive model is a key to generating quantitative estimates of the infected population. Modeling longitudinal wastewater data can be challenging as biomarkers in wastewater are susceptible to variations caused by multiple factors associated with the wastewater matrix and the sewersheds characteristics. As WBE is an emerging trend, the model should be able to address the uncertainties of wastewater from different sewersheds. We proposed exploiting machine learning and deep learning techniques, which are supported by the growing WBE data. In this article, we reviewed the existing predictive models, among which the emerging machine learning/deep learning models showed great potential. However, most models are built for individual sewersheds with few features extracted from the wastewater. To fulfill the research gap, we compared different time-series and non-time-series models for their short-term predictive performance of COVID-19 cases in 9 diverse sewersheds. The time-series models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and Prophet, outcompeted the non-time-series models. Besides viral (SARS-CoV-2) loads and location identity, domain-specific features like biochemical parameters of wastewater, geographical parameters of the sewersheds, and some socioeconomic parameters of the communities can contribute to the models. With proper feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, we believe machine learning models like LSTM can be a feasible solution for the COVID-19 trend prediction via WBE. Overall, this is a proof-of-concept study on the application of machine learning in COVID-19 WBE. Future studies are needed to deploy and maintain the model in more real-world applications."

OBJECTIVE: We aim to track the temporal and spatial distribution of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence expressed on Twitter during the entire pandemic period in major English-speaking countries.
METHODS: We collected 5,257,385 English-language tweets regarding COVID-19 vaccination between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, in 6 countries-the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Ireland. Transformer-based deep learning models were developed to classify each tweet as intent to accept or reject COVID-19 vaccination and the belief that COVID-19 vaccine is effective or unsafe. Sociodemographic factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence in the United States were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable linear regressions.
RESULTS: The 6 countries experienced similar evolving trends of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence. On average, the prevalence of intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination decreased from 71.38% of 44,944 tweets in March 2020 to 34.85% of 48,167 tweets in June 2022 with fluctuations. The prevalence of believing COVID-19 vaccines to be unsafe continuously rose by 7.49 times from March 2020 (2.84% of 44,944 tweets) to June 2022 (21.27% of 48,167 tweets). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence varied by country, vaccine manufacturer, and states within a country. The democrat party and higher vaccine confidence were significantly associated with lower vaccine hesitancy across US states.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and confidence evolved and were influenced by the development of vaccines and viruses during the pandemic. Large-scale self-generated discourses on social media and deep learning models provide a cost-efficient approach to monitoring routine vaccine hesitancy."

Human analysis of images remains the primary method of diagnosis, but it can be inconsistent and inaccurate. Deep learning (DL) can potentially enhance image-based diagnosis by providing objective and accurate results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the recent advances of deep learning (DL) techniques for gynecological cancer diagnosis using various images and explore their future implications.
METHODS: The study followed the PRISMA-2 guidelines, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Five databases were searched for articles published from January 2018 to December 2022. Articles that focused on five types of gynecological cancer and used DL for diagnosis were selected. Two reviewers assessed the articles for eligibility and quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data was extracted from each study, and the performance of DL techniques for gynecological cancer classification was estimated by pooling and transforming sensitivity and specificity values using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: The review included 48 studies, and the meta-analysis included 24 studies. The studies used different images and models to diagnose different gynecological cancers. The most popular models were ResNet, VGGNet, and UNet. DL algorithms showed more sensitivity but less specificity compared to machine learning (ML) methods. The AUC of the summary receiver operating characteristic plot was higher for DL algorithms than for ML methods. Of the 48 studies included, 41 were at low risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the potential of DL in improving the screening and diagnosis of gynecological cancer, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, the high heterogeneity and quality of the studies could affect the validity of the results. Further research is necessary to validate the findings of this study and to explore the potential of DL in improving gynecological cancer diagnosis."

We aimed to establish prognostic models using a deep learning algorithm for survival prediction.
METHODS: We collected 11,168 PGIL patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to form the training and test cohorts. At the same time, we collected 82 PGIL patients from three medical centres to form the external validation cohort. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, random survival forest (RSF) model, and neural multitask logistic regression (DeepSurv) model to predict PGIL patients' overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS rates of PGIL patients in the SEER database were 77.1%, 69.4%, 63.7%, and 50.3%, respectively. The RSF model based on all variables showed that the top three most important variables for predicting OS were age, histological type, and chemotherapy. The independent risk factors for PGIL patient prognosis included sex, age, race, primary site, Ann Arbor stage, histological type, symptom, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, according to the Lasso regression analysis. Using these factors, we built the CoxPH and DeepSurv models. The DeepSurv model's C-index values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.742 in the test cohort, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort, which demonstrated that the DeepSurv model performed better compared to the RSF model (0.728) and the CoxPH model (0.724). The DeepSurv model accurately predicted 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS. Both calibration curves and decision curve analysis curves demonstrated the superior performance of the DeepSurv model. We developed the DeepSurv model as an online web calculator for survival prediction, which can be accessed at http://124.222.228.112:8501/ .
CONCLUSIONS: This DeepSurv model with external validation is superior to previous studies in predicting short-term and long-term survival and can help us make better-individualized decisions for PGIL patients."

Arboviruses are a significant NTD category spread by mosquitoes. Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika are three arboviruses that affect a large proportion of the population in Latin and South America. The clinical diagnosis of these arboviral diseases is a difficult task due to the concurrent circulation of several arboviruses which present similar symptoms, inaccurate serologic tests resulting from cross-reaction and co-infection with other arboviruses.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this paper is to present evidence on the state of the art of studies investigating the automatic classification of arboviral diseases to support clinical diagnosis based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models.
METHOD: We carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in which Google Scholar was searched to identify key papers on the topic. From an initial 963 records (956 from string-based search and seven from a single backward snowballing procedure), only 15 relevant papers were identified.
RESULTS: Results show that current research is focused on the binary classification of Dengue, primarily using tree-based ML algorithms. Only one paper was identified using DL. Five papers presented solutions for multi-class problems, covering Dengue (and its variants) and Chikungunya. No papers were identified that investigated models to differentiate between Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an efficient clinical decision support system for arboviral diseases can improve the quality of the entire clinical process, thus increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis and the associated treatment. It should help physicians in their decision-making process and, consequently, improve the use of resources and the patient's quality of life."

The aim of the article is to analyze the current use of AI in nutrients science research. The literature review was conducted in PubMed. A total of 399 records published between 1987 and 2020 were obtained, of which, after analyzing the titles and abstracts, 261 were rejected. In the next stages, the remaining records were analyzed using the full-text versions and, finally, 55 papers were selected. These papers were divided into three areas: AI in biomedical nutrients research (20 studies), AI in clinical nutrients research (22 studies) and AI in nutritional epidemiology (13 studies). It was found that the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was dominant in the group of research on food composition study and production of nutrients. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms were widely used in studies on the influence of nutrients on the functioning of the human body in health and disease and in studies on the gut microbiota. Deep learning (DL) algorithms prevailed in a group of research works on clinical nutrients intake. The development of dietary systems using AI technology may lead to the creation of a global network that will be able to both actively support and monitor the personalized supply of nutrients."

Pooled accuracy was 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86-0.90] for ML and 0.86 [95% CI: 0.78-0.91] for radiologists. Pooled AUC of ML was 0.94 [95% CI:0.92-0.96]and for radiologists, it was 0.90 [95% CI: 0.84-0.93].
CONCLUSIONS: MRI-based ML/DL techniques can complement radiologists to improve the accuracy of classifying GBMs from PCNSL, possibly reduce the need for a biopsy, and avoid any unwanted neurosurgical resection of a PCNSL."

Epub 2019 Jun 14.,Li X,Lab Invest,2019,2019/06/16,,,10.1038/s41374-019-0272-3,"Microvascularity is highly correlated with the grading and subtyping of gliomas, making this one of its most important histological features. Accurate quantitative analysis of microvessels is helpful for the development of a targeted therapy for antiangiogenesis. The deep-learning algorithm is by far the most effective segmentation and detection model and enables location and recognition of complex microvascular networks in large images obtained from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained specimens. We proposed an automated deep-learning-based method to detect and quantify the microvascularity in glioma and applied it to comprehensive clinical analyses. A total of 350 glioma patients were enrolled in our study, for which digitalized imaging of H&E stained slides were reviewed, molecular diagnosis was performed and follow-up was investigated. The microvascular features were compared according to their histologic types, molecular types, and patients' prognosis. The results show that the proposed method can quantify microvascular characteristics automatically and effectively. Significant increases of microvascular density and microvascular area were observed in glioblastomas (95% p < 0.001 in density, 170% p < 0.001 in area) in comparison with other histologic types; increases were also observed in cases with TERT-mut only (68% p < 0.001 in density, 54% p < 0.001 in area) compared with other molecular types. Survival analysis showed that microvascular features can be used to cluster cases into two groups with different survival periods (hazard ratio [HR] 2.843, log-rank <0.001), which indicates the quantified microvascular features may potentially be alternative signatures for revealing patients' prognosis. This deep-learning-based method may be a useful tool in routine clinical practice for precise diagnosis and antiangiogenic treatment."

Its prevalence has steadily increased, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors, and management strategies. While traditional prognostic markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria provide valuable insights, they may not fully capture the complexity of CKD progression and associated cardiovascular (CV) risks.This paper reviews the current state of renal and CV risk prediction in CKD, highlighting the limitations of traditional models and the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), offers a promising avenue for enhancing risk prediction by analyzing vast and diverse patient data, including genetic markers, biomarkers, and imaging. By identifying intricate patterns and relationships within datasets, AI algorithms can generate more comprehensive risk profiles, enabling personalized and nuanced risk assessments.Despite its potential, the integration of AI into clinical practice faces challenges such as the opacity of some algorithms and concerns regarding data quality, privacy, and bias. Efforts towards explainable AI (XAI) and rigorous data governance are essential to ensure transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness in AI-driven predictions."

Machine learning offers a novel approach to risk stratification for ICD assignment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, OpenGrey, MedrXiv, arXiv, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies modelling SCD risk prediction within days to years using machine learning were eligible for inclusion. Transparency and quality of reporting (TRIPOD) and risk of bias (PROBAST) were assessed. A total of 4356 studies were screened with 11 meeting the inclusion criteria with heterogeneous populations, methods, and outcome measures preventing meta-analysis. The study size ranged from 122 to 124 097 participants. Input data sources included demographic, clinical, electrocardiogram, electrophysiological, imaging, and genetic data ranging from 4 to 72 variables per model. The most common outcome metric reported was the area under the receiver operator characteristic (n = 7) ranging between 0.71 and 0.96. In six studies comparing machine learning models and regression, machine learning improved performance in five. No studies adhered to a reporting standard. Five of the papers were at high risk of bias.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning for SCD prediction has been under-applied and incorrectly implemented but is ripe for future investigation. It may have some incremental utility in predicting SCD over traditional models. The development of reporting standards for machine learning is required to improve the quality of evidence reporting in the field."

In this work, we focus on a fundamental problem that enables social media mining for disease monitoring. We present and make available SEED, a natural language processing approach to detect symptom and disease mentions from social media data obtained from platforms such as Twitter and DailyStrength and to normalize them into UMLS terminology. Using multi-corpus training and deep learning models, the tool achieves an overall F1 score of 0.86 and 0.72 on DailyStrength and balanced Twitter datasets, significantly improving over previous approaches on the same datasets. We apply the tool on Twitter posts that report COVID19 symptoms, particularly to quantify whether the SEED system can extract symptoms absent in the training data. The study results also draw attention to the potential of multi-corpus training for performance improvements and the need for continuous training on newly obtained data for consistent performance amidst the ever-changing nature of the social media vocabulary."

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does a deep learning (DL)-based classifier for usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) derived using CT scan features accurately discriminate radiologist-determined visual UIP?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed. Chest CT scans acquired in individuals with and without ILD were drawn from a variety of public and private data sources. Using radiologist-determined visual UIP as ground truth, a convolutional neural network was used to learn discrete CT scan features of UIP, with outputs used to predict the likelihood of UIP using a linear support vector machine. Test performance characteristics were assessed in an independent performance cohort and multicenter ILD clinical cohort. Transplant-free survival was compared between UIP classification approaches using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: A total of 2,907 chest CT scans were included in the training (n = 1,934), validation (n = 408), and performance (n = 565) data sets. The prevalence of radiologist-determined visual UIP was 12.4% and 37.1% in the performance and ILD clinical cohorts, respectively. The DL-based UIP classifier predicted visual UIP in the performance cohort with sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 86%, respectively, and in the multicenter ILD clinical cohort with 81% and 77%, respectively. DL-based and visual UIP classification similarly discriminated survival, and outcomes were consistent among cases with positive DL-based UIP classification irrespective of visual classification.
INTERPRETATION: A DL-based classifier for UIP demonstrated good test performance across a wide range of UIP prevalence and similarly discriminated survival when compared with radiologist-determined UIP. This automated tool could efficiently screen for UIP in patients undergoing chest CT scan and identify a high-risk phenotype among those with known ILD."

BACKGROUND: Small series describe short-stay discharge following elective EVAR. Our study aims to quantify characteristics associated with this decision.
METHODS: The VQI EVAR and NSQIP datasets were queried. Patients who underwent elective EVAR recorded in VQI, between 1/2010-5/2017 were split 2:1 into test and analytic cohorts via random number assignment. Cross-reference with the Medicare claims database confirmed all-cause mortality data. Bootstrap sampling was employed in model. Deep learning algorithms independently evaluated each dataset as a sensitivity test.
RESULTS: Univariate outcomes, including 30-day survival, were statistically worse in the DD group when compared to the SD group (all P < 0.05). A prediction score, SD-EVAR, derived from the VQI EVAR dataset including pre- and intra-op variables that discriminate between SD and DD was externally validated in NSQIP (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.79, P < 0.001); deep learning analysis concurred. This score suggests 66% of EVAR patients may be appropriate for short-stay discharge. A free smart phone app calculating short-stay discharge potential is available through QxMD Calculate https://qxcalc.app.link/vqidis.
CONCLUSIONS: Selecting patients for short-stay discharge after EVAR is possible without increasing harm. The majority of infrarenal AAA patients treated with EVAR in the United States fit a risk profile consistent with short-stay discharge, representing a significant cost-savings potential to the healthcare system."

DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic test or technology.
SUBJECTS AND CONTROLS: We included 5245 patients with wide-angle retinal imaging from the neonatal intensive care units of 7 institutions as part of the Imaging and Informatics in ROP study. Images were labeled with the clinical diagnoses of plus disease (plus, preplus, no plus), which were documented in the chart, and a reference standard diagnosis was determined by 3 image-based ROP graders and the clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: Demographics (birth weight, gestational age) and clinical diagnoses for all eye examinations were recorded from each institution. Using an FL approach, a DL model for plus disease classification was trained using only the clinical labels. The 3 class probabilities were then converted into a vascular severity score (VSS) for each eye examination, as well as an ""institutional VSS,"" in which the average of the VSS values assigned to patients' higher severity (""worse"") eyes at each examination was calculated for each institution.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared demographics, clinical diagnoses of plus disease, and institutional VSSs between institutions using the McNemar-Bowker test, 2-proportion Z test, and 1-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis by the Tukey-Kramer test. Single regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between demographics and VSSs.
RESULTS: We found that the proportion of patients diagnosed with preplus disease varied significantly between institutions (P &lt; 0.001). Using the DL-derived VSS trained on the data from all institutions using FL, we observed differences in the institutional VSS and the level of vascular severity diagnosed as no plus (P &lt; 0.001) across institutions. A significant, inverse relationship between the institutional VSS and mean gestational age was found (P = 0.049, adjusted R2 = 0.49).
CONCLUSIONS: A DL-derived ROP VSS developed without sharing data between institutions using FL identified differences in the clinical diagnoses of plus disease and overall levels of ROP severity between institutions. Federated learning may represent a method to standardize clinical diagnoses and provide objective measurements of disease for image-based diseases."

Deep learning, a model that finds patterns in large samples of data, outperform traditional statistical methods in making predictions. This study aimed to create a deep learning-based model (DLM) to predict postoperative complications in patients with cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
METHODS: This prospective multicenter study was conducted by the 28 institutions, and 478 patients were included in the analysis. Deep learning was used to create two predictive models of the overall postoperative complications and neurological complications, one of the major complications. These models were constructed by learning the patient's preoperative background, clinical symptoms, surgical procedures, and imaging findings. These logistic regression models were also created, and these accuracies were compared with those of the DLM.
RESULTS: Overall complications were observed in 127 cases (26.6%). The accuracy of the DLM was 74.6 ± 3.7% for predicting the overall occurrence of complications, which was comparable to that of the logistic regression (74.1%). Neurological complications were observed in 48 cases (10.0%), and the accuracy of the DLM was 91.7 ± 3.5%, which was higher than that of the logistic regression (90.1%).
CONCLUSION: A new algorithm using deep learning was able to predict complications after cervical OPLL surgery. This model was well calibrated, with prediction accuracy comparable to that of regression models. The accuracy remained high even for predicting only neurological complications, for which the case number is limited compared to conventional statistical methods."

This article provides a brief review spanning epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and risk factors associated with PE, mainly discussing the emerging role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) technology in predicting PE, to advance the understanding of PE and foster the clinical application of early prediction methods.
METHODS: Our narrative review comprehensively examines the PE epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, risk factors and predictive approaches, including traditional models and AI deep learning technology.
RESULTS: Preeclampsia involves a wide range of biological and biochemical risk factors, among which poor uterine artery remodeling, excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, and imbalanced angiogenesis play important roles. Traditional PE prediction models exhibit significant limitations in sensitivity and specificity, particularly in predicting late-onset PE, with detection rates ranging from only 30% to 50%. AI models have exhibited a notable level of predictive accuracy and value across various populations and datasets, achieving detection rates of approximately 70%. Particularly, they have shown superior predictive capabilities for late-onset PE, thereby presenting novel opportunities for early screening and management of the condition.
CONCLUSION: AI DL technology holds promise in revolutionizing the prediction and management of PE. AI-based approaches offer a pathway toward more effective risk assessment methods by addressing the shortcomings of traditional prediction models. Ongoing research efforts should focus on expanding databases and validating the performance of AI in diverse populations, leading to the development of more sophisticated prediction models with improved accuracy."

In this study, we aimed to develop a novel deep-learning-based biological ageing marker (referred to as RetiPhenoAge hereafter) using retinal images and PhenoAge, a composite biomarker of phenotypic age.
METHODS: We used retinal photographs from the UK Biobank dataset to train a deep-learning algorithm to predict the composite score of PhenoAge. We used a deep convolutional neural network architecture with multiple layers to develop our deep-learning-based biological ageing marker, as RetiPhenoAge, with the aim of identifying patterns and features in the retina associated with variations of blood biomarkers related to renal, immune, liver functions, inflammation, and energy metabolism, and chronological age. We determined the performance of this biological ageing marker for the prediction of morbidity (cardiovascular disease and cancer events) and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) in three independent cohorts (UK Biobank, the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases [SEED], and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study [AREDS] from the USA). We also compared the performance of RetiPhenoAge with two other known ageing biomarkers (hand grip strength and adjusted leukocyte telomere length) and one lifestyle factor (physical activity) for risk stratification of mortality and morbidity. We explored the underlying biology of RetiPhenoAge by assessing its associations with different systemic characteristics (eg, diabetes or hypertension) and blood metabolite levels. We also did a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with RetiPhenoAge, followed by expression quantitative trait loci mapping, a gene-based analysis, and a gene-set analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs for the associations between RetiPhenoAge and the different morbidity and mortality outcomes.
FINDINGS: Retinal photographs for 34 061 UK Biobank participants were used to train the model, and data for 9429 participants from the SEED cohort and for 3986 participants from the AREDS cohort were included in the study. RetiPhenoAge was associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1·92 [95% CI 1·42-2·61]), cardiovascular disease mortality (1·97 [1·02-3·82]), cancer mortality (2·07 [1·29-3·33]), and cardiovascular disease events (1·70 [1·17-2·47]), independent of PhenoAge and other possible confounders. Similar findings were found in the two independent cohorts (HR 1·67 [1·21-2·31] for cardiovascular disease mortality in SEED and 2·07 [1·10-3·92] in AREDS). RetiPhenoAge had stronger associations with mortality and morbidity than did hand grip strength, telomere length, and physical activity. We identified two genetic variants that were significantly associated with RetiPhenoAge (single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3791224 and rs8001273), and were linked to expression quantitative trait locis in various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and the brain.
INTERPRETATION: Our new deep-learning-derived biological ageing marker is a robust predictor of mortality and morbidity outcomes and could be used as a novel non-invasive method to measure ageing.

METHODS: This nonrandomized, single-arm, prospective, interventional study included patients attending DR screening at four centers across Thailand from September 2019 to January 2020, with mild or no DR. Fundus photographs were input into the model, and patients were scheduled for their subsequent screening from September 2020 to January 2021 in order of predicted risk. Evaluation focused on model sensitivity, defined as correctly ranking patients that developed MOD+ within the first 50% of subsequent screens.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,757 patients, of which 52 (3.0%) developed MOD+. Using the model-proposed order, the model's sensitivity was 90.4%. Both the model-proposed order and mild/no DR plus HbA1c had significantly higher sensitivity than the random order (P < 0.001). Excluding one major (rural) site that had practical implementation challenges, the remaining sites included 567 patients and 15 (2.6%) developed MOD+. Here, the model-proposed order achieved 86.7% versus 73.3% for the ranking that used DR grade and hemoglobin A1c.
CONCLUSIONS: The model can help prioritize follow-up visits for the largest subgroups of DR patients (those with no or mild DR). Further research is needed to evaluate the impact on clinical management and outcomes.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Deep learning demonstrated potential for risk stratification in DR screening. However, real-world practicalities must be resolved to fully realize the benefit."

Epub 2022 Aug 9.,Bressem KK,Radiology,2022,2022/08/09,,,10.1148/radiol.212526,"Background MRI is frequently used for early diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, evaluation is time-consuming and requires profound expertise because noninflammatory degenerative changes can mimic axSpA, and early signs may therefore be missed. Deep neural networks could function as assistance for axSpA detection. Purpose To create a deep neural network to detect MRI changes in sacroiliac joints indicative of axSpA. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included MRI examinations of five cohorts of patients with clinical suspicion of axSpA collected at university and community hospitals between January 2006 and September 2020. Data from four cohorts were used as the training set, and data from one cohort as the external test set. Each MRI examination in the training and test sets was scored by six and seven raters, respectively, for inflammatory changes (bone marrow edema, enthesitis) and structural changes (erosions, sclerosis). A deep learning tool to detect changes indicative of axSpA was developed. First, a neural network to homogenize the images, then a classification network were trained. Performance was evaluated with use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. P &lt; .05 was considered indicative of statistically significant difference. Results Overall, 593 patients (mean age, 37 years ± 11 [SD]; 302 women) were studied. Inflammatory and structural changes were found in 197 of 477 patients (41%) and 244 of 477 (51%), respectively, in the training set and 25 of 116 patients (22%) and 26 of 116 (22%) in the test set. The AUCs were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97) for all inflammatory changes, 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.95) for inflammatory changes fulfilling the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society definition, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.96) for structural changes indicative of axSpA. Sensitivity and specificity on the external test set were 22 of 25 patients (88%) and 65 of 91 patients (71%), respectively, for inflammatory changes and 22 of 26 patients (85%) and 70 of 90 patients (78%) for structural changes. Conclusion Deep neural networks can detect inflammatory or structural changes to the sacroiliac joint indicative of axial spondyloarthritis at MRI. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

Such models derive from huge databases (big data) including a large variety of health-related individual patient data (input) and the corresponding diagnosis and/or outcome (labels). Various types of algorithms (e.g. neural networks) based on powerful computational ability (machine), allow to detect the relationship between input and labels (learning). More complex algorithms, like recurrent neural network can learn from previous as well as actual input (deep learning) and are used for more complex tasks like imaging analysis and personalized (bespoke) medicine. The prompt availability of big data makes that artificial intelligence can provide rapid answers to questions that would require years of traditional clinical research. It may therefore be a key tool to overcome several major gaps in the model of advanced chronic liver disease, mostly transition from mild to clinically significant portal hypertension, the impact of acute decompensation and the role of further decompensation and treatment efficiency. However, several limitations of artificial intelligence should be overcome before its application in clinical practice. Assessment of the risk of bias, understandability of the black boxes developing the models and models' validation are the most important areas deserving clarification for artificial intelligence to be widely accepted from physicians and patients."

In addition, there are concerns about limited diagnostic workforces, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing a strain on pathology and radiology services. In this review, we discuss how artificial intelligence algorithms could assist clinicians in (1) screening asymptomatic patients at risk of cancer, (2) investigating and triaging symptomatic patients, and (3) more effectively diagnosing cancer recurrence. We provide an overview of the main artificial intelligence approaches, including historical models such as logistic regression, as well as deep learning and neural networks, and highlight their early diagnosis applications. Many data types are suitable for computational analysis, including electronic healthcare records, diagnostic images, pathology slides and peripheral blood, and we provide examples of how these data can be utilised to diagnose cancer. We also discuss the potential clinical implications for artificial intelligence algorithms, including an overview of models currently used in clinical practice.

Due to the long-wavelength, which reduces optical damage, suppresses autofluorescence, and obviates light scattering, NIR-IIb nanoprobes afford deep tissue penetration with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Hence, NIR-IIb imaging facilitates deep learning and decipherment of biological proceedings in living organisms with astounding high clarity. In comparison to its predecessors in the visible-near-infrared spectrum, imaging in the NIR-IIb has shown great potential for tissue imaging and extrapolating imaging applications for clinical studies. However, the use of organic fluorescent nanoprobes (OFNPs) in the NIR-IIb region is still rare since it is in its early stages. Thus, herein we aim to survey the recent development of different organic fluorescent nanomaterials with NIR-IIb characteristics, their unique photophysical properties, and their utilization in deep imaging in animal models. Further, practical researches on organic fluorescent nanoprobes with NIR-IIb emission and their transition to clinical applications are highlighted."

In the majority of ILDs, imaging modalities and especially high-resolution Computed Tomography (CT) scans have been the cornerstone in patient diagnostic approach and follow-up. The intricate nature of ILDs and the accompanying data have led to an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, primarily on imaging data but also in genetic data, spirometry and lung diffusion, among others. In this literature review, we describe the most prominent applications of AI in ILDs presented approximately within the last five years. We roughly stratify these studies in three categories, namely: (i) screening, (ii) diagnosis and classification, (iii) prognosis."

The capacity of a CNN to differentiate melanomas from combined naevi, the latter representing well-known melanoma simulators, has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of a CNN when used to differentiate melanomas from combined naevi in comparison with dermatologists.
METHODS: In this study, a CNN with regulatory approval for the European market (Moleanalyzer-Pro, FotoFinder Systems GmbH, Bad Birnbach, Germany) was used. We attained a dichotomous classification (benign, malignant) in dermoscopic images of 36 combined naevi and 36 melanomas with a mean Breslow thickness of 1.3 mm. Primary outcome measures were the CNN's sensitivity, specificity and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) in comparison with 11 dermatologists with different levels of experience.
RESULTS: The CNN revealed a sensitivity, specificity and DOR of 97.1% (95% CI [82.7-99.6]), 78.8% (95% CI [62.8-89.1.3]) and 34 (95% CI [4.8-239]), respectively. Dermatologists showed a lower mean sensitivity, specificity and DOR of 90.6% (95% CI [84.1-94.7]; P = 0.092), 71.0% (95% CI [62.6-78.1]; P = 0.256) and 24 (95% CI [11.6-48.4]; P = 0.1114). Under the assumption that dermatologists use the CNN to verify their (initial) melanoma diagnosis, dermatologists achieve an increased specificity of 90.3% (95% CI [79.8-95.6]) at an almost unchanged sensitivity. The largest benefit was observed in 'beginners', who performed worst without CNN verification (DOR = 12) but best with CNN verification (DOR = 98).
CONCLUSION: The tested CNN more accurately classified combined naevi and melanomas in comparison with trained dermatologists. Their diagnostic performance could be improved if the CNN was used to confirm/overrule an initial melanoma diagnosis. Application of a CNN may therefore be of benefit to clinicians."

Modeling methods that are used to simulate and predict the spread of COVID-19 include compartmental model, structured metapopulations, agent-based networks, deep learning, and complex network, with compartmental modeling as one of the most widely used methods. Compartmental model has two noteworthy features, a flexible framework that allows users to easily customize the model structure and its high adaptivity that allows well-matured approaches (e.g., Bayesian inference and mixed-effects modeling) to improve parameter estimation. We retrospectively evaluated the prediction performances of the compartmental models on the CDC COVID-19 Mathematical Modeling webpage based on data collected between August 2020 and February 2021, and subsequently discussed in detail their corresponding model enhancement. Finally, we presented examples using the compartmental models to assist policymaking. By evaluating all models in parallel, we systemically evaluated the performance and evolution of using compartmental models for COVID-19 pandemic prediction. In summary, as a 100-year-old epidemic approach, the compartmental model presents a powerful tool that is extremely adaptive and can be readily customized and implemented to address new data or emerging needs during a pandemic."

Deep learning (DL) is an emerging tool for medical diagnosis, though its value in IK is unclear. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of DL for IK and its comparative accuracy with ophthalmologists.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and clinical registries for studies related to DL for IK published between 1974 and July 16, 2024. We performed meta-analyses using bivariate models to estimate summary sensitivities and specificities. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022348596).
FINDINGS: Of 963 studies identified, 35 studies (136,401 corneal images from >56,011 patients) were included. Most studies had low risk of bias (68.6%) and low applicability concern (91.4%) in all domains of QUADAS-2, except the index test domain. Against the reference standard of expert consensus and/or microbiological results (seven external validation studies; 10,675 images), the summary estimates (95% CI) for sensitivity and specificity of DL for IK were 86.2% (71.6-93.9) and 96.3% (91.5-98.5). From 28 internal validation studies (16,059 images), summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 91.6% (86.8-94.8) and 90.7% (84.8-94.5). Based on seven studies (4007 images), DL and ophthalmologists had comparable summary sensitivity [89.2% (82.2-93.6) versus 82.2% (71.5-89.5); P = 0.20] and specificity [(93.2% (85.5-97.0) versus 89.6% (78.8-95.2); P = 0.45].
INTERPRETATION: DL models may have good diagnostic accuracy for IK and comparable performance to ophthalmologists. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the image-based analysis that did not account for potential correlation within individuals, relatively homogeneous population studies, lack of pre-specification of DL thresholds, and limited external validation. Future studies should improve their reporting, data diversity, external validation, transparency, and explainability to increase the reliability and generalisability of DL models for clinical deployment.

Simultaneously, to expand the sample size for further verification, we explored a deep learning algorithm to correctly classify molecular subtypes from H&E histology slides. We suggested that the renal pelvic group might have a proclivity towards luminal and the ureter towards basal and P53-like. Furthermore, we explore the heterogeneity of matrix and immune tumor microenvironment, and the ureteral group had more immune cell infiltration and higher stiffness. Collectively, these results showed that muscle-invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma exist in distinct properties of clinical characteristics, molecular subtype, and tumor microenvironment."

With our aging population, it may affect 288 million people globally by the year 2040. AMD progresses from an early and intermediate dry form to an advanced one, which manifests as choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy. Conversion to AMD-related exudation is known as progression to neovascular AMD, and presence of geographic atrophy is known as progression to advanced dry AMD. AMD progression predictions could enable timely monitoring, earlier detection and treatment, improving vision outcomes. Machine learning approaches, a subset of artificial intelligence applications, applied on imaging data are showing promising results in predicting progression. Extracted biomarkers, specifically from optical coherence tomography scans, are informative in predicting progression events. The purpose of this mini review is to provide an overview about current machine learning applications in artificial intelligence for predicting AMD progression, and describe the various methods, data-input types, and imaging modalities used to identify high-risk patients. With advances in computational capabilities, artificial intelligence applications are likely to transform patient care and management in AMD. External validation studies that improve generalizability to populations and devices, as well as evaluating systems in real-world clinical settings are needed to improve the clinical translations of artificial intelligence AMD applications."

Given its novelty and emergence in fields outside of biomedical research, machine learning terminology, techniques, and research findings may be unfamiliar to diabetes researchers. Our aim was to present the use of machine learning approaches in an approachable way, drawing from clinical epidemiological research in diabetes published from 1 Jan 2017 to 1 June 2020.
RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning approaches using tree-based learners-which produce decision trees to help guide clinical interventions-frequently have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional regression models for risk prediction. Machine learning approaches using neural networking and ""deep learning"" can be applied to medical image data, particularly for the identification and staging of diabetic retinopathy and skin ulcers. Among the machine learning approaches reviewed, researchers identified new strategies to develop standard datasets for rigorous comparisons across older and newer approaches, methods to illustrate how a machine learner was treating underlying data, and approaches to improve the transparency of the machine learning process. Machine learning approaches have the potential to improve risk stratification and outcome prediction for clinical epidemiology applications. Achieving this potential would be facilitated by use of universal open-source datasets for fair comparisons. More work remains in the application of strategies to communicate how the machine learners are generating their predictions."

Recent evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) has potential to be a promising tool for reducing the global burden of HTN, and furthering precision medicine related to cardiovascular (CV) diseases including HTN. Since AI can stimulate human thought processes and learning with complex algorithms and advanced computational power, AI can be applied to multimodal and big data, including genetics, epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, CV imaging, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors. AI demonstrates the ability to identify risk factors and phenotypes of HTN, predict the risk of incident HTN, diagnose HTN, estimate blood pressure (BP), develop novel cuffless methods for BP measurement, and comprehensively identify factors associated with treatment adherence and success. Moreover, AI has also been used to analyze data from major randomized controlled trials exploring different BP targets to uncover previously undescribed factors associated with CV outcomes. Therefore, AI-integrated HTN care has the potential to transform clinical practice by incorporating personalized prevention and treatment approaches, such as determining optimal and patient-specific BP goals, identifying the most effective antihypertensive medication regimen for an individual, and developing interventions targeting modifiable risk factors. Although the role of AI in HTN has been increasingly recognized over the past decade, it remains in its infancy, and future studies with big data analysis and N-of-1 study design are needed to further demonstrate the applicability of AI in HTN prevention and treatment."

This poses a serious threat to the current and near-future health systems, given the association of these conditions with different comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, and metabolic syndrome) and even death. In order to design appropriate strategies for its prevention, as well as understand its origins, the development of predictive models for childhood/adolescent overweight/obesity and related outcomes is of extreme value. Obesity has a complex etiology, and in the case of childhood and adolescence obesity, this etiology includes also specific factors like (pre)-gestational ones; weaning; and the huge anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal changes that during this period the body suffers. In this way, Machine Learning models are becoming extremely useful tools in this area, given their excellent predictive power; ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships between variables; and capacity to deal with high-dimensional data typical in this area. This is especially important given the recent appearance of large repositories of Electronic Health Records (EHR) that allow the development of models using datasets with many instances and predictor variables, from which Deep Learning variants can generate extremely accurate predictions. In the current work, the area of Machine Learning models to predict childhood and adolescent obesity and related outcomes is comprehensively and critically reviewed, including the latest ones using Deep Learning with EHR. These models are compared with the traditional statistical ones that used mainly logistic regression. The main features and applications appearing from these models are described, and the future opportunities are discussed."

OBJECTIVE: Due to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) popularity, it is important to predict postoperative complications, unfavorable 90-day readmissions, and two-year reoperations to improve surgical decision-making, prognostication, and planning.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Machine learning has been applied to predict postoperative complications for ACDF; however, studies were limited by sample size and model type. These studies achieved ≤0.70 area under the curve (AUC). Further approaches, not limited to ACDF, focused on specific complication types and resulted in AUC between 0.70 and 0.76.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and Medicare Supplement were queried from 2007 to 2016 to identify adult patients who underwent an ACDF procedure (N=176,816). Traditional machine learning algorithms, logistic regression, and support vector machines, were compared with deep neural networks to predict: 90-day postoperative complications, 90-day readmission, and two-year reoperation. We further generated random deep learning model architectures and trained them on the 90-day complication task to approximate an upper bound. Last, using deep learning, we investigated the importance of each input variable for the prediction of 90-day postoperative complications in ACDF.
RESULTS: For the prediction of 90-day complication, 90-day readmission, and two-year reoperation, the deep neural network-based models achieved AUC of 0.832, 0.713, and 0.671. Logistic regression achieved AUCs of 0.820, 0.712, and 0.671. Support vector machine approaches were significantly lower. The upper bound of deep learning performance was approximated as 0.832. Myelopathy, age, human immunodeficiency virus, previous myocardial infarctions, obesity, and documentary weakness were found to be the strongest variable to predict 90-day postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep neural network may be used to predict complications for clinical applications after multicenter validation. The results suggest limited added knowledge exists in interactions between the input variables used for this task. Future work should identify novel variables to increase predictive power."

However, the current deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction lack interpretability.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish an explainable deep learning model to provide individualized in-hospital mortality prediction and risk factor assessment for patients with AMI.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we used data for consecutive patients hospitalized with AMI from the Chongqing University Central Hospital between July 2016 and December 2022 and the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database. These patients were randomly divided into training (7668/10,955, 70%) and internal test (3287/10,955, 30%) data sets. In addition, data of patients with AMI from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database were used for external validation. Deep learning models were used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI, and they were compared with linear and tree-based models. The Shapley Additive Explanations method was used to explain the model with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in both the internal test and external validation data sets to quantify and visualize the features that drive predictions.
RESULTS: A total of 10,955 patients with AMI who were admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital or included in the Electronic Intensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database were randomly divided into a training data set of 7668 (70%) patients and an internal test data set of 3287 (30%) patients. A total of 9355 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database were included for independent external validation. In-hospital mortality occurred in 8.74% (670/7668), 8.73% (287/3287), and 9.12% (853/9355) of the patients in the training, internal test, and external validation cohorts, respectively. The Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model performed best in both the internal test data set and the external validation data set among the 9 prediction models, with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.87), respectively. Older age, high heart rate, and low body temperature were the 3 most important predictors of increased mortality, according to the explanations of the Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer model.
CONCLUSIONS: The explainable deep learning model that we developed could provide estimates of mortality and visual contribution of the features to the prediction for a patient with AMI. The explanations suggested that older age, unstable vital signs, and metabolic disorders may increase the risk of mortality in patients with AMI."

Understanding the genetic and molecular factors influencing ALS survival is crucial for disease management and therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a deep learning-powered genetic analysis framework to link rare noncoding genetic variants to ALS survival. Using data from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs, this method prioritizes functional noncoding variants using deep learning, links cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to target genes using epigenomics data, and integrates these data through gene-level burden tests to identify survival-modifying variants, CREs, and genes. We apply this approach to analyze 6,715 ALS genomes, and pinpoint four novel rare noncoding variants associated with survival, including chr7:76,009,472:C&gt;T linked to CCDC146. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of this variant increases CCDC146 expression in iPSC-derived MNs and exacerbates ALS-specific phenotypes, including TDP-43 mislocalization. Suppressing CCDC146 with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), showing no toxicity, completely rescues ALS-associated survival defects in neurons derived from sporadic ALS patients and from carriers of the ALS-associated G4C2-repeat expansion within C9ORF72. ASO targeting of CCDC146 may be a broadly effective therapeutic approach for ALS. Our framework provides a generic and powerful approach for studying noncoding genetics of complex human diseases."

With technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the COVID-19 scenario.
METHODS: The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are 'COVID-19', ' AI ', and 'Drug Repurposing'.
RESULTS: AI is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly."

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.
RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.
CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI."

Here, we propose a deep learning framework, called AkitaR, that leverages both genome sequences and genome-wide RNA-DNA interactions to investigate the roles of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) on genome folding in HFFc6 cells. In order to disentangle the cis- and trans-regulatory roles of caRNAs, we compared models with nascent transcripts, trans-located caRNAs, open chromatin data, or DNA sequence alone. Both nascent transcripts and trans-located caRNAs improved the models' predictions, especially at cell-type-specific genomic regions. Analyses of feature importance scores revealed the contribution of caRNAs at TAD boundaries, chromatin loops and nuclear sub-structures such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli to the models' predictions. Furthermore, we identified non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) known to regulate chromatin structures, such as MALAT1 and NEAT1, as well as several novel RNAs, RNY5, RPPH1, POLG-DT and THBS1-IT, that might modulate chromatin architecture through trans-interactions in HFFc6. Our modeling also suggests that transcripts from Alus and other repetitive elements may facilitate chromatin interactions through trans R-loop formation. Our findings provide new insights and generate testable hypotheses about the roles of caRNAs in shaping chromatin organization."

Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly employed in monitoring, screening, and identifying different cardiovascular clinical conditions. It was proposed that ML may be a useful tool for predicting POAF after cardiac surgery. An electronic database search was conducted on Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify primary studies that investigated the role of ML in predicting POAF after cardiac surgery. A total of 5,955 citations were subjected to title and abstract screening, and ultimately 5 studies were included. The reported incidence of POAF ranged from 21.5% to 37.1%. The studied ML models included: deep learning, decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, gradient boosting decision tree, gradient-boosted machine, K-nearest neighbors, neural network, and random forest models. The sensitivity of the reported ML models ranged from 0.22 to 0.91, the specificity from 0.64 to 0.84, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.67 to 0.94. Age, gender, left atrial diameter, glomerular filtration rate, and duration of mechanical ventilation were significant clinical risk factors for POAF. Limited evidence suggest that machine learning models may play a role in predicting atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery because of their ability to detect different patterns of correlations and the incorporation of several demographic and clinical variables.

Can we improve estimation of functional outcome with interpretable deep learning models using clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data?
METHODS: In this observational study, we collected data of 222 patients with middle cerebral artery M1 segment occlusion who received mechanical thrombectomy. In a 5-fold cross validation, we evaluated interpretable deep learning models for predicting functional outcome in terms of modified Rankin scale at 3 months using clinical variables, diffusion weighted imaging and perfusion weighted imaging, and a combination thereof. Based on 50 test patients, we compared model performances to those of 5 experienced stroke neurologists. Prediction performance for ordinal (modified Rankin scale score, 0-6) and binary (modified Rankin scale score, 0-2 versus 3-6) functional outcome was assessed using discrimination and calibration measures like area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy (percentage of correctly classified patients).
RESULTS: In the cross validation, the model based on clinical variables and diffusion weighted imaging achieved the highest binary prediction performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.766 [0.727-0.803]). Performance of models using clinical variables or diffusion weighted imaging only was lower. Adding perfusion weighted imaging did not improve outcome prediction. On the test set of 50 patients, binary prediction performance between model (accuracy, 60% [55.4%-64.4%]) and neurologists (accuracy, 60% [55.8%-64.21%]) was similar when using clinical data. However, models significantly outperformed neurologists when imaging data were provided, alone or in combination with clinical variables (accuracy, 72% [67.8%-76%] versus 64% [59.8%-68.4%] with clinical and imaging data). Prediction performance of neurologists with comparable experience varied strongly.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that early prediction of functional outcome in large vessel occlusion stroke patients may be significantly improved if neurologists are supported by interpretable deep learning models."

Information accessibility-coupled with the availability of tools and computational power to store, share, integrate, and analyze data with automatic and flexible algorithms-offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop tools to maximize farm profitability, reduce socio-environmental impacts, and increase animal and human health and welfare. A detailed description of all topics and applications of big data analysis in poultry farming would be infeasible. Therefore, the present work briefly reviews the application of sensor technologies, such as optical, acoustic, and wearable sensors, as well as infrared thermal imaging and optical flow, to poultry farming. The principles and benefits of advanced statistical techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, and their use in developing effective and reliable classification and prediction models to benefit the farming system, are also discussed. Finally, recent progress in pathogen genome sequencing and analysis is discussed, highlighting practical applications in epidemiological tracking, and reconstruction of microorganisms' population dynamics, evolution, and spread. The benefits of the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of applied control strategies are also considered. Although human-artificial intelligence collaborations in the livestock sector can be frightening because they require farmers and employees in the sector to adapt to new roles, challenges, and competencies-and because several unknowns, limitations, and open-ended questions are inevitable-their overall benefits appear to be far greater than their drawbacks. As more farms and companies connect to technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies will begin to play a greater role in identifying patterns and solutions to pressing problems in modern animal farming, thus providing remarkable production-based and commercial advantages. Moreover, the combination of diverse sources and types of data will also become fundamental for the development of predictive models able to anticipate, rather than merely detect, disease occurrence. The increasing availability of sensors, infrastructures, and tools for big data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis-together with the use of open standards and integration with pathogen molecular epidemiology-have the potential to address the major challenge of producing higher-quality, more healthful food on a larger scale in a more sustainable manner, thereby protecting ecosystems, preserving natural resources, and improving animal and human welfare and health."

The evasion of destruction by the immune system is one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer. We have built a dataset of 171,166 manually annotated CD3+ and CD8+ cells, which we used to train deep learning algorithms for automatic detection of lymphocytes in histopathology images to better quantify immune response. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of four deep learning based methods when different subcompartments of the whole-slide image are considered: normal tissue areas, areas with immune cell clusters, and areas containing artifacts. We have compared the proposed methods in breast, colon and prostate cancer tissue slides collected from nine different medical centers. Finally, we report the results of an observer study on lymphocyte quantification, which involved four pathologists from different medical centers, and compare their performance with the automatic detection. The results give insights on the applicability of the proposed methods for clinical use. U-Net obtained the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.78 and the highest agreement with manual evaluation (κ=0.72), whereas the average pathologists agreement with reference standard was κ=0.64.

Purpose To examine the ability of DL models to estimate the risk of interval and screening-detected breast cancers with and without clinical risk factors. Materials and Methods This study was performed on 25 096 digital screening mammograms obtained from January 2006 to December 2013. The mammograms were obtained in 6369 women without breast cancer, 1609 of whom developed screening-detected breast cancer and 351 of whom developed interval invasive breast cancer. A DL model was trained on the negative mammograms to classify women into those who did not develop cancer and those who developed screening-detected cancer or interval invasive cancer. Model effectiveness was evaluated as a matched concordance statistic (C statistic) in a held-out 26% (1669 of 6369) test set of the mammograms. Results The C statistics and odds ratios for comparing patients with screening-detected cancer versus matched controls were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.69) and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.33), respectively, for the DL model, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.65) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.32, 3.45) for the clinical risk factors with the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density model, and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.69) and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.30) for the combined DL and clinical risk factors model. For comparing patients with interval cancer versus controls, the C statistics and odds ratios were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.71) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.45), respectively, for the DL model, 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.77) and 7.25 (95% CI: 2.94, 17.9) for the risk factors with BI-RADS density (b rated vs non-b rated) model, and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.78) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.29) for the combined DL and clinical risk factors model. The P values between the DL, BI-RADS, and combined model's ability to detect screen and interval cancer were .99, .002, and .03, respectively. Conclusion The deep learning model outperformed in determining screening-detected cancer risk but underperformed for interval cancer risk when compared with clinical risk factors including breast density. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

OBJECTIVE: This study presents the first quantitative review of the success of these techniques in NMSC screening.
METHODS: A primary literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and arXiv, capturing all articles involving ML techniques and NMSC screening.
RESULTS: 52 articles were included for quantitative analysis, resulting in a mean sensitivity of 89.2% (n = 52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 87.0-91.3) and a mean specificity of 81.1% (n = 44, 95% CI 74.5-87.8) for ML algorithms in the diagnosis of NMSC. Studies were further grouped by skin cancer type, algorithm type, diagnostic gold standard, data set source, and data set size.
CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that an ML algorithm is superior at NMSC screening than a trained dermatologist utilizing dermoscopy for either BCC or SCC. Given that the studies included in this review were performed in silico, further study in the form of randomized clinical trials are needed to further elucidate the role of NMSC screening algorithms in dermatology."

METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and ScienceDirect databases were searched for studies reporting a comparison between the glaucoma diagnosis performance of deep learning and ophthalmologists on fundus examinations on the same datasets, until 10 December 2020. Studies had to report an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) with SD or enough data to generate one.
RESULTS: We included six studies in our meta-analysis. There was no difference in AUC between ophthalmologists (AUC = 82.0, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 65.4-98.6) and deep learning (97.0, 89.4-104.5). There was also no difference using several pessimistic and optimistic variants of our meta-analysis: the best (82.2, 60.0-104.3) or worst (77.7, 53.1-102.3) ophthalmologists versus the best (97.1, 89.5-104.7) or worst (97.1, 88.5-105.6) deep learning of each study. We did not retrieve any factors influencing those results.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning had similar performance compared to ophthalmologists in glaucoma diagnosis from fundus examinations. Further studies should evaluate deep learning in clinical situations."

This emerging field finds increasing applications in (mathematical) oncology. This review aims to capture the current state of the field and provides a perspective on how mechanistic learning may progress in the oncology domain. We highlight the synergistic potential of mechanistic learning and point out similarities and differences between purely data-driven and mechanistic approaches concerning model complexity, data requirements, outputs generated, and interpretability of the algorithms and their results. Four categories of mechanistic learning (sequential, parallel, extrinsic, intrinsic) of mechanistic learning are presented with specific examples. We discuss a range of techniques including physics-informed neural networks, surrogate model learning, and digital twins. Example applications address complex problems predominantly from the domain of oncology research such as longitudinal tumor response predictions or time-to-event modeling. As the field of mechanistic learning advances, we aim for this review and proposed categorization framework to foster additional collaboration between the data- and knowledge-driven modeling fields. Further collaboration will help address difficult issues in oncology such as limited data availability, requirements of model transparency, and complex input data which are embraced in a mechanistic learning framework."

This study proposes an integrated model using clinical features, radiomics, and deep learning based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images for survival prediction in patients with GBC after surgical resection.
METHODS: A total of 167 patients with GBC who underwent surgical resection at two medical institutions were retrospectively enrolled. After obtaining the pre-treatment CT images, the tumor lesions were manually segmented, and handcrafted radiomics features were extracted. A clinical prognostic signature and radiomics signature were built using machine learning algorithms based on the optimal clinical features or handcrafted radiomics features, respectively. Subsequently, a DenseNet121 model was employed for transfer learning on the radiomics image data and as the basis for the deep learning signature. Finally, we used logistic regression on the three signatures to obtain the unified multimodal model for comprehensive interpretation and analysis.
RESULTS: The integrated model performed better than the other models, exhibiting the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.870 in the test set, and the highest concordance index (C-index) of 0.736 in predicting patient survival rates. A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in high-risk group had a lower survival probability compared to those in low-risk group (log-rank p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nomogram is useful for predicting the survival of patients with GBC after surgical resection, helping in the identification of high-risk patients with poor prognosis and ultimately facilitating individualized management of patients with GBC."

This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings."

METHODS: A retrospective single-center observational study included patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma between 2007 and 2019. A set of 37 patients was used for technical validation of the algorithm, comparing manual vs DL-based evaluations. Segmentations were compared using mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), SMI using concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman plots. Overall survivals (OS) were compared using log-rank (Kaplan-Meier) and Mann-Whitney tests. Generalizability of the prognostic value was tested in an independent validation population (N = 87).
RESULTS: Differences between two manual segmentations (DSC = 0.91, CCC = 0.98 for areas) or manual vs. automated segmentation (DSC = 0.90, CCC = 0.98 for areas, CCC = 0.97 for SMI) had the same order of magnitude. Bland-Altman plots showed a mean difference of -3.33 cm2 [95%CI: -15.98, 9.1] between two manual segmentations, and -3.28 cm2 [95% CI: -14.77, 8.21] for manual vs. automated segmentations. With each method, 20/37 (56%) patients were classified as sarcopenic. Sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic groups had statistically different survival curves with median OS of 6.0 vs. 12.5 (p = 0.008) and 6.0 vs. 13.9 (p = 0.014) months respectively for manual and DL methods. In the independent validation population, sarcopenic patients according to DL had a lower OS (10.7 vs. 17.3 months, p = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: A DL algorithm allowed accurate estimation of SMI compared to manual reference standard. The DL-calculated SMI demonstrated a prognostic value in terms of OS.
KEY POINTS: • A deep learning algorithm allows accurate estimation of skeletal muscle index compared to a manual reference standard with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.97. • Sarcopenic patients according to SMI thresholds after segmentation by the deep learning algorithm had statistically significantly lower overall survival compared to non-sarcopenic patients."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that has not been yet implemented in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using WBE, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits available data from reliable sources to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks. The proposed framework could provide early detection of viruses, forecast risk maps and vulnerable areas, and estimate the number of infected citizens."

Epub 2023 Jun 1.,Yuan T,Artif Intell Med,2023,2023/09/06,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102589,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation biomarkers have great potential in improving prognostic classification systems for patients with cancer. Machine learning (ML)-based analytic techniques might help overcome the challenges of analyzing high-dimensional data in relatively small sample sizes. This systematic review summarizes the current use of ML-based methods in epigenome-wide studies for the identification of DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis.
METHODS: We searched three electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for articles published until 2 January 2023. ML-based methods and workflows used to identify DNA methylation signatures associated with cancer prognosis were extracted and summarized. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies by a seven-item checklist adapted from 'A Tool to Assess Risk of Bias and Applicability of Prediction Model Studies (PROBAST)' and from the 'Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK). Different ML methods and workflows used in included studies were summarized and visualized by a sunburst chart, a bubble chart, and Sankey diagrams, respectively.
RESULTS: Eighty-three studies were included in this review. Three major types of ML-based workflows were identified. 1) unsupervised clustering, 2) supervised feature selection, and 3) deep learning-based feature transformation. For the three workflows, the most frequently used ML techniques were consensus clustering, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and autoencoder, respectively. The systematic review revealed that the performance of these approaches has not been adequately evaluated yet and that methodological and reporting flaws were common in the identified studies using ML techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: There is great heterogeneity in ML-based methodological strategies used by epigenome-wide studies to identify DNA methylation markers associated with cancer prognosis. In theory, most existing workflows could not handle the high multi-collinearity and potentially non-linearity interactions in epigenome-wide DNA methylation data. Benchmarking studies are needed to compare the relative performance of various approaches for specific cancer types. Adherence to relevant methodological and reporting guidelines are urgently needed."

RECENT FINDINGS: AI was found to be diagnostically valuable in the evaluation of liver fibrosis, detection of cirrhosis, differentiation between compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, evaluation of portal hypertension, detection and differentiation of particular liver masses, preoperative evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma as well as response to treatment and estimation of graft survival in patients undergoing liver transplantation. AI additionally holds great promise in examination of structured electronic health records data as well as in examination of clinical text (using various natural language processing approaches). Despite its contributions, AI has several limitations, including the quality of existing data, small cohorts with possible sampling bias and the lack of well validated easily reproducible models.
SUMMARY: AI and deep learning models have extensive applicability in assessing liver disease. However, multicenter randomized controlled trials are indispensable to validate their utility."

Plus disease, defined as venous dilatation and arteriolar tortuosity within the posterior retinal vessels greater than or equal to that of a standard published photograph, is the most critical finding in identifying treatment-requiring ROP. Despite an internationally accepted definition of plus disease, there is significant variability in diagnostic process and outcome, producing variable levels of reported intra- and interexpert agreement. Several potential explanations for poor agreement have been proposed, including attention to undefined vascular features such as venous tortuosity, focus on narrower or wider field of view, unfamiliarity with digital images, the magnification and apparent severity of the standard photograph, and cut-off point differences among experts as to the level of tortuosity and dilation sufficient for ""plus disease"" along a continuum. Moreover, differences in diagnostic consistency among groups of experts separated both geographically and chronologically have been reported. These findings have implications for clinical care, research, and education, and highlight the need for a more precise definition of plus disease and objective diagnostic methods for ROP."

Epub 2024 Jul 2.,Zhang J,Eur Spine J,2024,2024/07/02,,,10.1007/s00586-024-08235-4,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) risk by integrating demographic, bone mineral density (BMD), CT imaging, and deep learning radiomics features from CT images.
METHODS: A total of 169 osteoporosis-diagnosed patients from three hospitals were randomly split into OVFs (n = 77) and Non-OVFs (n = 92) groups for training (n = 135) and test (n = 34). Demographic data, BMD, and CT imaging details were collected. Deep transfer learning (DTL) using ResNet-50 and radiomics features were fused, with the best model chosen via logistic regression. Cox proportional hazards models identified clinical factors. Three models were constructed: clinical, radiomics-DTL, and fusion (clinical-radiomics-DTL). Performance was assessed using AUC, C-index, Kaplan-Meier, and calibration curves. The best model was depicted as a nomogram, and clinical utility was evaluated using decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: BMD, CT values of paravertebral muscles (PVM), and paravertebral muscles' cross-sectional area (CSA) significantly differed between OVFs and Non-OVFs groups (P &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were found between training and test cohort. Multivariate Cox models identified BMD, CT values of PVM, and CSA<sub>PS</sub> reduction as independent OVFs risk factors (P &lt; 0.05). The fusion model exhibited the highest predictive performance (C-index: 0.839 in training, 0.795 in test). DCA confirmed the nomogram's utility in OVFs risk prediction.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a robust predictive model for OVFs risk, integrating BMD, CT data, and radiomics-DTL features, offering high sensitivity and specificity. The model's visualizations can inform OVFs prevention and treatment strategies."

The presence of a DFI renders machine learning (ML) systems extremely nonlinear, posing difficulties in CVD/stroke risk stratification. In addition, there is a limited number of well-explained ML paradigms due to comorbidity, sample size limits, and weak scientific and clinical validation methodologies. Deep neural networks (DNN) are potent machines for learning that generalize nonlinear situations. The objective of this article is to propose a novel investigation of deep learning (DL) solutions for predicting CVD/stroke risk in DFI patients. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search strategy was used for the selection of 207 studies. We hypothesize that a DFI is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality due to the worsening of atherosclerotic disease and affecting coronary artery disease (CAD). Since surrogate biomarkers for CAD, such as carotid artery disease, can be used for monitoring CVD, we can thus use a DL-based model, namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for CVD/stroke risk prediction in DFI patients, which combines covariates such as office and laboratory-based biomarkers, carotid ultrasound image phenotype (CUSIP) lesions, along with the DFI severity. We confirmed the viability of CVD/stroke risk stratification in the DFI patients. Strong designs were found in the research of the DL architectures for CVD/stroke risk stratification. Finally, we analyzed the AI bias and proposed strategies for the early diagnosis of CVD/stroke in DFI patients. Since DFI patients have an aggressive atherosclerotic disease, leading to prominent CVD/stroke risk, we, therefore, conclude that the DL paradigm is very effective for predicting the risk of CVD/stroke in DFI patients."

AI has garnered remarkable public notice with the release of deep learning models that can model anything from artwork to academic papers with minimal human intervention. Machine learning, a method that uses algorithms to extract information from raw data and represent it in a model, and deep learning, a method that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input with minimal human intervention, are increasingly leveraged to tackle problems in the health sector, including utilization for clinical decision support in cardiovascular medicine. Inherited arrhythmia syndromes are a clinical domain where multiple unanswered questions remain despite unprecedented progress over the past 2 decades with the introduction of large panel genetic testing and the first steps in precision medicine. In particular, AI tools can help address gaps in clinical diagnosis by identifying individuals with concealed or transient phenotypes; enhance risk stratification by elevating recognition of underlying risk burden beyond widely recognized risk factors; improve prediction of response to therapy, and further prognostication.

Postoperative survival stratification based on radiomics and deep learning (DL) algorithms may be useful for treatment decision-making and follow-up management. This study was aimed to develop and validate a DL model based on preoperative computed tomography (CT) for predicting postcystectomy overall survival (OS) in patients with MIBC.
METHODS: MIBC patients who underwent RC were retrospectively included from four centers, and divided into the training, internal validation, and external validation sets. A DL model incorporated the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was built for predicting OS using preoperative CT images. The authors assessed the prognostic accuracy of the DL model and compared it with classic handcrafted radiomics model and clinical model. Then, a deep learning radiomics nomogram (DLRN) was developed by combining clinicopathological factors, radiomics score (Rad-score) and deep learning score (DL-score). Model performance was assessed by C-index, KM curve, and time-dependent ROC curve.
RESULTS: A total of 405 patients with MIBC were included in this study. The DL-score achieved a much higher C-index than Rad-score and clinical model (0.690 vs. 0.652 vs. 0.618 in the internal validation set, and 0.658 vs. 0.601 vs. 0.610 in the external validation set). After adjusting for clinicopathologic variables, the DL-score was identified as a significantly independent risk factor for OS by the multivariate Cox regression analysis in all sets (all P <0.01). The DLRN further improved the performance, with a C-index of 0.713 (95% CI: 0.627-0.798) in the internal validation set and 0.685 (95% CI: 0.586-0.765) in external validation set, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A DL model based on preoperative CT can predict survival outcome of patients with MIBC, which may help in risk stratification and guide treatment decision-making and follow-up management."

We investigated the incidence of cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes using antidiabetic drugs from three classes, which were sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is).Materials and methods: We compared the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) among these drugs and developed a machine learning model for predicting MI in patients without prior heart disease. We analyzed US health plan data for patients without prior MI or insulin therapy who were aged ≥40 years at initial prescription and had not received oral antidiabetic drugs for ≥6 months previously. After developing a machine learning model to predict MI, proportional hazards analysis of MI incidence was conducted using the risk obtained with this model and the drug classes as explanatory variables.Results: We analyzed 199,116 patients (mean age: years), comprising 110,278 (58.6) prescribed DPP-4is, 43,538 (55.1) prescribed GLP-1RAs and 45,300 (55.3) prescribed SGLT-2is. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed higher precision of machine learning over logistic regression analysis. Proportional hazards analysis by machine learning revealed a significantly lower risk of MI with SGLT-2is or GLP-1RAs than DPP-4is (hazard ratio: 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.91, p = .0004 vs. 0.63, 0.56-0.72, p &lt; .0001). MI risk was also significantly lower with GLP-1RAs than SGLT-2is (0.77, 0.66-0.90, p = .001).Limitations: All patients analyzed were covered by US commercial health plans, so information on patients aged ≥65 years was limited and the socioeconomic background may have been biased. Also, the observation period differed among the three classes of drugs due to differing release dates.Conclusions: Machine learning analysis suggested the risk of MI was 37% lower for type 2 diabetes patients without prior MI using GLP-1RAs versus DPP-4is, while the risk was 19% lower for SGLT-2is versus DPP-4is."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively included 556 SCLC patients from three medical centers. The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts comprised 309, 133, and 114 patients, respectively. The OS signature was built using a unified fully connected neural network. A deep learning model was developed based on the OS signature. Clinical and combined models were developed and compared with a deep learning model. Additionally, the benefits of PCI were evaluated after stratification using an OS signature.
RESULTS: Within the internal and external validation cohorts, the deep learning model (concordance index [C-index] 0.745, 0.733) was far superior to the clinical model (C-index: 0.635, 0.630) in predicting OS, but slightly worse than the combined model (C-index: 0.771, 0.770). Additionally, the deep learning model had excellent calibration, clinical usefulness, and improved accuracy in classifying survival outcomes. Remarkably, patients at high risk had a survival benefit from PCI in both the limited and extensive stages (all P < 0.05), whereas no significant association was observed in patients at low risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based deep learning model exhibited promising performance in predicting the OS of SCLC patients. The OS signature may aid in individualized treatment planning to select patients who may benefit from PCI."

Many machine learning methods have been proposed for the computer-aided diagnosis between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Most of these methods utilized the location-specific handcrafted features based on the segmentation results to improve the diagnose performance. However, the prerequisite segmentation step is time-consuming and needs the intervention by lots of expert radiologists, which cannot be achieved in the areas with limited medical resources.
METHODS: We propose a generative adversarial feature completion and diagnosis network (GACDN) that simultaneously generates handcrafted features by radiomic counterparts and makes accurate diagnoses based on both original and generated features. Specifically, we first calculate the radiomic features from the CT images. Then, in order to fast obtain the location-specific handcrafted features, we use the proposed GACDN to generate them by its corresponding radiomic features. Finally, we use both radiomic features and location-specific handcrafted features for COVID-19 diagnosis.
RESULTS: For the performance of our generated location-specific handcrafted features, the results of four basic classifiers show that it has an average of 3.21% increase in diagnoses accuracy. Besides, the experimental results on COVID-19 dataset show that our proposed method achieved superior performance in COVID-19 vs. community acquired pneumonia (CAP) classification compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method significantly improves the diagnoses accuracy of COVID-19 vs. CAP in the condition of incomplete location-specific handcrafted features. Besides, it is also applicable in some regions lacking of expert radiologists and high-performance computing resources."

As compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures, we aimed to develop a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to classify osteopenia and osteoporosis with the use of lumbar spine X-ray images. Herein, we developed the DCNN models based on the training dataset, which comprising 1616 lumbar spine X-ray images from 808 postmenopausal women (aged 50 to 92 years). DXA-derived bone mineral density (BMD) measures were used as the reference standard. We categorized patients into three groups according to DXA BMD T-score: normal (T ≥ -1.0), osteopenia (-2.5 < T < -1.0), and osteoporosis (T ≤ -2.5). T-scores were calculated by using the BMD dataset of young Chinese female aged 20-40 years as a reference. A 3-class DCNN model was trained to classify normal BMD, osteoporosis, and osteopenia. Model performance was tested in a validation dataset (204 images from 102 patients) and two test datasets (396 images from 198 patients and 348 images from 147 patients respectively).

The results showed that in the test dataset 1, the model diagnosing osteoporosis achieved an AUC of 0.767 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.701-0.824) with sensitivity of 73.7% (95% CI: 62.3-83.1), the model diagnosing osteopenia achieved an AUC of 0.787 (95% CI: 0.723-0.842) with sensitivity of 81.8% (95% CI: 67.3-91.8); In the test dataset 2, the model diagnosing osteoporosis yielded an AUC of 0.726 (95% CI: 0.646-0.796) with sensitivity of 68.4% (95% CI: 54.8-80.1), the model diagnosing osteopenia yielded an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI, 0.737-0.870) with sensitivity of 85.3% (95% CI, 68.9-95.0). Accordingly, a deep learning diagnostic network may have the potential in screening osteoporosis and osteopenia based on lumbar spine radiographs. However, further studies are necessary to verify and improve the diagnostic performance of DCNN models."

Now, transforming these huge volumes of data into knowledge is the primary challenge in computational biology. The traditional methods of data analysis have failed to carry out the task. Hence, researchers are turning to machine learning based approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional big data. In machine learning, once a model is trained with a training dataset, it can be applied on a testing dataset which is independent. In current times, deep learning algorithms further promote the application of machine learning in several field of biology including plant virology.
MAIN BODY: Plant viruses have emerged as one of the principal global threats to food security due to their devastating impact on crops and vegetables. The emergence of new viral strains and species help viruses to evade the concurrent preventive methods. According to a survey conducted in 2014, plant viruses are anticipated to cause a global yield loss of more than thirty billion USD per year. In order to design effective, durable and broad-spectrum management protocols, it is very important to understand the mechanistic details of viral pathogenesis. The application of machine learning enables precise diagnosis of plant viral diseases at an early stage. Furthermore, the development of several machine learning-guided bioinformatics platforms has primed plant virologists to understand the host-virus interplay better. In addition, machine learning has tremendous potential in deciphering the pattern of plant virus evolution and emergence as well as in developing viable control options.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering a significant progress in the application of machine learning in understanding plant virology, this review highlights an introductory note on machine learning and comprehensively discusses the trends and prospects of machine learning in the diagnosis of viral diseases, understanding host-virus interplay and emergence of plant viruses."

Clinical notes in longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to detect cognitive decline earlier than it is noted in structured EHR fields as formal diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a deep learning model to detect evidence of cognitive decline from clinical notes in the EHR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Notes documented 4 years preceding the initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis were extracted from Mass General Brigham's Enterprise Data Warehouse for patients aged 50 years or older and with initial MCI diagnosis during 2019. The study was conducted from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Sections of notes for cognitive decline were labeled manually and 2 reference data sets were created. Data set I contained a random sample of 4950 note sections filtered by a list of keywords related to cognitive functions and was used for model training and testing. Data set II contained 2000 randomly selected sections without keyword filtering for assessing whether the model performance was dependent on specific keywords.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A deep learning model and 4 baseline models were developed and their performance was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC).
RESULTS: Data set I represented 1969 patients (1046 [53.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.0 [13.3] years). Data set II comprised 1161 patients (619 [53.3%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [10.2] years). With some overlap of patients deleted, the unique population was 2166. Cognitive decline was noted in 1453 sections (29.4%) in data set I and 69 sections (3.45%) in data set II. Compared with the 4 baseline models, the deep learning model achieved the best performance in both data sets, with AUROC of 0.971 (95% CI, 0.967-0.976) and AUPRC of 0.933 (95% CI, 0.921-0.944) for data set I and AUROC of 0.997 (95% CI, 0.994-0.999) and AUPRC of 0.929 (95% CI, 0.870-0.969) for data set II.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, a deep learning model accurately detected cognitive decline from clinical notes preceding MCI diagnosis and had better performance than keyword-based search and other machine learning models. These results suggest that a deep learning model could be used for earlier detection of cognitive decline in the EHRs."

However, reported immune subtypes mainly focus on levels of immune infiltration and are mostly based on a mono-omics profile. This study aimed to identify a comprehensive immune subtype for HNSCC via multi-omics clustering and build a novel subtype prediction system for clinical application. Data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and our independent multicenter cohort. Multi-omics clustering was performed to identify 3 clusters of 499 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas based on immune-related gene expression and somatic mutations. The immune characteristics and biological features of the obtained clusters were revealed by bioinformatics, and 3 immune subtypes were identified: 1) adaptive immune activation subtype predominantly enriched in T cells, 2) innate immune activation subtype predominantly enriched in macrophages, and 3) immune desert subtype. Subsequently, the clinical implications of each subtype were analyzed per clinical epidemiology. We found that adaptive immune activation showed better survival outcomes and had a similar response to chemotherapy with innate immune activation, whereas immune desert might be relatively resistant to chemotherapy. Moreover, a subtype prediction system was developed by deep learning with whole slide images and named HISMD: HNSCC Immune Subtypes via Multi-omics and Deep Learning. We endowed HISMD with interpretability through image-based key feature extraction. The clinical implications, biological significances, and predictive stability of HISMD were successfully verified by using our independent multicenter cohort data set. In summary, this study revealed the immune heterogeneity of HNSCC and obtained a novel, highly accurate, and interpretable immune subtyping prediction system. For clinical implementation in the future, additional validation and utility studies are warranted."

In this review, we argue that computational models can be both relevant and useful in neurodegenerative disease research and although the current established models have limitations in clinical practice, artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can improve our understanding of disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: In recent years, diverse computational approaches have been used to shed light on different aspects of neurodegenerative disease models. For example, linear and nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling regression, differential equation models, and event-based models have been applied to provide a better understanding of disease progression patterns and biomarker trajectories. Additionally, the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian network models, and deep-learning-based approaches have been used to predict the probability of future incidence of disease, whereas nonnegative matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of neurodegenerative disease data is possible through knowledge-based models which use prior knowledge to complement data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based models can include pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways perturbed in a given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge maps, which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease. Collectively, these established models have revealed high granular details and insights into neurodegenerative disease models.
SUMMARY: In conjunction with increasingly advanced computational approaches, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models, which can be broadly categorized into data-driven and knowledge-driven, have been developed. We review the state of the art data and knowledge-driven models and discuss the necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical application."

Epub 2019 Jul 18.,Walker A,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,2019,2019/07/20,,,10.1177/0003489419863822,"OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the principles of unsupervised learning, a novel technique which has increasingly been reported as a tool for the investigation of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). It represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approach to investigating CRS based upon the clinically recognized phenotypes of ""with polyps"" and ""without polyps"" and instead relies upon the application of complex mathematical models to derive subgroups which can then be further examined. This review article reports on the principles which underlie this investigative technique and some of the published examples in CRS.
METHODS: This review summarizes the different types of unsupervised learning techniques which have been described and briefly expounds upon their useful applications. A literature review of studies which have unsupervised learning is then presented to provide a practical guide to its uses and some of the new directions of investigations suggested by their findings.
RESULTS: The commonest unsupervised learning technique applied to rhinology research is cluster analysis, which can be further subdivided into hierarchical and non-hierarchical approaches. The mathematical principles which underpin these approaches are explained within this article. Studies which have used these techniques can be broadly divided into those which have used clinical data only and that which includes biomarkers. Studies which include biomarkers adhere closely to the established canon of CRS disease phenotypes, while those that use clinical data may diverge from the typical ""polyp versus non-polyp"" phenotypes and reflect subgroups of patients who share common symptom modifiers.
SUMMARY: Artificial intelligence is increasingly influential in health care research and machine learning techniques have been reported in the investigation of CRS, promising several interesting new avenues for research. However, when critically appraising studies which use this technique, the reader needs to be au fait with the limitations and appropriate uses of its application."

Several automated risk prediction models have been developed using retrospective clinical data and have evolved significantly over the years in terms of predictors of recurrence, data usage, and predictive techniques (statistical/machine learning [ML]).
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature review of the aforementioned statistical and ML models published between January 2008 and December 2022 through searching five digital databases-PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. The comprehensive search yielded a total of 163 papers and after a screening process focusing on papers that dealt exclusively with statistical/ML methods, only 23 papers were deemed appropriate for further analysis. We benchmarked the studies on the basis of development, evaluation metrics, and validation strategy with an added emphasis on racial diversity of patients included in the studies.
RESULTS: In total, 30.4% of the included studies use statistical techniques, while 69.6% are ML-based. Among these, traditional ML models (support vector machines, decision tree, logistic regression, and naïve Bayes) are the most frequently used (26.1%) along with deep learning (26.1%). Deep learning and ensemble learning provide the most accurate predictions (AUC = 0.94 each).
CONCLUSION: ML-based prediction models exhibit outstanding performance, yet their practical applicability might be hindered by limited interpretability and reduced generalization. Moreover, predictive models for BC recurrence often focus on limited variables related to tumor, treatment, molecular, and clinical features. Imbalanced classes and the lack of open-source data sets impede model development and validation. Furthermore, existing models predominantly overlook African and Middle Eastern populations, as they are trained and validated mainly on Caucasian and Asian patients."

Deep learning (DL) models have been used for ophthalmologic diagnoses. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence to summarize and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms for ROP by fundus images.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library on June 13, 2021, for studies using a DL algorithm to distinguish individuals with ROP of different grades, which provided accuracy measurements. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values and the area under the curve (AUC) of summary receiver operating characteristics curves (SROC) summarized overall test performance. The performances in validation and test datasets were assessed together and separately. Subgroup analyses were conducted between the definition and grades of ROP. Threshold and nonthreshold effects were tested to assess biases and evaluate accuracy factors associated with DL models.
RESULTS: Nine studies with fifteen classifiers were included in our meta-analysis. A total of 521,586 objects were applied to DL models. For combined validation and test datasets in each study, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.953 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.946-0.959) and 0.975 (0.973-0.977), respectively, and the AUC was 0.984 (0.978-0.989). For the validation dataset and test dataset, the AUC was 0.977 (0.968-0.986) and 0.987 (0.982-0.992), respectively. In the subgroup analysis of ROP vs. normal and differentiation of two ROP grades, the AUC was 0.990 (0.944-0.994) and 0.982 (0.964-0.999), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that DL models can play an essential role in detecting and grading ROP with high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability. The application of a DL-based automated system may improve ROP screening and diagnosis in the future."

The potential of such a model in clinical routine should be investigated. Purpose To develop a multitask deep learning model for grading radiographic hip osteoarthritis features on radiographs and compare its performance to that of attending-level radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed hip joints seen on weight-bearing anterior-posterior pelvic radiographs from participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Participants were recruited from February 2004 to May 2006 for baseline measurements, and follow-up was performed 48 months later. Femoral osteophytes (FOs), acetabular osteophytes (AOs), and joint-space narrowing (JSN) were graded as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas. Subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cysts were graded as present or absent. The participants were split at 80% (n = 3494), 10% (n = 437), and 10% (n = 437) by using split-sample validation into training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The multitask neural network was based on DenseNet-161, a shared convolutional features extractor trained with multitask loss function. Model performance was evaluated in the internal test set from the OAI and in an external test set by using temporal and geographic validation consisting of routine clinical radiographs. Results A total of 4368 participants (mean age, 61.0 years ± 9.2 [standard deviation]; 2538 women) were evaluated (15 364 hip joints on 7738 weight-bearing anterior-posterior pelvic radiographs). The accuracy of the model for assessing these five features was 86.7% (1333 of 1538) for FOs, 69.9% (1075 of 1538) for AOs, 81.7% (1257 of 1538) for JSN, 95.8% (1473 of 1538) for subchondral sclerosis, and 97.6% (1501 of 1538) for subchondral cysts in the internal test set, and 82.7% (86 of 104) for FOS, 65.4% (68 of 104) for AOs, 80.8% (84 of 104) for JSN, 88.5% (92 of 104) for subchondral sclerosis, and 91.3% (95 of 104) for subchondral cysts in the external test set.

Epub 2024 Sep 6.,Segar MW,Eur J Heart Fail,2024,2024/09/06,,,10.1002/ejhf.3443,"AIMS: Abnormalities in specific echocardiographic parameters and cardiac biomarkers have been reported among individuals with diabetes. However, a comprehensive characterization of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM), a subclinical stage of myocardial abnormalities that precede the development of clinical heart failure (HF), is lacking. In this study, we developed and validated a machine learning-based clustering approach to identify the high-risk DbCM phenotype based on echocardiographic and cardiac biomarker parameters.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among individuals with diabetes from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort who were free of cardiovascular disease and other potential aetiologies of cardiomyopathy (training, n = 1199), unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using echocardiographic parameters and cardiac biomarkers of neurohormonal stress and chronic myocardial injury (total 25 variables). The high-risk DbCM phenotype was identified based on the incidence of HF on follow-up. A deep neural network (DeepNN) classifier was developed to predict DbCM in the ARIC training cohort and validated in an external community-based cohort (Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS]; n = 802) and an electronic health record (EHR) cohort (n = 5071). Clustering identified three phenogroups in the derivation cohort. Phenogroup-3 (n = 324, 27% of the cohort) had significantly higher 5-year HF incidence than other phenogroups (12.1% vs. 4.6% [phenogroup 2] vs. 3.1% [phenogroup 1]) and was identified as the high-risk DbCM phenotype. The key echocardiographic predictors of high-risk DbCM phenotype were higher NT-proBNP levels, increased left ventricular mass and left atrial size, and worse diastolic function. In the CHS and University of Texas (UT) Southwestern EHR validation cohorts, the DeepNN classifier identified 16% and 29% of participants with DbCM, respectively. Participants with (vs. without) high-risk DbCM phenotype in the external validation cohorts had a significantly higher incidence of HF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.61 [1.18-2.19] in CHS and 1.34 [1.08-1.65] in the UT Southwestern EHR cohort).
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based techniques may identify 16% to 29% of individuals with diabetes as having a high-risk DbCM phenotype who may benefit from more aggressive implementation of HF preventive strategies."

They influence nearly all multi-site imaging modalities and biomarkers, and methods to compensate for them can improve reliability and generalizability in the analysis of genetics, omics, and clinical data. The origins of statistical site effects are complex and involve both technical differences (scanner vendor, head coil, acquisition parameters, imaging processing) and differences in sample characteristics (inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample size, ancestry) between sites. In an age of expanding international consortium research, there is a growing need to disentangle technical site effects from sample characteristics of interest. Numerous statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to control for, model, or attenuate site effects - yet to date, no comprehensive review has discussed the benefits and drawbacks of each for different use cases. Here, we provide an overview of the different existing statistical and machine learning methods developed to remove unwanted site effects from independently collected neuroimaging samples. We focus on linear mixed effect models, the ComBat technique and its variants, adjustments based on image quality metrics, normative modeling, and deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks. For each method, we outline the statistical foundation and summarize strengths and weaknesses, including their assumptions and conditions of use.

37440249,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Applying Deep Learning in the Prediction of the Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases From Retinal Images,"Hu W, Yii FSL, Chen R, Zhang X, Shang X, Kiburg K, Woods E, Vingrys A, Zhang L, Zhu Z, He M.",Transl Vis Sci Technol. 2023 Jul 3;12(7):14. doi: 10.1167/tvst.12.7.14.,Hu W,Transl Vis Sci Technol,2023,2023/07/13,PMC10353749,,10.1167/tvst.12.7.14,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence from studies using deep learning (DL) to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from retinal images.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 2022. We extracted data pertaining to predicted outcomes, model development, and validation and model performance metrics. Included studies were graded using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracies Studies 2 tool. Model performance was pooled across eligible studies using a random-effects meta-analysis model.
RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were included in the analysis. There were 42 CVD risk-related outcomes predicted from retinal images were identified, including 33 CVD risk factors, 4 cardiac imaging biomarkers, 2 CVD risk scores, the presence of CVD, and incident CVD. Three studies that aimed to predict the development of future CVD events reported an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) between 0.68 and 0.81. Models that used retinal images as input data had a pooled mean absolute error of 3.19 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.95-3.43) for age prediction; a pooled AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI = 0.95-0.97) for gender classification; a pooled AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI = 0.73-0.86) for diabetes detection; and a pooled AUROC of 0.86 (95% CI = 0.81-0.92) for the detection of chronic kidney disease. We observed a high level of heterogeneity and variation in study designs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although DL models appear to have reasonably good performance when it comes to predicting CVD risk, further work is necessary to evaluate the real-world applicability and predictive accuracy.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: DL-based CVD risk assessment from retinal images holds great promise to be translated to clinical practice as a novel approach for CVD risk assessment, given its simple, quick, and noninvasive nature."

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CIHNAL, Web of Science, IEEE, American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology abstract archives were searched for studies published between 2008 and 4 June 2023. Two authors independently screened and extracted the variables, and the results are presented using tables and forest plots.
RESULTS: Ten studies were selected from 2381. Over half of the studies used deep learning models, using Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society sacroiliitis criteria as the ground truth, and manually extracted the regions of interest. All studies reported the area under the curve as a performance index, ranging from 0.76 to 0.99. Sensitivity and specificity were the second-most commonly reported indices, with sensitivity ranging from 0.56 to 1.00 and specificity ranging from 0.67 to 1.00; these results are comparable to a radiologist's sensitivity of 0.67-1.00 and specificity of 0.78-1.00 in the same cohort. More than half of the studies showed a high risk of bias in the analysis domain of quality appraisal owing to the small sample size or overfitting issues.
CONCLUSION: The performance of machine learning algorithms in discriminating sacroiliitis features on MRI varied owing to the high heterogeneity between studies and the small sample sizes, overfitting, and under-reporting issues of individual studies. Further well-designed and transparent studies are required."

DESIGN: Application of deep learning models to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) dataset.
PARTICIPANTS: FAF and CFP images (n = 11 535) from 2450 AREDS2 participants. Gold standard labels from reading center grading of the FAF images were transferred to the corresponding CFP images.
METHODS: A deep learning model was trained to detect RPD in eyes with intermediate to late AMD using FAF images (FAF model). Using label transfer from FAF to CFP images, a deep learning model was trained to detect RPD from CFP (CFP model). Performance was compared with 4 ophthalmologists using a random subset from the full test set.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), κ value, accuracy, and F1 score.
RESULTS: The FAF model had an AUC of 0.939 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.927-0.950), a κ value of 0.718 (95% CI, 0.685-0.751), and accuracy of 0.899 (95% CI, 0.887-0.911). The CFP model showed equivalent values of 0.832 (95% CI, 0.812-0.851), 0.470 (95% CI, 0.426-0.511), and 0.809 (95% CI, 0.793-0.825), respectively. The FAF model demonstrated superior performance to 4 ophthalmologists, showing a higher κ value of 0.789 (95% CI, 0.675-0.875) versus a range of 0.367 to 0.756 and higher accuracy of 0.937 (95% CI, 0.907-0.963) versus a range of 0.696 to 0.933. The CFP model demonstrated substantially superior performance to 4 ophthalmologists, showing a higher κ value of 0.471 (95% CI, 0.330-0.606) versus a range of 0.105 to 0.180 and higher accuracy of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.798-0.886) versus a range of 0.717 to 0.814.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-enabled automated detection of RPD presence from FAF images achieved a high level of accuracy, equal or superior to that of ophthalmologists. Automated RPD detection using CFP achieved a lower accuracy that still surpassed that of ophthalmologists. Deep learning models can assist, and even augment, the detection of this clinically important AMD-associated lesion."

These technologies show enormous potential for measuring key parameters of malaria, a disease that still causes about 250 million cases and 620,000 deaths, annually. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the combination of IR spectroscopy and machine learning (ML) can yield accurate predictions of epidemiologically relevant parameters of malaria in both laboratory and field surveys. Proven applications now include determining the age, species, and blood-feeding histories of mosquito vectors as well as detecting malaria parasite infections in both humans and mosquitoes. As the World Health Organization encourages malaria-endemic countries to improve their surveillance-response strategies, it is crucial to consider whether IR and ML techniques are likely to meet the relevant feasibility and cost-effectiveness requirements-and how best they can be deployed. This paper reviews current applications of IR spectroscopy and ML approaches for investigating malaria indicators in both field surveys and laboratory settings, and identifies key research gaps relevant to these applications. Additionally, the article suggests initial target product profiles (TPPs) that should be considered when developing or testing these technologies for use in low-income settings."

Along with this, epidemiological machine learning studies of SARS-CoV-2 have been frequently published. While these models can be perceived as precise and policy-relevant to guide governments towards optimal containment policies, their black box nature can hamper building trust and relying confidently on the prescriptions proposed. This paper focuses on interpretable AI-based epidemiological models in the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We systematically review existing studies, which jointly incorporate AI, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, and explainable AI approaches (XAI). First, we propose a conceptual framework by synthesizing the main methodological features of the existing AI pipelines of SARS-CoV-2. Upon the proposed conceptual framework and by analyzing the selected epidemiological studies, we reflect on current research gaps in epidemiological AI toolboxes and how to fill these gaps to generate enhanced policy support in the next potential pandemic."

Current histological assessment of TSR is limited by tissue accessibility and spatial heterogeneity. The authors aimed to develop a multitask deep learning (MDL) model to noninvasively predict TSR and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study including 2268 patients with resected CRC recruited from four centres, the authors developed an MDL model using preoperative computed tomography (CT) images for the simultaneous prediction of TSR and overall survival. Patients in the training cohort ( n =956) and internal validation cohort (IVC, n =240) were randomly selected from centre I. Patients in the external validation cohort 1 (EVC1, n =509), EVC2 ( n =203), and EVC3 ( n =360) were recruited from other three centres. Model performance was evaluated with respect to discrimination and calibration. Furthermore, the authors evaluated whether the model could predict the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The MDL model demonstrated strong TSR discrimination, yielding areas under the receiver operating curves (AUCs) of 0.855 (95% CI, 0.800-0.910), 0.838 (95% CI, 0.802-0.874), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.804-0.909) in the three validation cohorts, respectively. The MDL model was also able to predict overall survival and disease-free survival across all cohorts. In multivariable Cox analysis, the MDL score (MDLS) remained an independent prognostic factor after adjusting for clinicopathological variables (all P <0.05). For stage II and stage III disease, patients with a high MDLS benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.391 (95% CI, 0.230-0.666), P =0.0003; HR=0.467 (95% CI, 0.331-0.659), P <0.0001, respectively], whereas those with a low MDLS did not.
CONCLUSION: The multitask DL model based on preoperative CT images effectively predicted TSR status and survival in CRC patients, offering valuable guidance for personalized treatment. Prospective studies are needed to confirm its potential to select patients who might benefit from chemotherapy."

In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed."

METHODS: Systematic search of medical literature from PubMed and engineering literature from Compendex up to June 2, 2023. One reviewer screened studies that used EEG-based ML models to predict the neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest. Four reviewers validated that the studies met selection criteria. Nine variables were manually extracted. The top-five common EEG features were calculated. We evaluated each study's risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies guideline.
RESULTS: Out of 351 identified studies, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Random Forest (RF) (n = 7) was the most common ML model in the conventional ML category (n = 11), followed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (n = 4) in the DNN category (n = 6). The AUCs for RF ranged between 0.8 and 0.97, while CNN had AUCs between 0.7 and 0.92. The top-three commonly used EEG features were band power (n = 12), Shannon's Entropy (n = 11), burst-suppression ratio (n = 9).
CONCLUSIONS: RF and CNN were the two most common ML models with the highest AUCs for predicting the neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest. Using a multimodal model that combines EEG features and electronic health record data may further improve prognostic performance."

By training a deep neural network, further information in the mammographic images can be considered. Purpose To develop a risk score that is associated with future breast cancer and compare it with density-based models. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all women aged 40-74 years within the Karolinska University Hospital uptake area in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in 2013-2014 were included along with healthy control subjects. Network development was based on cases diagnosed from 2008 to 2012. The deep learning (DL) risk score, dense area, and percentage density were calculated for the earliest available digital mammographic examination for each woman. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the association with subsequent breast cancer. False-negative rates were obtained for the DL risk score, age-adjusted dense area, and age-adjusted percentage density. Results A total of 2283 women, 278 of whom were later diagnosed with breast cancer, were evaluated. The age at mammography (mean, 55.7 years vs 54.6 years; P &lt; .001), the dense area (mean, 38.2 cm2 vs 34.2 cm2; P &lt; .001), and the percentage density (mean, 25.6% vs 24.0%; P &lt; .001) were higher among women diagnosed with breast cancer than in those without a breast cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were higher for age-adjusted DL risk score than for dense area and percentage density: 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48, 1.64; AUC, 0.65), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.38; AUC, 0.60), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.25; AUC, 0.57), respectively (P &lt; .001 for AUC). The false-negative rate was lower: 31% (95% CI: 29%, 34%), 36% (95% CI: 33%, 39%; P = .006), and 39% (95% CI: 37%, 42%; P &lt; .001); this difference was most pronounced for more aggressive cancers. Conclusion Compared with density-based models, a deep neural network can more accurately predict which women are at risk for future breast cancer, with a lower false-negative rate for more aggressive cancers. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

METHOD: A task force was convened to examine and integrate findings from the scientific literature related to machine learning and big data based studies to clarify terminology and to describe challenges and potential applications in the field of BD. We also systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for articles published up to January 2019 that used machine learning in BD.
RESULTS: The results suggested that big data analytics has the potential to provide risk calculators to aid in treatment decisions and predict clinical prognosis, including suicidality, for individual patients. This approach can advance diagnosis by enabling discovery of more relevant data-driven phenotypes, as well as by predicting transition to the disorder in high-risk unaffected subjects. We also discuss the most frequent challenges that big data analytics applications can face, such as heterogeneity, lack of external validation and replication of some studies, cost and non-stationary distribution of the data, and lack of appropriate funding.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based studies, including atheoretical data-driven big data approaches, provide an opportunity to more accurately detect those who are at risk, parse-relevant phenotypes as well as inform treatment selection and prognosis. However, several methodological challenges need to be addressed in order to translate research findings to clinical settings."

DESIGN: Analysis of existing database of posterior pole fundus images and corresponding ophthalmoscopic examinations using 2 methods of assigning a quantitative scale to vascular severity.
PARTICIPANTS: Images were from clinical examinations of patients in the Imaging and Informatics in ROP Consortium. Four ophthalmologists and 1 study coordinator evaluated vascular severity on a scale from 1 to 9.
METHODS: A quantitative vascular severity score (1-9) was applied to each image using a deep learning algorithm. A database of 499 images was developed for assessment of interobserver agreement.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of deep learning-derived vascular severity scores with the clinical assessment of zone (I, II, or III), stage (0, 1, 2, or 3), and extent (<3 clock hours, 3-6 clock hours, and >6 clock hours) of stage 3 evaluated using multivariate linear regression and weighted κ values and Pearson correlation coefficients for interobserver agreement on a 1-to-9 vascular severity scale.
RESULTS: For deep learning analysis, a total of 6344 clinical examinations were analyzed. A higher deep learning-derived vascular severity score was associated with more posterior disease, higher disease stage, and higher extent of stage 3 disease (P < 0.001 for all). For a given ROP stage, the vascular severity score was higher in zone I than zones II or III (P < 0.001). Multivariate regression found zone, stage, and extent all were associated independently with the severity score (P < 0.001 for all). For interobserver agreement, the mean ± standard deviation weighted κ value was 0.67 ± 0.06, and the Pearson correlation coefficient ± standard deviation was 0.88 ± 0.04 on the use of a 1-to-9 vascular severity scale.

The rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide some suggestions for future works."

Epub 2024 May 3.,Oo MM,ESC Heart Fail,2024,2024/05/03,PMC11424299,,10.1002/ehf2.14828,"AIMS: Electronic health records (EHR) linked to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), biological specimens, and deep learning (DL) algorithms could potentially improve patient care through automated case detection and surveillance. We hypothesized that by applying keyword searches to routinely stored EHR, in conjunction with AI-powered automated reading of DICOM echocardiography images and analysing biomarkers from routinely stored plasma samples, we were able to identify heart failure (HF) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used EHR data between 1993 and 2021 from Tayside and Fife (~20% of the Scottish population). We implemented a keyword search strategy complemented by filtering based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and prescription data to EHR data set. We then applied DL for the automated interpretation of echocardiographic DICOM images. These methods were then integrated with the analysis of routinely stored plasma samples to identify and categorize patients into HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and controls without HF. The final diagnosis was verified through a manual review of medical records, measured natriuretic peptides in stored blood samples, and by comparing clinical outcomes among groups. In our study, we selected the patient cohort through an algorithmic workflow. This process started with 60 850 EHR data and resulted in a final cohort of 578 patients, divided into 186 controls, 236 with HFpEF, and 156 with HFrEF, after excluding individuals with mismatched data or significant valvular heart disease. The analysis of baseline characteristics revealed that compared with controls, patients with HFrEF and HFpEF were generally older, had higher BMI, and showed a greater prevalence of co-morbidities such as diabetes, COPD, and CKD. Echocardiographic analysis, enhanced by DL, provided high coverage, and detailed insights into cardiac function, showing significant differences in parameters such as left ventricular diameter, ejection fraction, and myocardial strain among the groups. Clinical outcomes highlighted a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality for HF patients compared with controls, with particularly elevated risk ratios for both HFrEF and HFpEF groups. The concordance between the algorithmic selection of patients and manual validation demonstrated high accuracy, supporting the effectiveness of our approach in identifying and classifying HF subtypes, which could significantly impact future HF diagnosis and management strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the feasibility of combining keyword searches in EHR, DL automated echocardiographic interpretation, and biobank resources to identify HF subtypes."

However, manual assessment of Nottingham Histological Grade (NHG) has high inter-assessor and inter-laboratory variability, causing uncertainty in grade assignments. To address this challenge, we developed and validated a three-level NHG-like deep learning-based histological grade model (predGrade). The primary performance evaluation focuses on prognostic performance.
METHODS: This observational study is based on two patient cohorts (SöS-BC-4, N = 2421 (training and internal test); SCAN-B-Lund, N = 1262 (test)) that include routine histological whole-slide images (WSIs) together with patient outcomes. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model with an attention mechanism was optimised for the classification of the three-level histological grading (NHG) from haematoxylin and eosin-stained WSIs. The prognostic performance was evaluated by time-to-event analysis of recurrence-free survival and compared to clinical NHG grade assignments in the internal test set as well as in the fully independent external test cohort.
RESULTS: We observed effect sizes (hazard ratio) for grade 3 versus 1, for the conventional NHG method (HR = 2.60 (1.18-5.70 95%CI, p-value = 0.017)) and the deep learning model (HR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.07-4.82, p-value = 0.033) on the internal test set after adjusting for established clinicopathological risk factors. In the external test set, the unadjusted HR for clinical NHG 2 versus 1 was estimated to be 2.59 (p-value = 0.004) and clinical NHG 3 versus 1 was estimated to be 3.58 (p-value < 0.001). For predGrade, the unadjusted HR for predGrade 2 versus 1 HR = 2.52 (p-value = 0.030), and 4.07 (p-value = 0.001) for preGrade 3 versus 1 was observed in the independent external test set. In multivariable analysis, HR estimates for neither clinical NHG nor predGrade were found to be significant (p-value > 0.05). We tested for differences in HR estimates between NHG and predGrade in the independent test set and found no significant difference between the two classification models (p-value > 0.05), confirming similar prognostic performance between conventional NHG and predGrade.
CONCLUSION: Routine histopathology assessment of NHG has a high degree of inter-assessor variability, motivating the development of model-based decision support to improve reproducibility in histological grading. We found that the proposed model (predGrade) provides a similar prognostic performance as clinical NHG. The results indicate that deep CNN-based models can be applied for breast cancer histological grading."

As such, it should lend itself ideally to data science methods, where computer science, statistics, and clinical knowledge are combined to advance state-of-the-art care. Nevertheless, data science methods in radiation oncology research are still in their infancy and successful applications leading to improved patient care remain scarce. Here, we discuss data interoperability issues within and across organizational boundaries that hamper the introduction of big data and data science techniques in radiation oncology. At the semantic level, creating common underlying models and codification of the data, including the use of data elements with standardized definitions, an ontology, remains a work in progress. Methodological issues in data science and in the use of large population-based health data registries are identified. We show that data science methods and big data cannot replace randomized clinical trials in comparative effectiveness research by reviewing a series of instances where the outcomes of big data analyses and randomized trials are at odds. We also discuss the modern wave of machine learning and artificial intelligence as represented by deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Finally, we identify promising research avenues and remain optimistic that the data sources in radiation oncology can be linked to yield important insights in the near future. We argue that data science will be a valuable complement to, but not a replacement of, the traditional hypothesis-driven translational research chain and the randomized clinical trials that form the backbone of evidence-based medicine."

Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed. The proposed semi-supervised text classification framework was successfully applied in research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context."

Here, we discuss some exciting recent results of self-supervised learning (SSL) applications to high-resolution health signals. These examples leverage unlabeled data to learn meaningful representations that can generalize to situations where the ground truth is inadequate or simply infeasible to collect due to the high burden or associated costs. The most prominent bottleneck of deep learning today is access to labeled, carefully curated datasets, and self-supervision on health signals opens up new possibilities to eliminate data silos through general-purpose models that can transfer to low-resource environments and tasks."

Traditional case-identification methods using claims data can be time-intensive and may miss important subgroups. We hypothesized that a deep learning model analyzing electronic health records (EHR) can more accurately identify AAV cases.
METHODS: We examined the Mass General Brigham (MGB) repository of clinical documentation from 12/1/1979 to 5/11/2021, using expert-curated keywords and ICD codes to identify a large cohort of potential AAV cases. Three labeled datasets (I, II, III) were created, each containing note sections. We trained and evaluated a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for note-level classification, using metrics like positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision and recall curve (AUPRC). The deep learning model was further evaluated for its ability to classify AAV cases at the patient-level, compared with rule-based algorithms in 2,000 randomly chosen samples.
RESULTS: Datasets I, II, and III comprised 6,000, 3,008, and 7,500 note sections, respectively. Deep learning achieved the highest AUROC in all three datasets, with scores of 0.983, 0.991, and 0.991. The deep learning approach also had among the highest PPVs across the three datasets (0.941, 0.954, and 0.800, respectively). In a test cohort of 2,000 cases, the deep learning model achieved a PPV of 0.262 and an estimated sensitivity of 0.975. Compared to the best rule-based algorithm, the deep learning model identified six additional AAV cases, representing 13% of the total.
CONCLUSION: The deep learning model effectively classifies clinical note sections for AAV diagnosis. Its application to EHR notes can potentially uncover additional cases missed by traditional rule-based methods."

Visual impairment and blindness due to DR can be prevented by early detection and management of sight-threatening DR. Life-long evaluation by repetitive retinal screening of people with diabetes is an essential strategy as DR has an asymptomatic presentation. Fundus examination by trained ophthalmologists and fundus photography are established modes of screening. Various modes of opportunistic screening have been followed in India. Hospital-based screening (diabetes care/eye care) and community-based screening are the common modes. Tele-ophthalmology programs based on retinal imaging, remote interpretation, and grading of DR by trained graders/ophthalmologists have facilitated greater coverage of DR screening and enabled timely referral of those with sight-threatening DR. DR screening programs use nonmydriatic or mydriatic fundus cameras for retinal photography. Hand-held/smartphone-based fundus cameras that are portable, less expensive, and easy to use in remote places are gaining popularity. Good retinal image quality and accurate diagnosis play an important role in reducing unnecessary referrals. Recent advances like nonmydriatic ultrawide field fundus photography can be used for DR screening, though likely to be more expensive. The advent of artificial intelligence and deep learning has raised the possibility of automated detection of DR. Efforts to increase the awareness regarding DR is essential to ensure compliance to regular follow-up. Cost-effective sustainable models will ensure systematic nation-wide DR screening in the country."

To expedite the process of providing treatment to those who have contracted the disease and to ensure the accessibility of effective drugs, numerous strategies have been implemented to find potential anti-COVID-19 drugs in a short span of time. Motivated by this critical global challenge, in this review, we detail approaches that have been used for drug repurposing for COVID-19 and suggest improvements to the existing deep learning (DL) approach to identify and repurpose drugs to treat this complex disease. By optimizing hyperparameter settings, deploying suitable activation functions, and designing optimization algorithms, the improved DL approach will be able to perform feature extraction from quality big data, turning the traditional DL approach, referred to as a ""black box,"" which generalizes and learns the transmitted data, into a ""glass box"" that will have the interpretability of its rationale while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy. When adopted for drug repurposing for COVID-19, this improved approach will create a new generation of DL approaches that can establish a cause and effect relationship as to why the repurposed drugs are suitable for treating COVID-19. Its ability can also be extended to repurpose drugs for other complex diseases, develop appropriate treatment strategies for new diseases, and provide precision medical treatment to patients, thus paving the way to discover new drugs that can potentially be effective for treating COVID-19."

J48 decision tree method classifies the deep characteristics of affected X-ray corona images to detect the contaminated patients effectively. Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics. The proposed model is, therefore, useful for the real-time classification of X-ray chest images of COVID-19 disease."

Determining the association between drugs and ADRs is crucial, and several methods have been proposed to demonstrate this association. This systematic review aimed to examine the analytical tools by considering original articles that utilized statistical and machine learning methods for detecting ADRs.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted based on articles published between 2015 and 2020. The keywords used were statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods for detecting ADR signals. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS: We reviewed 72 articles, of which 51 and 21 addressed statistical and machine learning methods, respectively. Electronic medical record (EMR) data were exclusively analyzed using the regression method. For FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data, components of the disproportionality method were preferable. DrugBank was the most used database for machine learning. Other methods accounted for the highest and supervised methods accounted for the second highest.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the 72 main articles, this review provides guidelines on which databases are frequently utilized and which analysis methods can be connected. For statistical analysis, >90% of the cases were analyzed by disproportionate or regression analysis with each spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data or electronic medical record (EMR) data; for machine learning research, however, there was a strong tendency to analyze various data combinations. Only half of the DrugBank database was occupied, and the k-nearest neighbor method accounted for the greatest proportion."

METHODS: A total of 414 patients with whole slide images, computed tomography images, and clinical data from three patient cohorts were retrospectively analyzed. The authors performed deep learning and machine learning algorithm to construct three single-modality prediction models for disease-free survival of ccRCC based on whole slide images, cell segmentation, and computed tomography images, respectively. A multimodel prediction signature (MMPS) for disease-free survival were further developed by combining three single-modality prediction models and tumor stage/grade system. Prognostic performance of the prognostic model was also verified in two independent validation cohorts.
RESULTS: Single-modality prediction models performed well in predicting the disease-free survival status of ccRCC. The MMPS achieved higher area under the curve value of 0.742, 0.917, and 0.900 in three independent patient cohorts, respectively. MMPS could distinguish patients with worse disease-free survival, with HR of 12.90 (95% CI: 2.443-68.120, P <0.0001), 11.10 (95% CI: 5.467-22.520, P <0.0001), and 8.27 (95% CI: 1.482-46.130, P <0.0001) in three different patient cohorts. In addition, MMPS outperformed single-modality prediction models and current clinical prognostic factors, which could also provide complements to current risk stratification for adjuvant therapy of ccRCC.
CONCLUSION: Our novel multimodel prediction analysis for disease-free survival exhibited significant improvements in prognostic prediction for patients with ccRCC. After further validation in multiple centers and regions, the multimodal system could be a potential practical tool for clinicians in the treatment for ccRCC patients."

METHODS: T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time maps were analyzed for 4,384 subjects from the baseline Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Dataset. Voxel Based Relaxometry (VBR) was used for automatic quantification and voxel-based analysis of the differences in T<sub>2</sub> between subjects with and without radiographic OA. A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet) was trained to diagnose OA from T<sub>2</sub> data. For comparison, more classical feature extraction techniques and shallow classifiers were used to benchmark the performance of our algorithm's results. Deep and shallow models were evaluated with and without the inclusion of risk factors. Sensitivity and Specificity values and McNemar test were used to compare the performance of the different classifiers.
RESULTS: The best shallow model was obtained when the first ten Principal Components, demographics and pain score were included as features (AUC = 77.77%, Sensitivity = 67.01%, Specificity = 71.79%). In comparison, DenseNet trained on raw T<sub>2</sub> data obtained AUC = 83.44%, Sensitivity = 76.99%, Specificity = 77.94%. McNemar test on two misclassified proportions form the shallow and deep model showed that the boost in performance was statistically significant (McNemar's chi-squared = 10.33, degree of freedom (DF) = 1, P-value = 0.0013).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we presented a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based data-driven platform using T<sub>2</sub> measurements to characterize radiographic OA. Our results showed that feature learning from T<sub>2</sub> maps has potential in uncovering information that can potentially better diagnose OA than simple averages or linear patterns decomposition."

This study aimed to develop a deep learning model, iGNet, to assist in the differentiation and prognostication of iGCT subtypes by employing pretherapeutic MR T2-weighted imaging.
METHODS: The iGNet model, which is based on the nnUNet architecture, was developed using a retrospective dataset of 280 pathologically confirmed iGCT patients. The training dataset included 83 GEs and 117 NGGCTs, while the retrospective internal test dataset included 31 GEs and 49 NGGCTs. The model's diagnostic performance was then assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a prospective internal dataset (n = 22) and two external datasets (n = 22 and 20). Next, we compared the diagnostic performance of six neuroradiologists with or without the assistance of iGNet. Finally, the predictive ability of the output of iGNet for progression-free and overall survival was assessed and compared to that of the pathological diagnosis.
RESULTS: iGNet achieved high diagnostic performance, with AUCs between 0.869 and 0.950 across the four test datasets. With the assistance of iGNet, the six neuroradiologists' diagnostic AUCs (averages of the four test datasets) increased by 9.22% to 17.90%. There was no significant difference between the output of iGNet and the results of pathological diagnosis in predicting progression-free and overall survival (P = .889).
CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging pretherapeutic MR imaging data, iGNet accurately differentiates iGCT subtypes, facilitating prognostic evaluation and increasing the potential for tailored treatment."

DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic test or technology.
SUBJECTS: Deep learning models were trained, validated, and tested on 5255 wide-angle retinal images in the neonatal intensive care units of 7 institutions as part of the Imaging and Informatics in ROP study. All images were labeled for the presence of plus, preplus, or no plus disease with a clinical label and a reference standard diagnosis (RSD) determined by 3 image-based ROP graders and the clinical diagnosis.
METHODS: We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for models developed on multi-institutional data, using a central approach initially, followed by FL, and compared locally trained models with both approaches. We compared the model performance (κ) with the label agreement (between clinical and RSD), data set size, and number of plus disease cases in each training cohort using the Spearman correlation coefficient (CC).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model performance using AUROC and linearly weighted κ.
RESULTS: Four settings of experiment were used: FL trained on RSD against central trained on RSD, FL trained on clinical labels against central trained on clinical labels, FL trained on RSD against central trained on clinical labels, and FL trained on clinical labels against central trained on RSD (P = 0.046, P = 0.126, P = 0.224, and P = 0.0173, respectively). Four of the 7 (57%) models trained on local institutional data performed inferiorly to the FL models. The model performance for local models was positively correlated with the label agreement (between clinical and RSD labels, CC = 0.389, P = 0.387), total number of plus cases (CC = 0.759, P = 0.047), and overall training set size (CC = 0.924, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a trained FL model performs comparably to a centralized model, confirming that FL may provide an effective, more feasible solution for interinstitutional learning. Smaller institutions benefit more from collaboration than larger institutions, showing the potential of FL for addressing disparities in resource access."

For instance, the COVID-19 scare has reduced timely hospital admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Europe and the USA, causing unnecessary deaths and disabilities. While the emergency is still ongoing, enough efforts have been put to study and tackle this condition such that a comprehensive perspective and synthesis on the potential role of breakthrough healthcare technologies is possible. Indeed, current state-of-the-art information technologies can provide a unique opportunity to adapt and adjust to the current healthcare needs associated with COVID-19, either directly or indirectly, and in particular those of cardiovascular patients and practitioners.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched several biomedical databases, websites and social media, including PubMed, Medscape, and Twitter, for smartcare approaches suitable for application in the COVID-19 pandemic.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We retrieved details on several promising avenues for present and future healthcare technologies, capable of substantially reduce the mortality, morbidity, and resource use burden of COVID-19 as well as that of cardiovascular disease. In particular, we have found data supporting the importance of data sharing, model sharing, preprint archiving, social media, medical case sharing, distance learning and continuous medical education, smartphone apps, telemedicine, robotics, big data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of optimization of individual prevention, diagnosis, tracing, risk-stratification, treatment and rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: We are confident that refinement and command of smartcare technologies will prove extremely beneficial in the short-term, but also dramatically reshape cardiovascular practice and healthcare delivery in the long-term future, for COVID-19 as well as other diseases."

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the ways that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), methodologies can inform patient care during pregnancy and improve outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched English articles on EMBASE, PubMed and SCOPUS. Search terms included ML, AI, pregnancy and informatics. We included research articles and book chapters, excluding conference papers, editorials and notes.
RESULTS: We identified 127 distinct studies from our queries that were relevant to our topic and included in the review. We found that supervised learning methods were more popular (n = 69) than unsupervised methods (n = 9). Popular methods included support vector machines (n = 30), artificial neural networks (n = 22), regression analysis (n = 17) and random forests (n = 16). Methods such as DL are beginning to gain traction (n = 13). Common areas within the pregnancy domain where AI and ML methods were used the most include prenatal care (e.g. fetal anomalies, placental functioning) (n = 73); perinatal care, birth and delivery (n = 20); and preterm birth (n = 13). Efforts to translate AI into clinical care include clinical decision support systems (n = 24) and mobile health applications (n = 9).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that ML and AI methods are being employed to optimize pregnancy outcomes, including modern DL methods (n = 13). Future research should focus on less-studied pregnancy domain areas, including postnatal and postpartum care (n = 2). Also, more work on clinical adoption of AI methods and the ethical implications of such adoption is needed."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate several supervised techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for classification and prediction of mortality, in adult patients hospitalized by emergency services with sepsis diagnosis.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort in three university hospitals in Medellín, Colombia. We included patients >18 years hospitalized for suspected or confirmed infection and any organ dysfunction according to the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment. The outcome variable was hospital mortality and the prediction variables were grouped into those related to the initial clinical treatment and care or to the direct measurement of physiological disturbances. Four supervised classification techniques were analyzed: the C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forest, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Their performance was evaluated by the concordance between the observed and predicted outcomes and by the discrimination according to AUC-ROC.
RESULTS: A total of 2510 patients with a median age of 62 years (IQR = 46-74) and an overall hospital mortality rate of 11.5% (n = 289). The best discrimination was provided by the SVM and ANN using physiological variables, with an AUC-ROC of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.62; 0.76) and AUC-ROC of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.61; 0.76) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning and AI are increasingly used as support tools in clinical medicine. Their performance in a syndrome as complex and heterogeneous as sepsis may be a new horizon in clinical research. SVM and ANN seem promising for improving sepsis classification and prognosis."

Recently, there have been increasing uptakes of Big Data techniques in basic, clinical, and public health fields of HIV/AIDS research. However, no studies have systematically elaborated on the evolving applications of Big Data in HIV/AIDS research. We sought to explore the emergence and evolution of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS-related publications that were funded by the US federal agencies.
METHODS: We identified HIV/AIDS and Big Data related publications that were funded by seven federal agencies from 2000 to 2019 by integrating data from National Institutes of Health (NIH) ExPORTER, MEDLINE, and MeSH. Building on bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we constructed co-occurrence networks using bibliographic metadata (e.g., countries, institutes, MeSH terms, and keywords) of the retrieved publications. We then detected clusters among the networks as well as the temporal dynamics of clusters, followed by expert evaluation and clinical implications.
RESULTS: We harnessed nearly 600 thousand publications related to HIV/AIDS, of which 19,528 publications relating to Big Data were included in bibliometric analysis. Results showed that (1) the number of Big Data publications has been increasing since 2000, (2) US institutes have been in close collaborations with China, Canada, and Germany, (3) some institutes (e.g., University of California system, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Harvard Medical School) are among the most productive institutes and started using Big Data in HIV/AIDS research early, (4) Big Data research was not active in public health disciplines until 2015, (5) research topics such as genomics, HIV comorbidities, population-based studies, Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, precision medicine, and methodologies such as machine learning, Deep Learning, radiomics, and data mining emerge quickly in recent years.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a rapid growth in the cross-disciplinary research of HIV/AIDS and Big Data over the past two decades. Our findings demonstrated patterns and trends of prevailing research topics and Big Data applications in HIV/AIDS research and suggested a number of fast-evolving areas of Big Data Science in HIV/AIDS research including secondary analysis of EHR, machine learning, Deep Learning, predictive analysis, and NLP."

METHODS: A multicenter, prospective patient cohort from the Osteoarthritis Initiative between 2004 and 2015 with full-limb standing radiographs at 12 month follow-up was included. A convolutional neural network was developed to automate measurements of the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, femur, and tibia lengths, and LLD. At 12 month follow-up, patients reported their frequency of knee pain since enrollment and current level of knee pain.
RESULTS: A total of 1011 patients (2022 knees, 52.3% female) with an average age of 61.2 ± 9.0 years were included. The algorithm performed 12,312 measurements in 5.4 h. ICC values of HKA and LLD ranged between 0.87 and 1.00 when compared against trained radiologist measurements. Knees producing pain most days of the month were significantly more varus (mean HKA:- 3.9° ± 2.8°) or valgus (mean HKA:2.8° ± 2.3°) compared to knees that did not produce any pain (p < 0.05). In varus knees, those producing pain on most days were part of the shorter limb compared to nonpainful knees (p < 0.05). Baseline Kellgren-Lawrence grade was significantly associated with HKA magnitude, LLD, and pain frequency at 12 month follow-up (p < 0.05 all).
CONCLUSION: A higher frequency of knee pain was associated with more severe coronal plane deformity, with valgus deviation being one degree less than varus on average, suggesting that the knee tolerates less valgus deformation before symptoms become more consistent. Knee pain frequency was also associated with greater LLD and baseline KL grade, suggesting an association between radiographically apparent joint degeneration and pain frequency.

Dermatologists encountering diagnostically 'unclear' lesions may benefit from artificial intelligence support via convolutional neural networks (CNN).
METHODS: In a web-based classification task, dermatologists (n = 64) diagnosed a convenience sample of 100 FSL as 'benign', 'malignant', or 'unclear' and indicated their management decisions ('no action', 'follow-up', 'treatment/excision'). A market-approved CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro®, FotoFinder Systems, Germany) was applied for binary classifications (benign/malignant) of dermoscopic images.
RESULTS: After reviewing one dermoscopic image per case, dermatologists labelled 562 of 6400 diagnoses (8.8%) as 'unclear' and mostly managed these by follow-up examinations (57.3%, n = 322) or excisions (42.5%, n = 239). Management was incorrect in 58.8% of 291 truly malignant cases (171 'follow-up' or 'no action') and 43.9% of 271 truly benign cases (119 'excision'). Accepting CNN classifications in unclear cases would have reduced false management decisions to 4.1% in truly malignant and 31.7% in truly benign lesions (both p < 0.01). After receiving full case information 239 diagnoses (3.7%) remained 'unclear' to dermatologists, now triggering more excisions (72.0%) than follow-up examinations (28.0%). These management decisions were incorrect in 32.8% of 116 truly malignant cases and 76.4% of 123 truly benign cases. Accepting CNN classifications would have reduced false management decisions to 6.9% in truly malignant lesions and to 38.2% in truly benign cases (both p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Dermatologists mostly managed diagnostically 'unclear' FSL by treatment/excision or follow-up examination. Following CNN classifications as guidance in unclear cases seems suitable to significantly reduce incorrect decisions."

In this study we address the need to provide an accurate patient specific risk prediction for one-year postoperative mortality or cardiac transplantation and prolonged length of hospital stay with the purpose of assisting clinicians and patients' families in the preoperative decision making process. Currently available risk prediction models either do not provide patient specific risk factors or only predict in-hospital mortality rates. We apply machine learning models to predict and calculate individual patient risk for mortality and prolonged length of stay using the Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial dataset. We applied a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulation method to impute missing data and then fed the selected variables to multiple machine learning models. The individual risk of mortality or cardiac transplantation calculation produced by our deep neural network model demonstrated 89 ± 4% accuracy and 0.95 ± 0.02 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The C-statistics results for prediction of prolonged length of stay were 85 ± 3% accuracy and AUROC 0.94 ± 0.04.

Participants were partitioned into nonoverlapping sets of 2407 for algorithm training, 100 for validation and parameter tuning, and 7143 for testing. A deep learning algorithm using convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architectures was trained to classify pattern of emphysema according to Fleischner criteria. Deep learning scores were compared with visual scores and clinical parameters including pulmonary function tests. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate relationships between emphysema scores and survival. The algorithm was also tested by using CT and clinical data in 1962 participants enrolled in the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) study.ResultsA total of 7143 COPDGene participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 59.8 years ± 8.9; 3734 men and 3409 women) were evaluated. Deep learning emphysema classifications were associated with impaired pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk distance, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire at univariate analysis (P &lt; .001 for each). Testing in the ECLIPSE cohort showed similar associations (P &lt; .001). In the COPDGene test cohort, deep learning emphysema classification improved the fit of linear mixed models in the prediction of these clinical parameters compared with visual scoring (P &lt; .001).

However, multi-batch data, as well as extracted radiomic features, exhibit pronounced technical artifacts across batches. These batch effects introduce confounding into the data and can obscure biological effects of interest, decreasing the generalizability and reproducibility of findings. This is especially true when multi-batch data is used alongside complex downstream analysis models, such as machine learning methods. Image harmonization methods seeking to remove these batch effects are important for mitigating these issues; however, significant multivariate batch effects remain in the data following harmonization by current state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods. We present DeepCombat, a deep learning harmonization method based on a conditional variational autoencoder architecture and the ComBat harmonization model. DeepCombat learns and removes subject-level batch effects by accounting for the multivariate relationships between features. Additionally, DeepComBat relaxes a number of strong assumptions commonly made by previous deep learning harmonization methods and is empirically robust across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. We apply this method to neuroimaging data from a large cognitive-aging cohort and find that DeepCombat outperforms existing methods, as assessed by a battery of machine learning methods, in removing scanner effects from cortical thickness measurements while preserving biological heterogeneity. Additionally, DeepComBat provides a new perspective for statistically-motivated deep learning harmonization methods."

Performance of such models is often affected by potential variabilities stemming from independent protocols for data generation, imaging equipment, radiology artifacts, and demographic distributional shifts. Domain generalization (DG) frameworks have the potential to overcome these issues by learning signal from one or more source domains that can be transferable to unseen target domains. We developed an approach that leverages model interpretability as a means to improve generalizability of classification models across multiple cohorts. Using MRI scans and clinical diagnosis obtained from four independent cohorts (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, n = 1,821), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n = 304), the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 661), and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 4,647)), we trained a deep neural network that used model-identified regions of disease relevance to inform model training. We trained a classifier to distinguish persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by aligning class-wise attention with a unified visual saliency prior computed offline per class over all training data. Our proposed method competes with state-of-the-art methods with improved correlation with postmortem histology, thus grounding our findings with gold standard evidence and paving a way towards validating DG frameworks."

Particularly, it holds significant value for patients who require long-term monitoring or with underlying cardiovascular disease. To this end, Visual Contactless Physiological Monitoring (VCPM) is capable of using videos recorded by a consumer camera to monitor blood volume pulse (BVP) signal, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and blood pressure (BP). Recently, deep learning-based pipelines have attracted numerous scholars and achieved unprecedented development. Although VCPM is still an emerging digital medical technology and presents many challenges and opportunities, it has the potential to revolutionize clinical medicine, digital health, telemedicine as well as other areas. The VCPM technology presents a viable solution that can be integrated into these systems for measuring vital parameters during video consultation, owing to its merits of contactless measurement, cost-effectiveness, user-friendly passive monitoring and the sole requirement of an off-the-shelf camera. In fact, the studies of VCPM technologies have been rocketing recently, particularly AI-based approaches, but few are employed in clinical settings. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the applications, challenges, and prospects of VCPM from the perspective of clinical settings and AI technologies for the first time. The thorough exploration and analysis of clinical scenarios will provide profound guidance for the research and development of VCPM technologies in clinical settings."

We aimed to assess cancer detection accuracy of an AI system in a Danish screening population.
METHODS: We retrieved a consecutive screening cohort from the Region of Southern Denmark including all participating women between Aug 4, 2014, and August 15, 2018. Screening mammograms were processed by a commercial AI system and detection accuracy was evaluated in two scenarios, Standalone AI and AI-integrated screening replacing first reader, with first reader and double reading with arbitration (combined reading) as comparators, respectively. Two AI-score cut-off points were applied by matching at mean first reader sensitivity (AI<sub>sens</sub>) and specificity (AI<sub>spec</sub>). Reference standard was histopathology-proven breast cancer or cancer-free follow-up within 24 months. Coprimary endpoints were sensitivity and specificity, and secondary endpoints were positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), recall rate, and arbitration rate. Accuracy estimates were calculated using McNemar's test or exact binomial test.
RESULTS: Out of 272,008 screening mammograms from 158,732 women, 257,671 (94.7%) with adequate image data were included in the final analyses. Sensitivity and specificity were 63.7% (95% CI 61.6%-65.8%) and 97.8% (97.7-97.8%) for first reader, and 73.9% (72.0-75.8%) and 97.9% (97.9-98.0%) for combined reading, respectively. Standalone AI<sub>sens</sub> showed a lower specificity (-1.3%) and PPV (-6.1%), and a higher recall rate (+ 1.3%) compared to first reader (p &lt; 0.0001 for all), while Standalone AI<sub>spec</sub> had a lower sensitivity (-5.1%; p &lt; 0.0001), PPV (-1.3%; p = 0.01) and NPV (-0.04%; p = 0.0002). Compared to combined reading, Integrated AI<sub>sens</sub> achieved higher sensitivity (+ 2.3%; p = 0.0004), but lower specificity (-0.6%) and PPV (-3.9%) as well as higher recall rate (+ 0.6%) and arbitration rate (+ 2.2%; p &lt; 0.0001 for all). Integrated AI<sub>spec</sub> showed no significant difference in any outcome measures apart from a slightly higher arbitration rate (p &lt; 0.0001). Subgroup analyses showed higher detection of interval cancers by Standalone AI and Integrated AI at both thresholds (p &lt; 0.0001 for all) with a varying composition of detected cancers across multiple subgroups of tumour characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing first reader in double reading with an AI could be feasible but choosing an appropriate AI threshold is crucial to maintaining cancer detection accuracy and workload."

Epub 2022 May 12.,Lopez-Almazan H,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2022,2022/05/20,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106885,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Breast density assessed from digital mammograms is a biomarker for higher risk of developing breast cancer. Experienced radiologists assess breast density using the Breast Image and Data System (BI-RADS) categories. Supervised learning algorithms have been developed with this objective in mind, however, the performance of these algorithms depends on the quality of the ground-truth information which is usually labeled by expert readers. These labels are noisy approximations of the ground truth, as there is often intra- and inter-reader variability among labels. Thus, it is crucial to provide a reliable method to obtain digital mammograms matching BI-RADS categories. This paper presents RegL (Labels Regularizer), a methodology that includes different image pre-processes to allow both a correct breast segmentation and the enhancement of image quality through an intensity adjustment, thus allowing the use of deep learning to classify the mammograms into BI-RADS categories. The Confusion Matrix (CM) - CNN network used implements an architecture that models each radiologist's noisy label. The final methodology pipeline was determined after comparing the performance of image pre-processes combined with different DL architectures.
METHODS: A multi-center study composed of 1395 women whose mammograms were classified into the four BI-RADS categories by three experienced radiologists is presented. A total of 892 mammograms were used as the training corpus, 224 formed the validation corpus, and 279 the test corpus.
RESULTS: The combination of five networks implementing the RegL methodology achieved the best results among all the models in the test set. The ensemble model obtained an accuracy of (0.85) and a kappa index of 0.71.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methodology has a similar performance to the experienced radiologists in the classification of digital mammograms into BI-RADS categories. This suggests that the pre-processing steps and modelling of each radiologist's label allows for a better estimation of the unknown ground truth labels."

METHODS: We developed a robust deep-learning framework for kidney (sub-)segmentation based on a hierarchical, three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) that was optimized for multiscale problems of combined localization and segmentation. We applied the CNN to abdominal magnetic resonance images from the population-based German National Cohort (NAKO) study.
RESULTS: There was good to excellent agreement between the model predictions and manual segmentations. The median values for the body-surface normalized total kidney, cortex, medulla, and sinus volumes of 9934 persons were 158, 115, 43, and 24 mL/m2. Distributions of these markers are provided both for the overall study population and for a subgroup of persons without kidney disease or any associated conditions. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses revealed that diabetes, male sex, and a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are important predictors of higher total and cortical volumes. Each increase of eGFR by one unit (i.e., 1 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area) was associated with a 0.98 mL/m2 increase in total kidney volume, and this association was significant. Volumes were lower in persons with eGFR-defined chronic kidney disease.
CONCLUSION: The extraction of image-based biomarkers through CNN-based renal sub-segmentation using data from a population-based study yields reliable results, forming a solid foundation for future investigations."

This fact illustrates the strong potential for artificial intelligence (AI) implementation in dentistry, which makes awareness and attitude toward AI an important indicator for the future of this technology in the field. Hence, this scoping review aimed to report the status of awareness and attitude toward AI in dentistry.
METHODOLOGY: To ensure the quality and transparency of the present review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart is reported. Four databases were searched for related topics (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Google Scholar, and Scopus); 1,430 studies were identified, and after screening and filtering, 21 cross-sectional studies were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-one cross-sectional studies were included and yielded 7,688 participants. With an average level of 50.31% among all the studies that reported awareness (18 studies). Four subgroups' average levels of awareness toward AI in dentistry were reported: 67.16% among dentists, 42.58% among dental students, 45.56% for studies conducted on both dentists and dental students, and 69.53% for studies reporting awareness of AI in oral radiology. Regarding attitude, out of 13 studies, an average level of 44.13% felt threatened or thought AI would replace them.
CONCLUSION: The average level of awareness is in accordance with the attitude toward AI in dentistry. The low levels of awareness are important indicators of the gap formed between the inevitable application of AI and the lack of utilization in the dental field. AI implementation in dental schools' curricula is required since the lowest reported level among subgroups was among dental students."

The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) recently published a review that examined the viability, effectiveness and appropriateness of a population-based screening programme for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). In our article, we summarise the results of the review and discuss some future directions that may enable effective population screening for glaucoma in the future. Two key questions were addressed by the UK NSC review; is there a valid, accurate screening test for POAG, and does evidence exist that screening reduces morbidity from POAG compared with standard care. Six new studies were identified since the previous 2015 review. The review concluded that screening for glaucoma in adults is not recommended because there is no clear evidence for a sufficiently accurate screening test or for better outcomes with screening compared to current care. The next UK NSC review is due to be conducted in 2023. One challenge for POAG screening is that the relatively low disease prevalence results in too many false-positive referrals, even with an accurate test. In the future, targeted screening of a population subset with a higher prevalence of glaucoma may be effective. Recent developments in POAG polygenic risk prediction and deep learning image analysis offer potential avenues to identifying glaucoma-enriched sub-populations. Until such time, opportunistic case finding through General Ophthalmic Services remains the primary route for identification of glaucoma in the UK and greater public awareness of the service would be of benefit."

METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective diagnostic study, gastric imaging data were added to the deep learning-based SmartScan (SS), which has been described previously. A total of 1069 magnetically controlled GI CE examinations (comprising 2,672,542 gastric images) were used in the training phase for recognizing gastric pathologies, producing a new artificial intelligence algorithm named SS Plus. A total of 342 fully automated, magnetically controlled CE examinations were included in the validation phase. The performance of both senior and junior endoscopists with both the SS Plus-assisted reading (SSP-AR) and conventional reading (CR) modes was assessed.
RESULTS: SS Plus was designed to recognize 5 types of gastric lesions and 17 types of SB lesions. SS Plus reduced the number of CE images required for review to 873.90 (median, 1000; interquartile range [IQR], 814.50-1000) versus 44,322.73 (median, 42,393; IQR, 31,722.75-54,971.25) for CR. Furthermore, with SSP-AR, endoscopists took 9.54 minutes (median, 8.51; IQR, 6.05-13.13) to complete the CE video reading. In the 342 CE videos, SS Plus identified 411 gastric and 422 SB lesions, whereas 400 gastric and 368 intestinal lesions were detected with CR. Moreover, junior endoscopists remarkably improved their CE image reading ability with SSP-AR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the newly upgraded deep learning-based algorithm SS Plus can detect GI lesions and help improve the diagnostic performance of junior endoscopists in interpreting CE videos."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this systematic review, the PubMed database was searched for peer-reviewed studies of DL algorithms for image-based radiologic diagnosis that included external validation, published from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2021. Studies using nonimaging features or incorporating non-DL methods for feature extraction or classification were excluded. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Internal and external performance measures and pertinent study characteristics were extracted, and relationships among these data were examined using nonparametric statistics.
RESULTS: Eighty-three studies reporting 86 algorithms were included. The vast majority (70 of 86, 81%) reported at least some decrease in external performance compared with internal performance, with nearly half (42 of 86, 49%) reporting at least a modest decrease (≥0.05 on the unit scale) and nearly a quarter (21 of 86, 24%) reporting a substantial decrease (≥0.10 on the unit scale). No study characteristics were found to be associated with the difference between internal and external performance.
CONCLUSION: Among published external validation studies of DL algorithms for image-based radiologic diagnosis, the vast majority demonstrated diminished algorithm performance on the external dataset, with some reporting a substantial performance decrease.Keywords: Meta-Analysis, Computer Applications-Detection/Diagnosis, Neural Networks, Computer Applications-General (Informatics), Epidemiology, Technology Assessment, Diagnosis, Informatics Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022."

QUS multi-parametric images of breast tumors were generated using the data acquired from 181 patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer and planned for NAC followed by surgery. The ground truth response to NAC was identified for each patient after the surgery using the standard clinical and pathological criteria. Two deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architectures including the residual network and residual attention network (RAN) were explored for extracting optimal feature maps from the parametric images, with a fully connected network for response prediction. In different experiments, the features maps were derived from the tumor core only, as well as the core and its margin. Evaluation results on an independent test set demonstrate that the developed model with the RAN architecture to extract feature maps from the expanded parametric images of the tumor core and margin had the best performance in response prediction with an accuracy of 88% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86. Ten-year survival analyses indicate statistically significant differences between the survival of the responders and non-responders identified based on the model prediction at pre-treatment and the standard criteria at post-treatment. The results of this study demonstrate the promising capability of DCNNs with attention mechanisms in predicting breast cancer response to NAC prior to the start of treatment using QUS multi-parametric images."

Both physicians and nonphysicians are recruited for screening DR. Although there is no standardization of the course syllabus for the capacity building, it is generally accepted to keep their sensitivity >80%, specificity >95%, and clinical failure rate <5% for the nonophthalmologists, if possible. A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the following search terms: diabetic retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy screening, Asia, diabetic retinopathy treatment, age-related macular degeneration, capacity building, deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), nurse-led clinic, and intravitreal injection (IVI). AI may be a tool for improving their capacity. Capacity building on IVIs of antivascular endothelial growth factors for DR is focused on nurses. There is evidence that, after a supervision of an average of 100 initial injections, the trained nurses can do the injections effectively and safely, the rate of endophthalmitis ranges from 0.03 to 0.07%, comparable to ophthalmologists. However, laws and regulations, which are different among countries, are challenges and barriers for nonophthalmologists, particularly for nonphysicians, for both screening and treatment of DR. Even if nonphysicians or physicians who are nonophthalmologists are legally approved for these tasks, sustainability of the capacity is another important challenge, this may be achieved if the capacity building can be part of their career development. Patient acceptability is another important barrier for initiating care provided by nonophthalmologists, particularly in Asia. There are also collaborations between national eye institutes of high-income countries, nongovernment organizations, and local eye institutes to improve both the quality and quantity of ophthalmologists and retinal specialists in low-income countries in Asia. This approach may require more labor, cost, and time consuming than training nonophthalmologists."

Acquiring these images has become a routine task; however, analyzing them is now the bottleneck, as manual structure identification is very time-consuming and can take up to several months for a single sample. Deep learning approaches offer a suitable solution to speed up the analysis. In this work, we present a study of several state-of-the-art deep learning models for the task of segmenting nuclei and nucleoli in volumes from tumor biopsies. We compared previous results obtained with the ResUNet architecture to the more recent UNet++, FracTALResNet, SenFormer, and CEECNet models. In addition, we explored the utilization of unlabeled images through semi-supervised learning with Cross Pseudo Supervision. We have trained and evaluated all of the models on sparse manual labels from three fully annotated in-house datasets that we have made available on demand, demonstrating improvements in terms of 3D Dice score. From the analysis of these results, we drew conclusions on the relative gains of using more complex models, semi-supervised learning as well as next steps for the mitigation of the manual segmentation bottleneck."

AI can serve as a solution for the myopia pandemic, with application potential in early identification, risk stratification, progression prediction, and timely intervention. The datasets used for developing AI models are the foundation and determine the upper limit of performance. Data generated from clinical practice in managing myopia can be categorized into clinical data and imaging data, and different AI methods can be used for analysis. In this review, we comprehensively review the current application status of AI in myopia with an emphasis on data modalities used for developing AI models. We propose that establishing large public datasets with high quality, enhancing the model's capability of handling multimodal input, and exploring novel data modalities could be of great significance for the further application of AI for myopia."

Deep learning can provide automated quantification of coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. We determined per-patient age- and sex-specific distributions of deep learning-based plaque measurements and further evaluated their risk prediction for myocardial infarction in external samples.
METHODS: In this international, multicenter study of 2803 patients, a previously validated deep learning system was used to quantify coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. Age- and sex-specific distributions of coronary plaque volume were determined from 956 patients undergoing computed tomography angiography for stable coronary artery disease from 5 cohorts. Multicenter external samples were used to evaluate associations between coronary plaque percentiles and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: Quantitative deep learning plaque volumes increased with age and were higher in male patients. In the combined external sample (n=1847), patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume (unadjusted hazard ratio, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.47-4.78]; P=0.001) were at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with patients below the 50th percentile. Similar relationships were seen for most plaque volumes and persisted in multivariable analyses adjusting for clinical characteristics, coronary artery calcium, stenosis, and plaque volume, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 2.38 to 2.50 for patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Per-patient age- and sex-specific distributions for deep learning-based coronary plaque volumes are strongly predictive of myocardial infarction, with the highest risk seen in patients with coronary plaque volumes in the ≥75th percentile."

In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record-including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers-to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms-Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB)-and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90±0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93±0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77±0.04 and average ROC-AUC 0.81±0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse."

Health care professionals face challenges in identifying patients who may benefit from palliative care.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep learning algorithm using longitudinal electronic health records to predict mortality risk as a proxy indicator for identifying patients with dementia who may benefit from palliative care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year mortality prediction models with recurrent neural networks used patient demographic information and topics generated from clinical notes within Partners HealthCare System, an integrated health care delivery system in Boston, Massachusetts. This study included 26 921 adult patients with dementia who visited the health care system from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2017. The models were trained using a data set of 24 229 patients and validated using another data set of 2692 patients. Data were analyzed from September 18, 2018, to May 15, 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 6-month and 1- and 2-year mortality prediction models and the factors contributing to the predictions.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 26 921 patients (16 263 women [60.4%]; mean [SD] age, 74.6 [13.5] years). For the 24 229 patients in the training data set, mean (SD) age was 74.8 (13.2) years and 14 632 (60.4%) were women. For the 2692 patients in the validation data set, mean (SD) age was 75.0 (12.6) years and 1631 (60.6%) were women. The 6-month model reached an AUC of 0.978 (95% CI, 0.977-0.978); the 1-year model, 0.956 (95% CI, 0.955-0.956); and the 2-year model, 0.943 (95% CI, 0.942-0.944). The top-ranked latent topics associated with 6-month and 1- and 2-year mortality in patients with dementia include palliative and end-of-life care, cognitive function, delirium, testing of cholesterol levels, cancer, pain, use of health care services, arthritis, nutritional status, skin care, family meeting, shock, respiratory failure, and swallowing function.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A deep learning algorithm based on patient demographic information and longitudinal clinical notes appeared to show promising results in predicting mortality among patients with dementia in different time frames. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in clinical settings for identifying unmet palliative care needs earlier."

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and the most frequent end point of CKD. There is an urgent need for more precise methods to identify patients at risk of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Alterations in microvascular structure and function contribute to the development of hypertension, diabetes, CKD, and their associated cardiovascular disease. Homology between the eye and the kidney suggests that noninvasive imaging of the retinal vessels can detect these microvascular alterations to improve targeting of at-risk patients. Retinal vessel-derived metrics predict incident hypertension, diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease and add to the current renal and cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The advent of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has transformed retinal imaging by capturing the chorioretinal microcirculation and its dependent tissue with near-histological resolution. In hypertension, diabetes, and CKD, OCT has revealed vessel remodeling and chorioretinal thinning. Clinical and preclinical OCT has linked retinal microvascular pathology to circulating and histological markers of injury in the kidney. The advent of OCT angiography allows contrast-free visualization of intraretinal capillary networks to potentially detect early incipient microvascular disease. Combining OCT's deep imaging with the analytical power of deep learning represents the next frontier in defining what the eye can reveal about the kidney and broader cardiovascular health."

RESULTS: The ECG-Age showed a high correlation with chronological age in both the internal and external validation datasets (Pearson's R = 0.888 and 0.852, respectively). In the internal validation, the direct mortality risk prediction models showed area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.843 and 0.867 for 5- and 1-year all-cause mortality, respectively. For 5- and 1-year cardiovascular mortality, the AUCs were 0.920 and 0.916, respectively. In the CODE-15%, the mortality risk predictions showed AUCs of 0.818 and 0.836 for the prediction of 5- and 1-year all-cause mortality, respectively. Compared to the neutral Delta-Age (ECG-Age - chronological age) group, hazard ratios for deaths were 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-3.92], 2.12 (95% CI: 1.15-3.92), 4.46 (95% CI: 2.22-8.96) and 7.68 (95% CI: 3.32-17.76) for positive Delta-Age groups (5-10, 10-15, 15-20, >20), respectively.
CONCLUSION: An image-based AI-ECG model is a feasible tool for estimating biological age and assessing all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risks, providing a practical approach for utilizing standardized ECG images in predicting long-term health outcomes."

However, reading CT films brings a lot of concentration and time for doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automatic CT image diagnosis system to assist doctors in diagnosis. Previous studies devoted to COVID-19 in the past months focused mostly on discriminating COVID-19 infected patients from healthy persons and/or bacterial pneumonia patients, and have ignored typical viral pneumonia since it is hard to collect samples for viral pneumonia that is less frequent in adults. In addition, it is much more challenging to discriminate COVID-19 from typical viral pneumonia as COVID-19 is also a kind of virus. In this study, we have collected CT images of 262, 100, 219, and 78 persons for COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, typical viral pneumonia, and healthy controls, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of quaternary classification to include also typical viral pneumonia. To effectively capture the subtle differences in CT images, we have constructed a new model by combining the ResNet50 backbone with SE blocks that was recently developed for fine image analysis. Our model was shown to outperform commonly used baseline models, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.94 with AUC of 0.96, recall of 0.94, precision of 0.95, and F1-score of 0.94.

These steps are essential for transforming genetic information in DNA into proteins and contribute to RNA diversity and complexity. Many biochemical methods have been developed to profile and quantify RNAs, as well as to identify the interactions between RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), especially when coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies. With the rapid accumulation of diverse data, it is crucial to develop computational methods to convert the big data into biological knowledge. In particular, machine learning and deep learning models are commonly utilized to learn the rules or codes governing the transformation from DNA sequences to intriguing RNAs based on manually designed or automatically extracted features. When precise enough, the RNA codes can be incredibly useful for predicting RNA products, decoding the molecular mechanisms, forecasting the impact of disease variants on RNA processing events, and identifying driver mutations. In this review, we systematically summarize the biochemical and computational methods for deciphering five important RNA codes related to alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, RNA localization, RNA modifications, and RBP binding. For each code, we review the main types of experimental methods used to generate training data, as well as the key features, strategic model structures, and advantages of representative tools. We also discuss the challenges encountered in developing predictive models using large language models and extensive domain knowledge. Additionally, we highlight useful resources and propose ways to improve computational tools for studying RNA codes."

Accurate survival analysis is urgently needed for better disease diagnosis and treatment management.
RESULTS: In this work, we propose a survival analysis system that takes advantage of recently emerging deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of three major components. 1) The first component is an end-to-end cellular feature learning module using a deep neural network with global average pooling. The learned cellular representations encode high-level biologically relevant information without requiring individual cell segmentation, which is aggregated into patient-level feature vectors by using a locality-constrained linear coding (LLC)-based bag of words (BoW) encoding algorithm. 2) The second component is a Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic net penalty for robust feature selection and survival analysis. 3) The third commponent is a biomarker interpretation module that can help localize the image regions that contribute to the survival model's decision. Extensive experiments show that the proposed survival model has excellent predictive power for a public (i.e., The Cancer Genome Atlas) lung cancer dataset in terms of two commonly used metrics: log-rank test (p-value) of the Kaplan-Meier estimate and concordance index (c-index).
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we have proposed a segmentation-free survival analysis system that takes advantage of the recently emerging deep learning framework and well-studied survival analysis methods such as the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, we provide an approach to visualize the discovered biomarkers, which can serve as concrete evidence supporting the survival model's decision."

Not surprisingly, HCV infection is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. After sustained virological response (SVR), the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is not completely eliminated in patients with established cirrhosis or with advanced fibrosis. Therefore, lifelong surveillance is currently recommended. This strategy is likely not universally cost-effective and harmless, considering that not all patients with advanced fibrosis have the same risk of developing HCC. Factors related to the severity of liver disease and its potential to improve after SVR, the molecular and epigenetic changes that occur during infection and other associated comorbidities might account for different risk levels and are likely essential for identifying patients who would benefit from screening programs after SVR. Efforts to develop predictive models and risk calculators, biomarkers and genetic panels and even deep learning models to estimate the individual risk of HCC have been made in the direct-acting antiviral agents era, when thousands of patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis have reached SVR. These tools could help to identify patients with very low HCC risk in whom surveillance might not be justified. In this review, factors affecting the probability of HCC development after SVR, the benefits and risks of surveillance, suggested strategies to estimate individualized HCC risk and the current evidence to recommend lifelong surveillance are discussed."

Understanding the role of risk factors is significant for developing a strategy to improve global health. There is strong evidence that risk factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, previous cataract surgery, age, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, BMI, female gender, and focal hyper-pigmentation are independently associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Currently, in the literature, statistical techniques like logistic regression, multivariable logistic regression, etc., are being used to identify AMD risk factors by employing numerical/categorical data. However, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have not been used so far in the literature for identifying risk factors for AMD. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) based tools can anticipate when a person is at risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer, dementia, asthma, etc., in providing personalized care. AI-based techniques can employ numerical/categorical and/or image data thus resulting in multimodal data analysis, which provides the need for AI-based tools to be used for risk factor analysis in ophthalmology. This review summarizes the statistical techniques used to identify various risk factors and the higher benefits that AI techniques provide for AMD-related disease prediction. Additional studies are required to review different techniques for risk factor identification for other ophthalmic diseases like glaucoma, diabetic macular edema, retinopathy of prematurity, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy."

Current lung cancer screening protocols primarily evaluate pulmonary nodules, yet often neglect the malignancy risk associated with small nodules (≤10 mm). This study endeavors to optimize the management of pulmonary nodules in this population by devising and externally validating a Multimodal Integrated Feature Neural Network (MIFNN). We hypothesize that the fusion of deep learning algorithms with morphological nodule features will significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy.Materials and Methods. Data were retrospectively collected from the Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) dataset and four local centers in Beijing, China. The study includes patients with small pulmonary nodules (≤10 mm). We developed a neural network, termed MIFNN, that synergistically combines computed tomography (CT) images and morphological characteristics of pulmonary nodules. The network is designed to acquire clinically relevant deep learning features, thereby elevating the diagnostic accuracy of existing models. Importantly, the network's simple architecture and use of standard screening variables enable seamless integration into standard lung cancer screening protocols.Results. In summary, the study analyzed a total of 382 small pulmonary nodules (85 malignant) from the LUNA16 dataset and 101 small pulmonary nodules (33 malignant) obtained from four specialized centers in Beijing, China, for model training and external validation. Both internal and external validation metrics indicate that the MIFNN significantly surpasses extant state-of-the-art models, achieving an internal area under the curve (AUC) of 0.890 (95% CI: 0.848-0.932) and an external AUC of 0.843 (95% CI: 0.784-0.891).Conclusion. The MIFNN model significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy of small pulmonary nodules, outperforming existing benchmarks by Zhanget alwith a 6.34% improvement for nodules less than 10 mm. Leveraging advanced integration techniques for imaging and clinical data, MIFNN increases the efficiency of lung cancer screenings and optimizes nodule management, potentially reducing false positives and unnecessary biopsies.Clinical relevance statement. The MIFNN enhances lung cancer screening efficiency and patient management for small pulmonary nodules, while seamlessly integrating into existing workflows due to its reliance on standard screening variables."

DESIGN: European, multicenter cohort study.
SUBJECTS: Overall, 301 eyes of 301 subjects with early (n = 34), intermediate (n = 168), and late AMD (n = 43), as well as eyes without any AMD features (n = 56).
METHODS: In study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the presence of structural AMD biomarkers, including pigmentary abnormalities (PAs), pigment epithelium detachment (PED), refractile deposits, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and quiescent choroidal neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically determined in the prospectively acquired multimodal retinal imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal layer thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were determined for the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD) OCT imaging using a deep-learning-based algorithm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and topographic distribution of structural iAMD features.
RESULTS: A total of 301 study eyes of 301 subjects with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 71.2 ± 7.20 years (63.1% women) were included. Besides large drusen, the most prevalent structural feature in iAMD study eyes were PA (57.1%), followed by HRF (51.8%) and RPD (22.0%). Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were observed in 4.8%, vitelliform lesions in 4.2%, refractile deposits in 3.0%, and qCNV in 2.4%. Direct precursor lesions for manifest retinal atrophy were detected in 10.7% (iRORA) and 4.2% (cRORA) in iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume with a median of 98.92 × 10-4 mm³ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial analysis demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the superior and temporal subfields at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5 to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct topographic distribution involving the foveal center.
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD biomarkers is vital to identify reliable outcome measure for disease progression. Longitudinal analyses are needed to evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced disease stages.

Epub 2020 Mar 17.,Rim TH,Ophthalmol Retina,2020,2020/05/05,,,10.1016/j.oret.2020.03.007,"PURPOSE: Though the domain of big data and artificial intelligence in health care continues to evolve, there is a lack of systemic methods to improve data quality and streamline the preparation process. To address this, we aimed to develop an automated sorting system (RetiSort) that accurately labels the type and laterality of retinal photographs.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PARTICIPANTS: RetiSort was developed with retinal photographs from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study.
METHODS: The development of RetiSort was composed of 3 steps: 2 deep-learning (DL) algorithms and 1 rule-based classifier. For step 1, a DL algorithm was developed to locate the optic disc, the ""landmark feature."" For step 2, based on the location of the optic disc derived from step 1, a rule-based classifier was developed to sort retinal photographs into 3 types: macular-centered, optic disc-centered, or related to other fields. Step 2 concurrently distinguished laterality (i.e., the left or right eye) of macular-centered photographs. For step 3, an additional DL algorithm was developed to differentiate the laterality of disc-centered photographs. Via the 3 steps, RetiSort sorted and labeled retinal images into (1) right macular-centered, (2) left macular-centered, (3) right optic disc-centered, (4) left optic disc-centered, and (5) images relating to other fields. Subsequently, the accuracy of RetiSort was evaluated on 5000 randomly selected retinal images from SEED as well as on 3 publicly available image databases (DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS). The main outcome measure was the accuracy for sorting of retinal photographs.
RESULTS: RetiSort mislabeled 48 out of 5000 retinal images from SEED, representing an overall accuracy of 99.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 98.7-99.3). In external tests, RetiSort mislabeled 1, 0, and 2 images, respectively, from DIARETDB0, HEI-MED, and Drishti-GS, representing an accuracy of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.8-99.9), 100%, and 98.0% (95% CI, 93.1-99.8), respectively. Saliency maps consistently showed that the DL algorithm in step 3 required pixels in the central left lateral border and optic disc of optic disc-centered retinal photographs to differentiate the laterality.
CONCLUSIONS: RetiSort is a highly accurate automated sorting system. It can aid in data preparation and has practical applications in DL research that uses retinal photographs."

This study explores deep learning applications in medical imaging allowing for the automated quantification of radiographic characteristics and potentially improving patient stratification.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed an integrative analysis on 7 independent datasets across 5 institutions totaling 1,194 NSCLC patients (age median = 68.3 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.7 years [range 0.0-11.7]). Using external validation in computed tomography (CT) data, we identified prognostic signatures using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for patients treated with radiotherapy (n = 771, age median = 68.0 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.3 years [range 0.0-11.7]). We then employed a transfer learning approach to achieve the same for surgery patients (n = 391, age median = 69.1 years [range 37.2-88.0], survival median = 3.1 years [range 0.0-8.8]). We found that the CNN predictions were significantly associated with 2-year overall survival from the start of respective treatment for radiotherapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70 [95% CI 0.63-0.78], p < 0.001) and surgery (AUC = 0.71 [95% CI 0.60-0.82], p < 0.001) patients. The CNN was also able to significantly stratify patients into low and high mortality risk groups in both the radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and surgery (p = 0.03) datasets. Additionally, the CNN was found to significantly outperform random forest models built on clinical parameters-including age, sex, and tumor node metastasis stage-as well as demonstrate high robustness against test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91) and inter-reader (Spearman's rank-order correlation = 0.88) variations. To gain a better understanding of the characteristics captured by the CNN, we identified regions with the most contribution towards predictions and highlighted the importance of tumor-surrounding tissue in patient stratification. We also present preliminary findings on the biological basis of the captured phenotypes as being linked to cell cycle and transcriptional processes. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study as well as the opaque black box nature of deep learning networks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that deep learning networks may be used for mortality risk stratification based on standard-of-care CT images from NSCLC patients. This evidence motivates future research into better deciphering the clinical and biological basis of deep learning networks as well as validation in prospective data."

In this study we sought to survey the landscape of externally validated DL-based computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) models, and assess their diagnostic performance for predicting the risk of malignancy in computed tomography (CT)-detected pulmonary nodules.
METHODS: An electronic search was performed in four databases (from inception to 10 August 2023). Studies were eligible if they were peer-reviewed experimental or observational articles comparing the diagnostic performance of externally validated DL-based CADx models with models widely used in clinical practice to predict the risk of malignancy. A bivariate random-effect approach for the meta-analysis on the included studies was used.
RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, comprising 8553 participants and 9884 nodules. Pooled analyses showed DL-based CADx models were 11.6% more sensitive than physician judgement alone, and 14.5% more than clinical risk models alone. They had a similar pooled specificity to physician judgement alone [0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) v 0.81 (95% CI 0.71-0.88)], and were 7.4% more specific than clinical risk models alone. They had superior pooled areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC), with relative pooled AUCs of 1.03 (95% CI 1.00-1.07) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.07-1.13) versus physician judgement and clinical risk models alone, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DL-based models are already used in clinical practice in certain settings for nodule management. Our results show their diagnostic performance potentially justifies wider, more routine deployment alongside experienced physician readers to help inform multidisciplinary team decision-making."

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to familiarize the reader with the remote technologies that have been developed and used in DM education over the past 20 years.
LITERATURE SCOPING REVIEWS: Mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, deep learning (DL), and visual reality stimulation, e.g., head-mounted display (HMD), are selected as promising and inspiring designs in DM education.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on the remote technologies applied in DM pedagogy for medical, nursing, and social work, as well as other health discipline students, e.g., paramedics. Databases including PubMed (MEDLINE), ISI Web of Science (WOS), EBSCO (EBSCO Essentials), Embase (EMB), and Scopus were used. The sourced results were recorded in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart and followed in accordance with the PRISMA extension Scoping Review checklist. We included peer-reviewed articles, Epubs (electronic publications such as databases), and proceedings written in English. VOSviewer for related keywords extracted from review articles presented as a tabular summary to demonstrate their occurrence and connections among these DM education articles from 2000 to 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 1,080 research articles on remote technologies in DM were initially reviewed. After exclusion, 64 articles were included in our review. Emergency remote teaching/learning education, remote learning, online learning/teaching, and blended learning are the most frequently used keywords. As new remote technologies used in emergencies become more advanced, DM pedagogy is facing more complex problems.
DISCUSSIONS: Artificial intelligence-enhanced remote technologies promote learning incentives for medical undergraduate students or graduate professionals, but the efficacy of learning quality remains uncertain. More blended AI-modulating pedagogies in DM education could be increasingly important in the future. More sophisticated evaluation and assessment are needed to implement carefully considered designs for effective DM education."

This study aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning-based out-of-hospital cardiac arrest prognostic system (DCAPS) for predicting neurologic recovery and survival to discharge.
METHODS: The study subjects were patients from the Korea OHCA registry who experienced return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA. A total of 36,190 patients were exclusively divided into a set of 28,045 subjects for derivation data and 8,145 subjects for validation data. We used information available for the time of ROSC as predictor variables, and the endpoints were neurologic recovery (cerebral performance category 1 or 2) and survival to discharge. The DCAPS was developed using the derivation data and represented the favorability of prognosis with a score between 0 and 100.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of DCAPS for predicting neurologic recovery for the validation data was 0.953 [95% confidence interval 0.952-0.954]; these results significantly outperformed those of logistic regression (0.947 [0.943-0.948]), random forest (0.943 [0.942-0.945]), support vector machine (0.930 [0.929-0.932]), and conventional methods of a previous study (0.817 [0.815-0.820]). The AUROC of the DCAPS for survival to discharge was 0.901 [0.900-0.903], and this result significantly outperformed those of other models as well.
CONCLUSIONS: The DCAPS predicted neurologic recovery and survival to discharge of OHCA patients accurately and outperformed the conventional method and other machine-learning methods."

Understanding the underlying mechanisms and improving identification of people with a higher risk profile of systemic vascular disease through noninvasive examinations is crucial. In ophthalmology, retinal vascular network imaging is simple and noninvasive and can provide in vivo information of the microstructure and vascular health. For more than 10 years, different research teams have been working on developing software to enable automatic analysis of the retinal vascular network from different imaging techniques (retinal fundus photographs, OCT angiography, adaptive optics, etc.) and to provide a description of the geometric characteristics of its arterial and venous components. Thus, the structure of retinal vessels could be considered a witness of the systemic vascular status. A new approach called ""oculomics"" using retinal image datasets and artificial intelligence algorithms recently increased the interest in retinal microvascular biomarkers. Despite the large volume of associated research, the role of retinal biomarkers in the screening, monitoring, or prediction of systemic vascular disease remains uncertain. A PubMed search was conducted until August 2022 and yielded relevant peer-reviewed articles based on a set of inclusion criteria. This literature review is intended to summarize the state of the art in oculomics and cardiovascular disease research."

On the other hand, recent advances in deep learning and transfer learning have shown significant potential in the quantitative medical imaging field, raising the research question of whether deep transfer learning features have predictive information in addition to radiomics features. In this study, using CT images from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients recruited in two independent hospitals, we discovered most transfer learning features have weak linear relationships with radiomics features, suggesting a potential complementary relationship between these two feature sets. We also tested the prognostic performance for overall survival using four feature fusion and reduction methods for combining radiomics and transfer learning features and compared the results with our proposed risk score-based feature fusion method. It was shown that the risk score-based feature fusion method significantly improves the prognosis performance for predicting overall survival in PDAC patients compared to other traditional feature reduction methods used in previous radiomics studies (40% increase in area under ROC curve (AUC) yielding AUC of 0.84)."

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening with CT require detailed smoking information and miss many incident lung cancers. An automated deep-learning approach based on chest radiograph images may identify more smokers at high risk for lung cancer who could benefit from screening with CT.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CXR-LC) that predicts long-term incident lung cancer using data commonly available in the electronic medical record (EMR) (chest radiograph, age, sex, and whether currently smoking).
DESIGN: Risk prediction study.
SETTING: U.S. lung cancer screening trials.
PARTICIPANTS: The CXR-LC model was developed in the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial (n = 41 856). The final CXR-LC model was validated in additional PLCO smokers (n = 5615, 12-year follow-up) and NLST (National Lung Screening Trial) heavy smokers (n = 5493, 6-year follow-up). Results are reported for validation data sets only.
MEASUREMENTS: Up to 12-year lung cancer incidence predicted by CXR-LC.
RESULTS: The CXR-LC model had better discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for incident lung cancer than CMS eligibility (PLCO AUC, 0.755 vs. 0.634; P &lt; 0.001). The CXR-LC model's performance was similar to that of PLCO<sub>M2012</sub>, a state-of-the-art risk score with 11 inputs, in both the PLCO data set (CXR-LC AUC of 0.755 vs. PLCO<sub>M2012</sub> AUC of 0.751) and the NLST data set (0.659 vs. 0.650). When compared in equal-sized screening populations, CXR-LC was more sensitive than CMS eligibility in the PLCO data set (74.9% vs. 63.8%; P = 0.012) and missed 30.7% fewer incident lung cancers. On decision curve analysis, CXR-LC had higher net benefit than CMS eligibility and similar benefit to PLCO<sub>M2012</sub>.
LIMITATION: Validation in lung cancer screening trials and not a clinical setting.
CONCLUSION: The CXR-LC model identified smokers at high risk for incident lung cancer, beyond CMS eligibility and using information commonly available in the EMR.

The quick and reliable prediction of troponin elevation for patients with chest pain from readily available ECGs may pose a valuable time-saving diagnostic tool during decision-making concerning this patient population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The data used included 15 856 ECGs from patients presenting to the emergency rooms with chest pain or dyspnoea at two centres in Sweden from 2015 to June 2023. All patients had high-sensitivity troponin test results within 6 hours after 12-lead ECG. Both troponin I (TnI) and TnT were used, with biomarker-specific cut-offs and sex-specific cut-offs for TnI. On this dataset, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) was trained 10 times, each on a unique split of the data. The final model achieved an average area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7717 (95% CI±0.0052), calibration curve analysis revealed a mean slope of 1.243 (95% CI±0.075) and intercept of -0.073 (95% CI±0.034), indicating a good correlation between prediction and ground truth. Post-classification, tuned for F1 score, accuracy was 71.43% (95% CI±1.28), with an F1 score of 0.5642 (95% CI±0.0052) and a negative predictive value of 0.8660 (95% CI±0.0048), respectively. The ResNet displayed comparable or surpassing metrics to prior presented models.
CONCLUSION: The model exhibited clinically meaningful performance, notably its high negative predictive accuracy. Therefore, clinical use of comparable neural networks in first-line, quick-response triage of patients with chest pain or dyspnoea appears as a valuable option in future medical practice."

Existing model predictions do not have actionability at an individual patient level, explainability, or biological plausibi. We sought to address these limitations of previous AI-ECG approaches by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform.
METHODS: The AIRE platform was developed in a secondary care dataset (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC]) of 1 163 401 ECGs from 189 539 patients with deep learning and a discrete-time survival model to create a patient-specific survival curve with a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE predicts not only risk of mortality, but also time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated in five diverse, transnational cohorts from the USA, Brazil, and the UK (UK Biobank [UKB]), including volunteers, primary care patients, and secondary care patients.
FINDINGS: AIRE accurately predicts risk of all-cause mortality (BIDMC C-index 0·775, 95% CI 0·773-0·776; C-indices on external validation datasets 0·638-0·773), future ventricular arrhythmia (BIDMC C-index 0·760, 95% CI 0·756-0·763; UKB C-index 0·719, 95% CI 0·635-0·803), future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·696, 0·694-0·698; 0·643, 0·624-0·662), and future heart failure (0·787, 0·785-0·789; 0·768, 0·733-0·802). Through phenome-wide and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate biological pathways for the prediction of increased risk, including changes in cardiac structure and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure, biological ageing, and metabolic syndrome.
INTERPRETATION: AIRE is an actionable, explainable, and biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform that has the potential for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical contexts for short-term and long-term risk estimation.

Quantification of immune cells in genital tissue is therefore an important outcome for studies on HIV susceptibility and prevention. Immunofluorescence microscopy allows for precise visualization of immune cells in mucosal tissues; however, this technique is limited in clinical studies by the lack of an accurate, unbiased, high-throughput image analysis method. Current pixel-based thresholding methods for cell counting struggle in tissue regions with high cell density and autofluorescence, both of which are common features in genital tissue. We describe a deep-learning approach using the publicly available StarDist method to count cells in immunofluorescence microscopy images of foreskin stained for nuclei, CD3, CD4, and CCR5. The accuracy of the model was comparable to manual counting (gold standard) and surpassed the capability of a previously described pixel-based cell counting method. We show that the performance of our deep-learning model is robust in tissue regions with high cell density and high autofluorescence. Moreover, we show that this deep-learning analysis method is both easy to implement and to adapt for the identification of other cell types in genital mucosal tissue."

Epub 2021 Jan 31.,Heuvelmans MA,Lung Cancer,2021,2021/02/08,,,10.1016/j.lungcan.2021.01.027,"INTRODUCTION: Deep Learning has been proposed as promising tool to classify malignant nodules. Our aim was to retrospectively validate our Lung Cancer Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (LCP-CNN), which was trained on US screening data, on an independent dataset of indeterminate nodules in an European multicentre trial, to rule out benign nodules maintaining a high lung cancer sensitivity.
METHODS: The LCP-CNN has been trained to generate a malignancy score for each nodule using CT data from the U.S. National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and validated on CT scans containing 2106 nodules (205 lung cancers) detected in patients from from the Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (LUCINDA) study, recruited from three tertiary referral centers in the UK, Germany and Netherlands. We pre-defined a benign nodule rule-out test, to identify benign nodules whilst maintaining a high sensitivity, by calculating thresholds on the malignancy score that achieve at least 99 % sensitivity on the NLST data. Overall performance per validation site was evaluated using Area-Under-the-ROC-Curve analysis (AUC).
RESULTS: The overall AUC across the European centers was 94.5 % (95 %CI 92.6-96.1). With a high sensitivity of 99.0 %, malignancy could be ruled out in 22.1 % of the nodules, enabling 18.5 % of the patients to avoid follow-up scans. The two false-negative results both represented small typical carcinoids.
CONCLUSION: The LCP-CNN, trained on participants with lung nodules from the US NLST dataset, showed excellent performance on identification of benign lung nodules in a multi-center external dataset, ruling out malignancy with high accuracy in about one fifth of the patients with 5-15 mm nodules."

Machine learning and deep learning models show promise in improving these predictions. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates how effective these approaches are in predicting clinical outcomes at different time points using structured data.
METHODS: This study followed PRISMA guidelines, involving a comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until March 2024. Studies aimed at predicting ROSC, survival (or mortality), and neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest through the application of machine learning or deep learning techniques with structured data were included. Data extraction followed the guidelines of the CHARMS checklist, and the bias risk was evaluated using PROBAST tool. Models reporting the AUC metric with 95 % confidence intervals were incorporated into the quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis.
RESULTS: After extracting 2,753 initial records, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 97 machine learning and 16 deep learning models. The pooled AUC for predicting favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2) at hospital discharge was 0.871 (95 % CI: 0.813 - 0.928) for machine learning models and 0.877 (95 % CI: 0.831-0.924) across deep learning algorithms. For survival prediction, this value was found to be 0.837 (95 % CI: 0.757-0.916). Considerable heterogeneity and high risk of bias were observed, mainly attributable to inadequate management of missing data and the absence of calibration plots. Most studies focused on pre-hospital factors, with age, sex, and initial arrest rhythm being the most frequent features.
CONCLUSION: Predictive models utilizing AI-based approaches, including machine and deep learning models exhibit enhanced effectiveness compared to previous regression algorithms, but significant heterogeneity and high risk of bias limit their dependability. Evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models tailored for tabular data and their clinical generalizability can enhance outcome prediction after cardiac arrest."

They can be chosen by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), and are modifiable and can be synthesized. Even if the SELEX approach has been improved a lot, it is frequently challenging and time-consuming to identify aptamers experimentally. In particular, structure-based methods are the most used in computer-aided design and development of aptamers. For this purpose, numerous web-based platforms have been suggested for the purpose of forecasting the secondary structure and 3D configurations of RNAs and DNAs. Also, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), which are commonly utilized in protein compound selection by structural information, are suitable for aptamer selection. On the other hand, from a large number of sequences, artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to quickly discover the possible aptamer candidates. Conversely, sophisticated machine and deep-learning (DL) models have demonstrated efficacy in forecasting the binding properties between ligands and targets during drug discovery; as such, they may provide a reliable and precise method for forecasting the binding of aptamers to targets. This research looks at advancements in AI pipelines and strategies for aptamer binding ability prediction, such as machine and deep learning, as well as structure-based approaches, molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulation methods."

The AREDS 9-step detailed scale's complexity and implementation solely with highly trained fundus photograph graders potentially hampered its clinical use, warranting development and use of an alternate AREDS simple scale, which although valuable, has less predictive ability.
OBJECTIVE: To describe DL techniques for the AREDS 9-step detailed severity scale for AMD to estimate 5-year risk probability with reasonable accuracy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used data collected from November 13, 1992, to November 30, 2005, from 4613 study participants of the AREDS data set to develop deep convolutional neural networks that were trained to provide detailed automated AMD grading on several AMD severity classification scales, using a multiclass classification setting. Two AMD severity classification problems using criteria based on 4-step (AMD-1, AMD-2, AMD-3, and AMD-4 from classifications developed for AREDS eligibility criteria) and 9-step (from AREDS detailed severity scale) AMD severity scales were investigated. The performance of these algorithms was compared with a contemporary human grader and against a criterion standard (fundus photograph reading center graders) used at the time of AREDS enrollment and follow-up. Three methods for estimating 5-year risk were developed, including one based on DL regression. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, through April 15, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weighted κ scores and mean unsigned errors for estimating 5-year risk probability of progression to advanced AMD.
RESULTS: This study used 67 401 color fundus images from the 4613 study participants. The weighted κ scores were 0.77 for the 4-step and 0.74 for the 9-step AMD severity scales. The overall mean estimation error for the 5-year risk ranged from 3.5% to 5.3%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that DL AMD grading has, for the 4-step classification evaluation, performance comparable with that of humans and achieves promising results for providing AMD detailed severity grading (9-step classification), which normally requires highly trained graders, and for estimating 5-year risk of progression to advanced AMD. Use of DL has the potential to assist physicians in longitudinal care for individualized, detailed risk assessment as well as clinical studies of disease progression during treatment or as public screening or monitoring worldwide."

In this paper, we investigate the application of pre-trained models in diagnosing patients who are positive for COVID-19 and differentiating it from normal patients, who tested negative for coronavirus. The study aims to compare the generalization capabilities of deep learning models with two thoracic radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 chest CT images. A dataset of 3000 images was obtained from the Near East Hospital, Cyprus, and used to train and to test the three employed pre-trained models. In a test set of 250 images used to evaluate the deep neural networks and the radiologists, it was found that deep networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201) can outperform the radiologists in terms of higher accuracy (97.8%), sensitivity (98.1%), specificity (97.3%), precision (98.4%), and F1-score (198.25%), in classifying COVID-19 images."

RESULTS: The Faster R-CNN nomogram for predicting metastatic LN status contained predictors of age, metastatic LNs by Faster R-CNN and differentiation degrees of tumors, with areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.816-0.909) and 0.920 (95% CI: 0.876-0.964) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The Faster R-CNN nomogram for predicting LN metastasis degree contained predictors of metastatic LNs by Faster R-CNN and differentiation degrees of tumors, with AUCs of 0.859 (95% CI: 0.804-0.913) and 0.886 (95% CI: 0.822-0.950) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Calibration plots and decision curve analyses demonstrated good calibrations and clinical utilities. The two nomograms were used jointly as a kit for predicting metastatic LNs.
CONCLUSION: The Faster R-CNN nomogram kit exhibits excellent performance in discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility and is convenient and reliable for predicting metastatic LNs preoperatively.

37830953,Development and validation of an interpretable Markov-embedded multilabel model for predicting risks of multiple postoperative complications among surgical inpatients: a multicenter prospective cohort study,"Yu X, Zhang L, He Q, Huang Y, Wu P, Xin S, Zhang Q, Zhao S, Sun H, Lei G, Zhang T, Jiang J.",Int J Surg. 2024 Jan 1;110(1):130-143. doi: 10.1097/JS9.0000000000000817.,Yu X,Int J Surg,2024,2023/10/13,PMC10793770,,10.1097/JS9.0000000000000817,"BACKGROUND: When they encounter various highly related postoperative complications, existing risk evaluation tools that focus on single or any complications are inadequate in clinical practice. This seriously hinders complication management because of the lack of a quantitative basis. An interpretable multilabel model framework that predicts multiple complications simultaneously is urgently needed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors included 50 325 inpatients from a large multicenter cohort (2014-2017). The authors separated patients from one hospital for external validation and randomly split the remaining patients into training and internal validation sets. A MARKov-EmbeDded (MARKED) multilabel model was proposed, and three models were trained for comparison: binary relevance, a fully connected network (FULLNET), and a deep neural network. Performance was mainly evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The authors interpreted the model using Shapley Additive Explanations. Complication-specific risk and risk source inference were provided at the individual level.
RESULTS: There were 26 292, 6574, and 17 459 inpatients in the training, internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. For the external validation set, MARKED achieved the highest average AUC (0.818, 95% CI: 0.771-0.864) across eight outcomes [compared with binary relevance, 0.799 (0.748-0.849), FULLNET, 0.806 (0.756-0.856), and deep neural network, 0.815 (0.765-0.866)]. Specifically, the AUCs of MARKED were above 0.9 for cardiac complications [0.927 (0.894-0.960)], neurological complications [0.905 (0.870-0.941)], and mortality [0.902 (0.867-0.937)]. Serum albumin, surgical specialties, emergency case, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, age, and sex were the six most important preoperative variables. The interaction between complications contributed more than the preoperative variables, and formed a hierarchical chain of risk factors, mild complications, and severe complications.
CONCLUSION: The authors demonstrated the advantage of MARKED in terms of performance and interpretability. The authors expect that the identification of high-risk patients and the inference of the risk source for specific complications will be valuable for clinical decision-making."

And advanced response is being used to address this. Here, we aimed to model time series with a long short-term memory (LSTM) based on the HFMD notified data from June 2008 to June 2018 and the ultimate performance was compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear auto-regressive neural network (NAR). The results indicated that the identified best-fitting LSTM with the better superiority, be it in modeling dataset or two robustness tests dataset, than the best-conducting NAR and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) methods in forecasting performances, including the minimum indices of root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. The epidemic trends of HFMD remained stable during the study period, but the reported cases were even at significantly high levels with a notable high-risk seasonality in summer, and the incident cases projected by the LSTM would still be fairly high with a slightly upward trend in the future. In this regard, the LSTM approach should be highlighted in forecasting the epidemics of HFMD, and therefore assisting decision makers in making efficient decisions derived from the early detection of the disease incidents."

Epub 2019 Aug 13.,Wong TY,Ophthalmologica,2020,2019/08/14,,,10.1159/000502387,"Diabetes is a global public health disease projected to affect 642 million adults by 2040, with about 75% residing in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in working-aged adults. There are 3 broad strategic imperatives to prevent blindness caused by DR. Primary prevention requires preventing or delaying the onset of DR in those with diabetes by systems-level lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity or dietary modifications, pharmacological interventions for glycaemic and blood pressure control, and systematic screening for the onset of DR. Secondary prevention requires preventing the progression of DR in patients with DR by continuing systemic risk factor control, regular screening to monitor for the progression of mild DR to vision-threatening stages, and the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for managing DR. In this aspect, telemedicine-based DR screening incorporating artificial intelligence technology has the potential to facilitate more widespread and cost-effective screening, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Tertiary prevention of DR blindness has been the main focus of the clinical ophthalmology community, classically based on laser photocoagulation treatment and ocular surgery but with an increasing use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for vision-threatening DR. Evidence from serial epidemiological studies shows blindness due to DR has declined in high-income countries (e.g., the USA and UK) due to coordinated public health education efforts, increased awareness, early detection by DR screening, sustained systemic risk factor control, and the availability of effective tertiary level treatment. However, the progress made in reducing DR blindness in high-income countries may be overwhelmed by the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and DR in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, etc.). Thus, to tackle DR at a global level, a paradigm shift in strategic focus from tertiary towards secondary and primary prevention measures with a multi-pronged whole-of-society approach at regional and national levels is urgently needed."

METHODS: In a case series comprising 234 invasive ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors, clinicopathological data including Prosigna results and corresponding HE-stained tissue slides were retrieved. The digitized HE slides were analysed by Stratipath Breast.
RESULTS: Our findings showed that the Stratipath Breast analysis identified 49.6% of the clinically intermediate tumors as low risk and 50.4% as high risk. The Prosigna assay classified 32.5%, 47.0% and 20.5% tumors as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. Among Prosigna intermediate-risk tumors, 47.3% were stratified as Stratipath low risk and 52.7% as high risk. In addition, 89.7% of Stratipath low-risk cases were classified as Prosigna low/intermediate risk. The overall agreement between the two tests for low-risk and high-risk groups (N = 124) was 71.0%, with a Cohen's kappa of 0.42. For both risk profiling tests, grade and Ki67 differed significantly between risk groups.
CONCLUSION: The results from this clinical evaluation of image-based risk stratification shows a considerable agreement to an established gene expression assay in routine breast pathology."

The first class of drugs approved were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. A newer generation of reverse transcriptase inhibitors have become susceptible to drug resistant strains of HIV, and hence, alternatives are urgently needed. We have recently pioneered the use of Bayesian machine learning to generate models with public data to identify new compounds for testing against different disease targets. The current study has used the NIAID ChemDB HIV, Opportunistic Infection and Tuberculosis Therapeutics Database for machine learning studies. We curated and cleaned data from HIV-1 wild-type cell-based and reverse transcriptase (RT) DNA polymerase inhibition assays. Compounds from this database with ≤1 μM HIV-1 RT DNA polymerase activity inhibition and cell-based HIV-1 inhibition are correlated (Pearson r = 0.44, n = 1137, p < 0.0001). Models were trained using multiple machine learning approaches (Bernoulli Naive Bayes, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, support vector classification, k-Nearest Neighbors, and deep neural networks as well as consensus approaches) and then their predictive abilities were compared. Our comparison of different machine learning methods demonstrated that support vector classification, deep learning, and a consensus were generally comparable and not significantly different from each other using 5-fold cross validation and using 24 training and test set combinations. This study demonstrates findings in line with our previous studies for various targets that training and testing with multiple data sets does not demonstrate a significant difference between support vector machine and deep neural networks."

Digital technologies, such as individual voice recordings, offer an attractive modality to assess cognition but methods that could automatically analyze such data are not readily available.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used 1264 voice recordings of neuropsychological examinations administered to participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a community-based longitudinal observational study. The recordings were 73 min in duration, on average, and contained at least two speakers (participant and examiner). Of the total voice recordings, 483 were of participants with normal cognition (NC), 451 recordings were of participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 330 were of participants with dementia (DE). We developed two deep learning models (a two-level long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a convolutional neural network (CNN)), which used the audio recordings to classify if the recording included a participant with only NC or only DE and to differentiate between recordings corresponding to those that had DE from those who did not have DE (i.e., NDE (NC+MCI)). Based on 5-fold cross-validation, the LSTM model achieved a mean (±std) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.740 ± 0.017, mean balanced accuracy of 0.647 ± 0.027, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.596 ± 0.047 in classifying cases with DE from those with NC. The CNN model achieved a mean AUC of 0.805 ± 0.027, mean balanced accuracy of 0.743 ± 0.015, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.742 ± 0.033 in classifying cases with DE from those with NC. For the task related to the classification of participants with DE from NDE, the LSTM model achieved a mean AUC of 0.734 ± 0.014, mean balanced accuracy of 0.675 ± 0.013, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.671 ± 0.015. The CNN model achieved a mean AUC of 0.746 ± 0.021, mean balanced accuracy of 0.652 ± 0.020, and mean weighted F1 score of 0.635 ± 0.031 in classifying cases with DE from those who were NDE.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that automated deep learning-driven processing of audio recordings of neuropsychological testing performed on individuals recruited within a community cohort setting can facilitate dementia screening."

CT protocols have evolved from pre-fixed settings in early lung cancer screening studies starting in 2004 towards automatic optimized settings in current international guidelines. The acquisition protocols of large lung cancer screening studies and guidelines are summarized. Radiation dose may vary considerably between CT protocols, but has reduced gradually over the years. Ultra-low dose acquisition can be achieved by applying latest dose reduction techniques. The use of low tube current or tin-filter in combination with iterative reconstruction allow to reduce the radiation dose to a submilliSievert level. However, one should be cautious in reducing the radiation dose to ultra-low dose settings since performed studies lacked generalizability. Continuous efforts are made by international radiology organizations to streamline the CT data acquisition and image quality assurance and to keep track of new developments in CT lung cancer screening. Examples like computer-aided diagnosis and radiomic feature extraction are discussed and current limitations are outlined. Deep learning-based solutions in post-processing of CT images are provided. Finally, future perspectives and recommendations are provided for lung cancer screening CT protocols."

The recent shift from hip- to wrist-worn accelerometers in these fields has signaled the need to develop novel approaches to process raw acceleration data of physical activity and sedentary behavior. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the best practices for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data to accurately predict individuals' energy expenditure and the times spent in different intensities of free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior. To this end, accurately analyzing and interpreting wrist-worn accelerometer data has become a major challenge facing many clinicians and researchers. In response, this paper attempts to review different methodologies for analyzing wrist-worn accelerometer data and offer cutting edge, yet appropriate analysis plans for wrist-worn accelerometer data in the assessment of physical behavior. In this paper, we first discuss the fundamentals of wrist-worn accelerometer data, followed by various methods of processing these data (e.g., cut points, steps per minute, machine learning), and then we discuss the opportunities, challenges, and directions for future studies in this area of inquiry. This is the most comprehensive review paper to date regarding the analysis and interpretation of free-living physical activity data derived from wrist-worn accelerometers, aiming to help establish a blueprint for processing wrist-derived accelerometer data."

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep transfer learning techniques to classify kidneys of normal children and those with CAKUT.
STUDY DESIGN: A transfer learning method was developed to extract features of kidneys from ultrasound images obtained during routine clinical care of 50 children with CAKUT and 50 controls. To classify diseased and normal kidneys, support vector machine classifiers were built on the extracted features using (1) transfer learning imaging features from a pretrained deep learning model, (2) conventional imaging features, and (3) their combination. These classifiers were compared, and their diagnosis performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
RESULTS: The AUC for classifiers built on the combination features were 0.92, 0.88, and 0.92 for discriminating the left, right, and bilateral abnormal kidney scans from controls with classification rates of 84%, 81%, and 87%; specificity of 84%, 74%, and 88%; and sensitivity of 85%, 88%, and 86%, respectively. These classifiers performed better than classifiers built on either the transfer learning features or the conventional features alone (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The present study validated transfer learning techniques for imaging feature extraction of ultrasound images to build classifiers for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls. The experiments have demonstrated that the classifiers built on the transfer learning features and conventional image features could distinguish abnormal kidney images from controls with AUCs greater than 0.88, indicating that classification of ultrasound kidney scans has a great potential to aid kidney disease diagnosis. A limitation of the present study is the moderate number of patients that contributed data to the transfer learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of transfer learning and conventional imaging features yielded the best classification performance for distinguishing children with CAKUT from controls based on ultrasound images of kidneys."

Since misdiagnoses are common, many pediatric patients fail to receive the correct treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging has been used for the evaluation of pediatric epilepsy. However, the epileptic focus is very difficult to be identified by visual assessment since it may present either hypo- or hyper-metabolic abnormality with unclear boundary. This study aimed to develop a novel symmetricity-driven deep learning framework of PET imaging for the identification of epileptic foci in pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
METHODS: We retrospectively included 201 pediatric patients with TLE and 24 age-matched controls who underwent 18F-FDG PET-CT studies. 18F-FDG PET images were quantitatively investigated using 386 symmetricity features, and a pair-of-cube (PoC)-based Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed for precise localization of epileptic focus, and then metabolic abnormality level of the predicted focus was calculated automatically by asymmetric index (AI). Performances of the proposed framework were compared with visual assessment, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software, and Jensen-Shannon divergence-based logistic regression (JS-LR) analysis.
RESULTS: The proposed deep learning framework could detect the epileptic foci accurately with the dice coefficient of 0.51, which was significantly higher than that of SPM (0.24, P < 0.01) and significantly (or marginally) higher than that of visual assessment (0.31-0.44, P = 0.005-0.27). The area under the curve (AUC) of the PoC classification was higher than that of the JS-LR (0.93 vs. 0.72). The metabolic level detection accuracy of the proposed method was significantly higher than that of visual assessment blinded or unblinded to clinical information (90% vs. 56% or 68%, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The proposed deep learning framework for 18F-FDG PET imaging could identify epileptic foci accurately and efficiently, which might be applied as a computer-assisted approach for the future diagnosis of epilepsy patients.

Although traditional track-and-trigger systems are used to predict cardiac arrest early, they have limitations, with low sensitivity and high false-alarm rates. We propose a deep learning-based early warning system that shows higher performance than the existing track-and-trigger systems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed patients who were admitted to 2 hospitals from June 2010 to July 2017. A total of 52 131 patients were included. Specifically, a recurrent neural network was trained using data from June 2010 to January 2017. The result was tested using the data from February to July 2017. The primary outcome was cardiac arrest, and the secondary outcome was death without attempted resuscitation. As comparative measures, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the net reclassification index. Furthermore, we evaluated sensitivity while varying the number of alarms. The deep learning-based early warning system (AUROC: 0.850; AUPRC: 0.044) significantly outperformed a modified early warning score (AUROC: 0.603; AUPRC: 0.003), a random forest algorithm (AUROC: 0.780; AUPRC: 0.014), and logistic regression (AUROC: 0.613; AUPRC: 0.007). Furthermore, the deep learning-based early warning system reduced the number of alarms by 82.2%, 13.5%, and 42.1% compared with the modified early warning system, random forest, and logistic regression, respectively, at the same sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on deep learning had high sensitivity and a low false-alarm rate for detection of patients with cardiac arrest in the multicenter study."

Machine learning models built from data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded into the model.
METHODS: In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time.
RESULTS: Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 h before sepsis onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24 h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in time.
CONCLUSION: We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in our dataset."

Fermented dairy products consumption as the implementation of specific dietary priority contributes to a lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Various lipid types play different roles in cardiometabolic health and fermentation process changes the lipid profile in dairy products. Leveraging the power of multiple biological datasets can provide mechanistic insights into how proteins impact lipid pathways, and establish connections among fermentation-lipid biomarkers-protein. The recent leap of deep learning has been performed in food category recognition, agro-food freshness detection, and food flavor prediction and regulation. The proposed multimodal deep learning method includes four steps: (i) Forming data matrices based on data generated from different omics layers. (ii) Decomposing high-dimensional omics data according to self-attention mechanism. (iii) Constructing View Correlation Discovery Network to learn the cross-omics correlations and integrate different omics datasets.

Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), can often achieve higher predictive performance than conventional models. In this study, we trained a DNN to predict 90-day post-transplant mortality using preoperative variables and compared the performance to that of the Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation (SOFT) and Balance of Risk (BAR) scores, using United Network of Organ Sharing data on adult patients who received a deceased donor liver transplant between 2005 and 2015 (n = 57,544). The DNN was trained using 202 features, and the best DNN's architecture consisted of 5 hidden layers with 110 neurons each. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of the best DNN model was 0.703 (95% CI: 0.682-0.726) as compared to 0.655 (95% CI: 0.633-0.678) and 0.688 (95% CI: 0.667-0.711) for the BAR score and SOFT score, respectively. In conclusion, despite the complexity of DNN, it did not achieve a significantly higher discriminative performance than the SOFT score. Future risk models will likely benefit from the inclusion of other data sources, including high-resolution clinical features for which DNNs are particularly apt to outperform conventional statistical methods."

Atherosclerosis disease in the arteries is the main cause of the CVD, leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. The two primary image-based phenotypes used for monitoring the atherosclerosis burden is carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaque area (PA). Earlier segmentation and measurement methods were based on ad hoc conventional and semi-automated digital imaging solutions, which are unreliable, tedious, slow, and not robust. This study reviews the modern and automated methods such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can provide automated techniques in the detection and measurement of cIMT and PA from carotid vascular images. Both ML and DL techniques are examples of supervised learning, i.e., learn from ""ground truth"" images and transformation of test images that are not part of the training. This review summarizes (1) the evolution and impact of the fast-changing AI technology on cIMT/PA measurement, (2) the mathematical representations of ML/DL methods, and (3) segmentation approaches for cIMT/PA regions in carotid scans based for (a) region-of-interest detection and (b) lumen-intima and media-adventitia interface detection using ML/DL frameworks. AI-based methods for cIMT/PA segmentation have emerged for CVD/stroke risk monitoring and may expand to the recommended parameters for atherosclerosis assessment by carotid ultrasound."

This review presents the foundational principles of multimodal learning including oncology data modalities, taxonomy of multimodal learning, and fusion strategies. We delve into the recent advancements in GNNs and Transformers for the fusion of multimodal data in oncology, spotlighting key studies and their pivotal findings. We discuss the unique challenges of multimodal learning, such as data heterogeneity and integration complexities, alongside the opportunities it presents for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of cancer. Finally, we present some of the latest comprehensive multimodal pan-cancer data sources. By surveying the landscape of multimodal data integration in oncology, our goal is to underline the transformative potential of multimodal GNNs and Transformers.

We compared the random survival forest (RSF) and DeepSurv models with the CPH model to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in non-metastatic clear cell RCC (nm-cRCC) patients. Our cohort included 2139 nm-cRCC patients who underwent curative-intent surgery at six Korean institutions between 2000 and 2014. The data of two largest hospitals' patients were assigned into the training and validation dataset, and the data of the remaining hospitals were assigned into the external validation dataset. The performance of the RSF and DeepSurv models was compared with that of CPH using Harrel's C-index. During the follow-up, recurrence and cancer-specific deaths were recorded in 190 (12.7%) and 108 (7.0%) patients, respectively, in the training-dataset. Harrel's C-indices for RFS in the test-dataset were 0.794, 0.789, and 0.802 for CPH, RSF, and DeepSurv, respectively. Harrel's C-indices for CSS in the test-dataset were 0.831, 0.790, and 0.834 for CPH, RSF, and DeepSurv, respectively. In predicting RFS and CSS in nm-cRCC patients, the performance of DeepSurv was superior to that of CPH and RSF.

We need an accurate time-series model to predict the number of influenza patients. Although time-series models with different time lags as feature spaces could lead to varied accuracy, past studies simply adopted a time lag in their models without comparing or selecting an appropriate number of time lags. We investigated the performance of adopting 6 different time lags in 6 different models: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with hyperparameter adjustment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that LSTM has been used to predict influenza outbreaks. As a result, we found that the time lag of 52 weeks led to the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the ARIMA, ANN and LSTM, while the machine learning models (SVR, RF, GB) achieved the lowest MAPEs with a time lag of 4 weeks. We also found that the MAPEs of the machine learning models were less than ARIMA, and the MAPEs of the deep learning models (ANN, LSTM) were less than those of the machine learning models. In all the models, the LSTM model of 4 layers reached the lowest MAPE of 5.4%, and the LSTM model of 5 layers with regularization reached the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.00210."

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, natural history study with up to 15 years of follow-up.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred nine CFIs of 238 eyes with GA from the Rotterdam Study (RS) and Blue Mountain Eye Study (BMES) for model development, and 3589 CFIs of 376 eyes from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) for analysis of GA growth rate.
METHODS: A deep learning model based on an ensemble of encoder-decoder architectures was implemented and optimized for the segmentation of GA in CFIs. Four experienced graders delineated, in consensus, GA in CFIs from the RS and BMES. These manual delineations were used to evaluate the segmentation model using 5-fold cross-validation. The model was applied further to CFIs from the AREDS to study the growth rate of GA. Linear regression analysis was used to study associations between structural biomarkers at baseline and the GA growth rate. A general estimate of the progression of GA area over time was made by combining growth rates of all eyes with GA from the AREDS set.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Automatically segmented GA and GA growth rate.
RESULTS: The model obtained an average Dice coefficient of 0.72±0.26 on the BMES and RS set while comparing the automatically segmented GA area with the graders' manual delineations. An intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 was reached between the automatically estimated GA area and the graders' consensus measures. Nine automatically calculated structural biomarkers (area, filled area, convex area, convex solidity, eccentricity, roundness, foveal involvement, perimeter, and circularity) were significantly associated with growth rate. Combining all growth rates indicated that GA area grows quadratically up to an area of approximately 12 mm2, after which growth rate stabilizes or decreases.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning model allowed for fully automatic and robust segmentation of GA on CFIs. These segmentations can be used to extract structural characteristics of GA that predict its growth rate."

Seven hundred ninety-two right lateral radiographs from canine patients with thoracic radiographs and contemporaneous echocardiograms were used to train, validate, and test a convolutional neural network algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for determination of left atrial enlargement were then compared with those of board-certified veterinary radiologists as recorded on radiology reports. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 82.71%, 68.42%, and 87.09%, respectively, using an accuracy driven variant of the convolutional neural network algorithm and 79.01%, 73.68%, and 80.64%, respectively, using a sensitivity driven variant. By comparison, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved by board-certified veterinary radiologists was 82.71%, 68.42%, and 87.09%, respectively. Although overall accuracy of the accuracy driven convolutional neural network algorithm and veterinary radiologists was identical, concordance between the two approaches was 85.19%.

We developed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for hip fractures on plain X-rays using a deep learning model trained on a large dataset. In this study, we examined whether the accuracy of the diagnosis of hip fracture of the residents could be improved by using this system.
METHODS: A deep convolutional neural network approach was used for machine learning. Pytorch 1.3 and Fast.ai 1.0 were applied as frameworks, and an EfficientNet-B4 model (a pre-trained ImageNet model) was used. We handled the 5295 X-rays from the patients with femoral neck fracture or femoral trochanteric fracture from 2009 to 2019. We excluded cases in which the bilateral hips were not included within an image range, and cases of femoral shaft fracture and periprosthetic fracture. Finally, we included 5242 AP pelvic X-rays from 4851 cases. We divided these 5242 images into two images per image, and prepared 5242 images including fracture site and 5242 images without fracture site. Thus, a total of 10,484 images were used for machine learning. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value, and area under the curve (AUC) were assessed. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to conceptualize the basis for the diagnosis of the fracture by the deep learning algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a controlled experiment with clinicians. Thirty-one residents;young doctors within 2 years of graduation from medical school who rotate through various specialties, were tested using 300 hip fracture images that were randomly extracted from the dataset. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy with and without the use of the CAD system for each of the 300 images.
RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value, and AUC were 96.1, 95.2, 96.9%, 0.961, and 0.99, respectively, with the correct diagnostic basis generated by Grad-CAM. In the controlled experiment, the diagnostic accuracy of the residents significantly improved when they used the CAD system.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a newly CAD system with a deep learning algorithm from a relatively large dataset from multiple institutions. Our system achieved high diagnostic performance. Our system improved the diagnostic accuracy of residents for hip fractures.

Traditional deep learning, while often accurate in predicting response, is unlikely to capture the true sequence of involved molecular interactions. Our work is motivated by two assumptions: 1) Methods that encourage mechanistic prediction logic are likely to be more trustworthy, and 2) problem-specific algorithms are likely to outperform generic algorithms. We present an alternative to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) termed Graph Structured Neural Networks (GSNN), which uses cell signaling knowledge, encoded as a graph data structure, to add inductive biases to deep learning. We apply our method to perturbation biology using the LINCS L1000 dataset and literature-curated molecular interactions. We demonstrate that GSNNs outperform baseline algorithms in several prediction tasks, including 1) perturbed expression, 2) cell viability of drug combinations, and 3) disease-specific drug prioritization. We also present a method called GSNNExplainer to explain GSNN predictions in a biologically interpretable form. This work has broad application in basic biological research and pre-clincal drug repurposing. Further refinement of these methods may produce trustworthy models of drug response suitable for use as clinical decision aids.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD)/stroke risk has been widely understood with the help of carotid artery disease (CTAD), a surrogate biomarker for CHD. The proposed study emphasizes artificial intelligence-based frameworks such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that can accurately predict the severity of CVD/stroke risk using carotid wall arterial imaging in ED patients.
METHODS: Using the PRISMA model, 231 of the best studies were selected. The proposed study mainly consists of two components: (i) the pathophysiology of ED and its link with coronary artery disease (COAD) and CHD in the ED framework and (ii) the ultrasonic-image morphological changes in the carotid arterial walls by quantifying the wall parameters and the characterization of the wall tissue by adapting the ML/DL-based methods, both for the prediction of the severity of CVD risk. The proposed study analyzes the hypothesis that ML/DL can lead to an accurate and early diagnosis of the CVD/stroke risk in ED patients. Our finding suggests that the routine ED patient practice can be amended for ML/DL-based CVD/stroke risk assessment using carotid wall arterial imaging leading to fast, reliable, and accurate CVD/stroke risk stratification.
SUMMARY: We conclude that ML and DL methods are very powerful tools for the characterization of CVD/stroke in patients with varying ED conditions. We anticipate a rapid growth of these tools for early and better CVD/stroke risk management in ED patients."

METHODS: We randomly selected patients with diabetes screened twice, two years apart within a nationwide screening program. The reference standard was established via adjudication by retina specialists. Each patient's color fundus photographs were graded, and a patient was considered as having sight-threatening DR (STDR) if the worse eye had severe nonproliferative DR, proliferative DR, or diabetic macular edema. We compared DR screening via two modalities: DL and HG. For each modality, we simulated treatment referral by excluding patients with detected STDR from the second screening using that modality.
RESULTS: There were 5,738 patients (12.3% STDR) in the first screening. DL and HG captured different numbers of STDR cases, and after simulated referral and excluding ungradable cases, 4,148 and 4,263 patients remained in the second screening, respectively. The STDR prevalence at the second screening was 5.1% and 6.8% for DL- and HG-based screening, respectively. Along with the prevalence decrease, the sensitivity for both modalities decreased from the first to the second screening (DL: from 95% to 90%, p = 0.008; HG: from 74% to 57%, p &lt; 0.001). At both the first and second screenings, the rate of false negatives for the DL was a fifth that of HG (0.5-0.6% vs. 2.9-3.2%).
CONCLUSION: On 2-year longitudinal follow-up of a DR screening cohort, STDR prevalence decreased for both DL- and HG-based screening. Follow-up screenings in longitudinal DR screening can be more difficult and induce lower sensitivity for both DL and HG, though the false negative rate was substantially lower for DL. Our data may be useful for health-economics analyses of longitudinal screening settings."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI examinations of patients from the French prospective multicenter DESIR cohort (DEvenir des Spondyloarthropathies Indifférenciées Récentes) were used for training, validation and testing. Patients with inflammatory back pain lasting three months to three years were recruited. Test datasets were from MRI follow-ups at five years and ten years. The model was evaluated using an external test dataset from the ASAS cohort. A neuronal network classifier (mask-RCNN) was trained and evaluated for sacroiliac joints detection and BME classification. Diagnostic capabilities of the model to predict ASAS MRI active sacroiliitis (BME in at least two half-slices) were assessed using Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC. The gold standard was experts' majority decision.
RESULTS: A total of 256 patients with 362 MRI examinations from the DESIR cohort were included, with 27% meeting the ASAS definition for experts. A total of 178 MRI examinations were used for the training set, 25 for the validation set and 159 for the evaluation set. MCCs for DESIR baseline, 5-years, and 10-years follow-up were 0.90 (n = 53), 0.64 (n = 70), and 0.61 (n = 36), respectively. AUCs for predicting ASAS MRI were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.79-1), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.62-1), respectively. The ASAS external validation cohort included 47 patients (mean age 36 ± 10 [SD] years; women, 51%) with 19% meeting the ASAS definition. MCC was 0.62, sensitivity 56% (95% CI: 42-70), specificity 100% (95% CI: 100-100) and AUC 0.76 (95% CI: 0.57-0.95).

METHODS: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists' reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm3. An average running speed of 20.3 s ± 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p &lt; 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p &lt; 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists.
KEY POINTS: • The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. • The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. • The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung."

Random forests methods have shown promise in speeding up this process, but they lag behind human classification accuracy by about 5%. We explore whether more recently available document classification algorithms can close this gap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data gathered from a single surveillance site, we applied 8 supervised learning algorithms to predict whether children meet the case definition for ASD based solely on the words in their evaluations. We compared the algorithms' performance across 10 random train-test splits of the data, using classification accuracy, F1 score, and number of positive calls to evaluate their potential use for surveillance.
RESULTS: Across the 10 train-test cycles, the random forest and support vector machine with Naive Bayes features (NB-SVM) each achieved slightly more than 87% mean accuracy. The NB-SVM produced significantly more false negatives than false positives (P = 0.027), but the random forest did not, making its prevalence estimates very close to the true prevalence in the data. The best-performing neural network performed similarly to the random forest on both measures.
DISCUSSION: The random forest performed as well as more recently available models like the NB-SVM and the neural network, and it also produced good prevalence estimates. NB-SVM may not be a good candidate for use in a fully-automated surveillance workflow due to increased false negatives. More sophisticated algorithms, like hierarchical convolutional neural networks, may not be feasible to train due to characteristics of the data. Current algorithms might perform better if the data are abstracted and processed differently and if they take into account information about the children in addition to their evaluations.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning models performed similarly to traditional machine learning methods at predicting the clinician-assigned case status for CDC's autism surveillance system. While deep learning methods had limited benefit in this task, they may have applications in other surveillance systems."

The Cox proportional hazard regression model generally is used based on an assumption of linear association. However, it is likely that, in reality, there are many clinicopathologic features that exhibit a nonlinear association in biomedicine.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the deep-learning neural network model and the Cox proportional hazard regression model in the prediction of survival in women with cervical cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective pilot study of consecutive cases of newly diagnosed stage I-IV cervical cancer from 2000-2014. A total of 40 features that included patient demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, tumor characteristics, and treatment types were assessed for analysis and grouped into 3 feature sets. The deep-learning neural network model was compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model and 3 other survival analysis models for progression-free survival and overall survival. Mean absolute error and concordance index were used to assess the performance of these 5 models.
RESULTS: There were 768 women included in the analysis. The median age was 49 years, and the majority were Hispanic (71.7%). The majority of tumors were squamous (75.3%) and stage I (48.7%). The median follow-up time was 40.2 months; there were 241 events for recurrence and progression and 170 deaths during the follow-up period. The deep-learning model showed promising results in the prediction of progression-free survival when compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model (mean absolute error, 29.3 vs 316.2). The deep-learning model also outperformed all the other models, including the Cox proportional hazard regression model, for overall survival (mean absolute error, Cox proportional hazard regression vs deep-learning, 43.6 vs 30.7). The performance of the deep-learning model further improved when more features were included (concordance index for progression-free survival: 0.695 for 20 features, 0.787 for 36 features, and 0.795 for 40 features). There were 10 features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the deep-learning model, but not in the Cox proportional hazard regression model. There were no features for progression-free survival and 3 features for overall survival that demonstrated significance only in the Cox proportional hazard regression model, but not in the deep-learning model.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the deep-learning neural network model may be a useful analytic tool for survival prediction in women with cervical cancer because it exhibited superior performance compared with the Cox proportional hazard regression model. This novel analytic approach may provide clinicians with meaningful survival information that potentially could be integrated into treatment decision-making and planning. Further validation studies are necessary to support this pilot study."

Therefore, this study aimed to utilize drug information as the main predictor to develop and validate survival models for severe HF patients during this period.
METHODS: We extracted severe HF patients from the MIMIC-IV database (as training and internal validation cohorts) as well as from the MIMIC-III database and local hospital (as external validation cohorts). Three algorithms, including Cox proportional hazards model (CoxPH), random survival forest (RSF), and deep learning survival prediction (DeepSurv), were applied to incorporate the parameters (partial hospitalization information and exposure durations of drugs) for constructing survival prediction models. The model performance was assessed mainly using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), brier score (BS), and decision curve analysis (DCA). The model interpretability was determined by the permutation importance and Shapley additive explanations values.
RESULTS: A total of 11,590 patients were included in this study. Among the 3 models, the CoxPH model ultimately included 10 variables, while RSF and DeepSurv models incorporated 24 variables, respectively. All of the 3 models achieved respectable performance metrics while the DeepSurv model exhibited the highest AUC values and relatively lower BS among these models. The DCA also verified that the DeepSurv model had the best clinical practicality.
CONCLUSIONS: The survival prediction tools established in this study can be applied to severe HF patients during vulnerable period by mainly inputting drug treatment duration, thus contributing to optimal clinical decisions prospectively."

Pathologists grade the microscopic appearance of breast tissue using the Nottingham criteria, which is qualitative and does not account for non-cancerous elements within the tumor microenvironment (TME). We present the Histomic Prognostic Signature (HiPS), a comprehensive, interpretable scoring of the survival risk incurred by breast TME morphology. HiPS uses deep learning to accurately map cellular and tissue structures in order to measure epithelial, stromal, immune, and spatial interaction features. It was developed using a population-level cohort from the Cancer Prevention Study (CPS)-II and validated using data from three independent cohorts, including the PLCO trial, CPS-3, and The Cancer Genome Atlas. HiPS consistently outperformed pathologists' performance in predicting survival outcomes, independent of TNM stage and pertinent variables. This was largely driven by stromal and immune features. In conclusion, HiPS is a robustly validated biomarker to support pathologists and improve prognosis."

Epub 2022 Nov 29.,Hernigou P,Int Orthop,2023,2022/11/29,,,10.1007/s00264-022-05644-2,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to provide an overview of the possibility regarding the artificial intelligence application in orthopaedics to predict dislocation with a calculator according to the type of implant (hemiarthroplasty, standard total hip arthroplasty, dual mobility, constrained cups) after primary arthroplasty.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 75 results for primary arthroplasties, 26 articles were reviews on dislocation after hemiarthroplasty, 40 after standard total hip arthroplasty, seven about primary dual-mobility arthroplasty (DM THA), and two reviews about constrained implants. Although our search method for systematic reviews covers ten years (2012-2022), none for dual mobility was published before 2016, showing a recent explosion of original articles on this subject. A total of 1,069,565 implants and 26,488 dislocations in primary arthroplasties are included in these 75 reviews. We used a supervised learning model in which models assign objects to groups as input and artificial neural network (ANN) with nodes, hidden layers, and output layers. We considered only four implant types as the input layer. We considered the patient's factors (indication for THA, demographics, spine surgery, and neurologic disease) as the second input values (hidden layer). We considered the implant position as the third input (hidden layer) property including head size, combined anteversion, or spinopelvic alignment. Surgery-related factors, approach, capsule repair, etc. were the fourth input values (hidden layer). The output was a post-operative dislocation or not within three months.
RESULTS: The accuracy for predicting dislocation with this systematic review was 95%. Dislocation risk, based on the type of implant, was wide-ranging, from 0 to 3.9% (mean 0.31%) for the 3045 DM THA, from 0.2 to 1.2% (overall 0.91%) for the 457 constrained liners, from 1.76 to 4.2% (mean 2.1%) for 895,734 conventional total hip arthroplasties, and from 0.76 to 12.2% (mean 4.5%) for 170,329 hemiarthroplasties. In the conventional THA group, many factors increase the risk of dislocation according to the calculator, and only a few (big head, anterior approach) decrease the risk, but not very significantly. In the hemiarthroplasty group, many factors can increase the risk of dislocation until 30%, but none could decrease the risk. According to the calculator, the DM THA and the constrained liner markedly decreased the risk and were not affected by implant position, spine surgery, and spinopelvic position.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to yield an implant-specific dislocation risk calculator that incorporates the patient's comorbidities, the position of components, and surgery factors affecting instability risk."

In the face of the severe situation of epidemic prevention and control and the arduous task of social management, the tremendous power of science and technology in prevention and control has emerged. The new generation of information technology, represented by big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, has been widely used in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of COVID-19 as an important basic support. Although the technology has developed, there are still challenges with respect to epidemic surveillance, accurate prevention and control, effective diagnosis and treatment, and timely judgement. The prevention and control of sudden infectious diseases usually depend on the control of infection sources, interruption of transmission channels and vaccine development. Big data and AI are effective technologies to identify the source of infection and have an irreplaceable role in distinguishing close contacts and suspicious populations. Advanced computational analysis is beneficial to accelerate the speed of vaccine research and development and to improve the quality of vaccines. AI provides support in automatically processing relevant data from medical images and clinical features, tests and examination findings; predicting disease progression and prognosis; and even recommending treatment plans and strategies. This paper reviews the application of big data and AI in the COVID-19 prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management decisions in China to explain how to apply big data and AI technology to address the common problems in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the findings regarding the application of big data and AI technologies in sudden public health events lack validation of repeatability and universality, current studies in China have shown that the application of big data and AI is feasible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These studies concluded that the application of big data and AI technology can contribute to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management decision making regarding sudden public health events in the future."

RESULTS: Using seven vital signs, along with patient age and body weight on intensive care unit admission, PROMPT achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the range of 0.89-0.97 for mortality prediction 6 to 60 h prior to death. Our results demonstrated that PROMPT provided high sensitivity with specificity and outperformed the conventional severity scoring system, the Pediatric Index of Mortality, in predictive ability. Model performance was indistinguishable between the development and validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: PROMPT is a deep model-based, data-driven early warning score tool that can predict mortality in critically ill children and may be useful for the timely identification of deteriorating patients."

The virus first originated in Wuhan (China) and rapidly affected most of the world's population. This outbreak's impact is experienced worldwide because it causes high mortality risk, many cases, and economic falls. Around the globe, the total number of cases and deaths reported till November 12, 2022, were >600 million and 6.6 million, respectively. During the period of COVID-19, several diverse diagnostic techniques have been proposed. This work presents a systematic review of COVID-19 diagnostic techniques in response to such acts. Initially, these techniques are classified into different categories based on their working principle and detection modalities, i.e. chest X-ray imaging, cough sound or respiratory patterns, RT-PCR, antigen testing, and antibody testing. After that, a comparative analysis is performed to evaluate these techniques' efficacy which may help to determine an optimum solution for a particular scenario. The findings of the proposed work show that Artificial Intelligence plays a vital role in developing COVID-19 diagnostic techniques which support the healthcare system. The related work can be a footprint for all the researchers, available under a single umbrella. Additionally, all the techniques are long-lasting and can be used for future pandemics."

The value of deep learning survival prediction models using chest radiographs in patients with heart failure is currently unclear. The aim of our study is to develop and validate a deep learning survival prediction model using chest X-ray (DLSPCXR) in patients with HF. The study retrospectively enrolled a cohort of 353 patients with HF who underwent chest X-ray (CXR) at our institution between March 2012 and March 2017. The dataset was randomly divided into training (n = 247) and validation (n = 106) datasets. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis were conducted on the training dataset to develop clinical and imaging survival prediction models. The DLSPCXR was trained and the selected clinical parameters were incorporated into DLSPCXR to establish a new model called DLSPinteg. Discrimination performance was evaluated using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (TD AUC) at 1, 3, and 5-years survival. Delong's test was employed for the comparison of differences between two AUCs of different models. The risk-discrimination capability of the optimal model was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier curve. In multivariable Cox analysis, older age, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) > 50 mmHg, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III-IV and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) ≥ 0.62 in CXR were independent predictors of poor prognosis in patients with HF. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, DLSPCXR had better performance at predicting 5-year survival than the imaging Cox model in the validation cohort (AUC: 0.757 vs. 0.561, P = 0.01). DLSPinteg as the optimal model outperforms the clinical Cox model (AUC: 0.826 vs. 0.633, P = 0.03), imaging Cox model (AUC: 0.826 vs. 0.555, P < 0.001), and DLSPCXR (AUC: 0.826 vs. 0.767, P = 0.06). Deep learning models using chest radiographs can predict survival in patients with heart failure with acceptable accuracy."

We aimed to deliver a head-to-head comparison of a conventional image analyser (CIA), which depends on segmentation and weighting of handcrafted features, to a CNN trained by deep learning.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a real-world, prospectively acquired, dermoscopic dataset of 1981 skin lesions to compare the diagnostic performance of a market-approved CNN (Moleanalyzer-Pro™, developed in 2018) to a CIA (Moleanalyzer-3™/Dynamole™; developed in 2004, all FotoFinder Systems Inc, Germany). As a reference standard, we used histopathological diagnoses (n = 785) or, in non-excised benign lesions (n = 1196), expert consensus plus an uneventful follow-up by sequential digital dermoscopy for at least 2 years.
RESULTS: A total of 281 malignant lesions and 1700 benign lesions from 435 patients (62.2% male, mean age: 52 years) were prospectively imaged. The CNN showed a sensitivity of 77.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [72.4%-82.1%]), specificity of 95.3% (95% CI: [94.2%-96.2%]), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945 (95% CI: [0.930-0.961]). In contrast, the CIA achieved a sensitivity of 53.4% (95% CI: [47.5%-59.1%]), specificity of 86.6% (95% CI: [84.9%-88.1%]) and ROC-AUC of 0.738 (95% CI: [0.701-0.774]). The data set included melanomas originally diagnosed by dynamic changes during sequential digital dermoscopy (52 of 201, 20.6%), which reduced the sensitivities of both classifiers. Pairwise comparisons of sensitivities, specificities, and ROC-AUCs indicated a clear outperformance by the CNN (all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The superior diagnostic performance of the CNN argues against a continued application of former CIAs as an aide to physicians' clinical management decisions."

Epub 2018 Nov 16.,Staartjes VE,Spine J,2019,2018/11/20,,,10.1016/j.spinee.2018.11.009,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There is considerable variability in patient-reported outcome measures following surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Individualized prediction tools that are derived from center- or even surgeon-specific data could provide valuable insights for shared decision-making.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of deriving robust deep learning-based predictive analytics from single-center, single-surgeon data.
STUDY DESIGN: Derivation of predictive models from a prospective registry.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent single-level tubular microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Numeric rating scales for leg and back pain severity and Oswestry Disability Index scores at 12 months postoperatively.
METHODS: Data were derived from a prospective registry. We trained deep neural network-based and logistic regression-based prediction models for patient-reported outcome measures. The primary endpoint was achievement of the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in numeric rating scales and Oswestry Disability Index, defined as a 30% or greater improvement from baseline. Univariate predictors of MCID were also identified using conventional statistics.
RESULTS: A total of 422 patients were included (mean [SD] age: 48.5 [11.5] years; 207 [49%] female). After 1 year, 337 (80%), 219 (52%), and 337 (80%) patients reported a clinically relevant improvement in leg pain, back pain, and functional disability, respectively. The deep learning models predicted MCID with high area-under-the-curve of 0.87, 0.90, and 0.84, as well as accuracy of 85%, 87%, and 75%. The regression models provided inferior performance measures for each of the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that generating personalized and robust deep learning-based analytics for outcome prediction is feasible even with limited amounts of center-specific data. With prospective validation, the ability to preoperatively and reliably inform patients about the likelihood of symptom improvement could prove useful in patient counselling and shared decision-making."

Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines.
METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19-related keywords and then using vaccine- and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom.
RESULTS: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates.
CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes."

However, whether subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) contribute differently to the progress of cancer cachexia in gastric cancer patients with cachexia remains unclear. This study aim to investigate the effect of SAT and VAT in gastric cancer patients with cachexia.
METHODS: Gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery were divided into cancer cachexia group and non-cachexia group. A new deep learning system was developed to segment SAT and VAT from the computed tomography images at the third lumbar vertebra. Indexes of SAT (SATI) and VAT (VATI) were compared between cachexia and non-cachexia groups. The prognostic values of SATI and VATI for patients with gastric cancer cachexia were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.
RESULTS: A total of 1627 gastric cancer patients (411 cachexia and 1216 non-cachexia) were included in this study. A new V-Net-Based segmentation deep learning system was developed to quickly (0.02 s/image) and accurately segment SAT (dice scores = 0.96) and VAT (dice scores = 0.98). The SATI of gastric cancer patients with cachexia were significantly lower than non-cachexia patients (44.91 ± 0.90 vs. 50.92 ± 0.71 cm2/m2, P &lt; 0.001), whereas no significant difference was detected in VATI (35.98 ± 0.84 VS. 37.90 ± 0.45 cm2/m2, P = 0.076). Cachexia patients with low SATI showed poor survival than those with high SATI (HR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.06-1.74). In contrast, VATI did not show close correlation with survival in patients with cachexia (HR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.92-1.51).
CONCLUSION: SAT and VAT showed different effects on gastric cancer patients with cachexia. More attention should be paid to the loss of SAT during the progress of cancer cachexia."

A precise prognostic tool to identify poor outcomes among such cases is desperately needed.
METHODS: Total 400 COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions were retrospectively recruited from 4 centers, including 54 dead cases (labeled as poor outcomes) and 346 patients discharged or hospitalized for at least 7 days since initial CT scan. Patients were allocated to a training set (n = 271), a test set (n = 68), and an external test set (n = 61). We proposed an initial CT-derived hybrid model by combining a 3D-ResNet10 based deep learning model and a quantitative 3D radiomics model to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients reaching poor outcome. The model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), survival analysis, and subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The hybrid model achieved AUCs of 0.876 (95% confidence interval: 0.752-0.999) and 0.864 (0.766-0.962) in test and external test sets, outperforming other models. The survival analysis verified the hybrid model as a significant risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio, 2.049 [1.462-2.871], P < 0.001) that could well stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk of reaching poor outcomes (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The hybrid model that combined deep learning and radiomics could accurately identify poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions from initial CT scans. The great risk stratification ability could help alert risk of death and allow for timely surveillance plans."

However, the potential effects of CCR in gastric cancer (GC) remains to be elucidated. This multi-center retrospective study explored the predictive and prognostic value of CCR and BC-parameters in patients with metastatic GC receiving PD-1 inhibitors-based combination therapy.
METHODS: One hundred and thirteen GC patients undergoing PD-1 inhibitors-based combination therapy were enrolled at three academic medical centers from January 2021 to July 2023. A deep-learning platform based on U-Net was developed to automatically segment skeletal muscle index (SMI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) and visceral adipose tissue index (VATI). Patients were divided into two groups based on the median of CCR or the upper tertile of BC-parameters. Logistic and Cox regression analysis were used to determine the effect of CCR and BC-parameters in predicting response rates and survival rates.
RESULTS: The CCR was positively correlated with SMI (r=0.43; P<0.001), but not with SATI or VATI (P>0.05). Multivariable logistic analysis identified that both low CCR (OR=0.423, P=0.066 for ORR; OR=0.026, P=0.005 for DCR) and low SATI (OR=0.270, P=0.020 for ORR; OR=0.149, P=0.056 for DCR) were independently associated with worse objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Patients with low CCR or low SATI had significantly lower 8-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate and 16-month overall survival (OS) rate than those with high CCR (PFS rate, 37.6% vs. 55.1%, P=0.011; OS rate, 19.4% vs. 44.9%, P=0.002) or those with high SATI (PFS rate, 37.2% vs. 53.8%, P=0.035; OS rate, 8.0% vs. 36.0%, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that low CCR (HR=2.395, 95% CI: 1.234-4.648, P=0.010 for PFS rate; HR=2.528, 95% CI: 1.317-4.854, P=0.005 for OS rate) and low SATI (HR=2.188, 95% CI: 1.050-4.560, P=0.037 for PFS rate; HR=2.818, 95% CI: 1.381-5.752, P=0.004 for OS rate) were both independent prognostic factors of poor 8-month PFS rate and 16-month OS rate. A nomogram based on CCR and BC-parameters showed a good performance in predicting the 12- and 16-month OS, with a concordance index of 0.756 (95% CI, 0.722-0.789).
CONCLUSIONS: Low pre-treatment CCR and SATI were independently associated with lower response rates and worse survival in patients with metastatic GC receiving PD-1 inhibitors-based combination therapy."

A dearth of research on CVD risk scores in Indian population, limited performance of conventional risk scores and inability to reproduce the initial accuracies in randomised clinical trials has led to this study on large-scale patient data. The objective is to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based Risk Score (AICVD) to predict CVD event (eg, acute myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome) in the next 10 years and compare the model with the Framingham Heart Risk Score (FHRS) and QRisk3.
METHODS: Our study included 31 599 participants aged 18-91 years from 2009 to 2018 in six Apollo Hospitals in India. A multistep risk factors selection process using Spearman correlation coefficient and propensity score matching yielded 21 risk factors. A deep learning hazards model was built on risk factors to predict event occurrence (classification) and time to event (hazards model) using multilayered neural network. Further, the model was validated with independent retrospective cohorts of participants from India and the Netherlands and compared with FHRS and QRisk3.
RESULTS: The deep learning hazards model had a good performance (area under the curve (AUC) 0.853). Validation and comparative results showed AUCs between 0.84 and 0.92 with better positive likelihood ratio (AICVD -6.16 to FHRS -2.24 and QRisk3 -1.16) and accuracy (AICVD -80.15% to FHRS 59.71% and QRisk3 51.57%). In the Netherlands cohort, AICVD also outperformed the Framingham Heart Risk Model (AUC -0.737 vs 0.707).
CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that the novel AI-based CVD Risk Score has a higher predictive performance for cardiac events than conventional risk scores in Indian population.

It is unknown whether machine learning offers additional advantages to conventional statistical methods in prediction of ESBL production. To develop a validated model to predict ESBL production in Enterobacteriaceae causing community-onset bacteraemia. 5625 patients with community-onset bacteraemia caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis during 1 January 2015-31 December 2019 from three regional hospitals in Hong Kong were included in the analysis, after exclusion of blood cultures obtained beyond 48 h of admission. The prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was 23.7% (1335/5625).

Deep neural network yielded an AUC of 0.761 (95% CI 0.725-0.797) and F1 score of 0.661 (95% CI 0.633-0.689), which was superior to logistic regression (AUC 0.667 (95% CI 0.627-0.707), F1 score 0.596 (95% CI 0.567-0.625)). Deep neural network had a specificity of 91.5%, sensitivity of 37.5%, NPV of 82.5%, and PPV of 57.9%. Deep neural network is superior to logistic regression in predicting ESBL production in Enterobacteriaceae causing community-onset bacteraemia in high-ESBL prevalence area. Machine learning offers clinical utility in guiding judicious empirical antibiotics use."

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,Meyer A,Lancet Respir Med,2018,2018/10/03,,,10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30300-X,"BACKGROUND: The large amount of clinical signals in intensive care units can easily overwhelm health-care personnel and can lead to treatment delays, suboptimal care, or clinical errors. The aim of this study was to apply deep machine learning methods to predict severe complications during critical care in real time after cardiothoracic surgery.
METHODS: We used deep learning methods (recurrent neural networks) to predict several severe complications (mortality, renal failure with a need for renal replacement therapy, and postoperative bleeding leading to operative revision) in post cardiosurgical care in real time. Adult patients who underwent major open heart surgery from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016, in a German tertiary care centre for cardiovascular diseases formed the main derivation dataset. We measured the accuracy and timeliness of the deep learning model's forecasts and compared predictive quality to that of established standard-of-care clinical reference tools (clinical rule for postoperative bleeding, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II for mortality, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes staging criteria for acute renal failure) using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and the F<sub>1</sub> measure (which computes a harmonic mean of sensitivity and PPV). Results were externally retrospectively validated with 5898 cases from the published MIMIC-III dataset.
FINDINGS: Of 47 559 intensive care admissions (corresponding to 42 007 patients), we included 11 492 (corresponding to 9269 patients). The deep learning models yielded accurate predictions with the following PPV and sensitivity scores: PPV 0·90 and sensitivity 0·85 for mortality, 0·87 and 0·94 for renal failure, and 0·84 and 0·74 for bleeding. The predictions significantly outperformed the standard clinical reference tools, improving the absolute complication prediction AUC by 0·29 (95% CI 0·23-0·35) for bleeding, by 0·24 (0·19-0·29) for mortality, and by 0·24 (0·13-0·35) for renal failure (p<0·0001 for all three analyses). The deep learning methods showed accurate predictions immediately after patient admission to the intensive care unit. We also observed an increase in performance in our validation cohort when the machine learning approach was tested against clinical reference tools, with absolute improvements in AUC of 0·09 (95% CI 0·03-0·15; p=0·0026) for bleeding, of 0·18 (0·07-0·29; p=0·0013) for mortality, and of 0·25 (0·18-0·32; p<0·0001) for renal failure.
INTERPRETATION: The observed improvements in prediction for all three investigated clinical outcomes have the potential to improve critical care. These findings are noteworthy in that they use routinely collected clinical data exclusively, without the need for any manual processing. The deep machine learning method showed AUC scores that significantly surpass those of clinical reference tools, especially soon after admission. Taken together, these properties are encouraging for prospective deployment in critical care settings to direct the staff's attention towards patients who are most at risk.

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,Boškoski I,Gastrointest Endosc,2020,2020/05/01,PMC7184993,,10.1016/j.gie.2020.04.048,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The abrupt outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 and its rapid spread over many healthcare systems throughout the world has led to a shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE), which cannot be solved by reducing their use or by increasing production. It is thus necessary to promote PPE rational use, highlighting possible differences in terms of efficacy and promoting an effective technique to reuse them.
METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, and from the 25 top cited articles, 15 were selected for relevance and impact.
RESULTS: Most studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest surgical masks are not inferior compared with N95 respirators in terms of protective efficacy among healthcare workers. Therefore, the use of N95 respirators should be limited to high-risk situations. Concerning respirator reuse, highly energetic, short-wave, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) at 254 nm was determined to decontaminate N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents, but UVGI requires careful consideration of the type of respirator and of the biologic target.
CONCLUSIONS: Rational use and successful reuse of respirators can help in the shortage of PPE during a pandemic. Further studies testing UVGI and other decontamination techniques are an unmet need. The definitive answer to pandemic issues can be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning. These groundbreaking modalities could help in identifying high-risk patients and in suggesting appropriate types and use of PPE."

Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar, covering studies from inception until July 10, 2024. Studies were included if they used machine learning (ML) or deep learning algorithms to predict HT in AIS patients treated with thrombolysis. Exclusion criteria included studies involving endovascular treatments and those not evaluating model effectiveness. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed following PRISMA guidelines and using the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) and Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) tools. Results: Out of 1943 identified records, 12 studies were included in the final analysis, encompassing 18 007 AIS patients who received thrombolytic therapy. The ML models demonstrated high predictive performance, with pooled area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.79 to 0.95. Specifically, XGBoost models achieved AUCs of up to 0.953 and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models reached up to 0.942. Sensitivity and specificity varied significantly, with the highest sensitivity at 0.90 and specificity at 0.99. Significant predictors of HT included age, glucose levels, NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and radiomic features. Despite these promising results, methodological disparities and limited external validation highlighted the need for standardized reporting and further rigorous testing. Conclusion: ML techniques, especially XGBoost and ANN, show great promise in predicting HT following thrombolysis in AIS patients, enhancing risk stratification and clinical decision-making. Future research should focus on prospective study designs, standardized reporting, and integrating ML assessments into clinical workflows to improve AIS management and patient outcomes."

Affected countries have responded with more effective surveillance strategies to detect outbreaks early, monitor the trends, and implement prevention and control measures. We have applied newly developed machine learning approaches to identify laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from 4,894 emergency department patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who received laboratory tests. Among them, 60.11% (2942 cases) were confirmed to have dengue. Using just four input variables [age, body temperature, white blood cells counts (WBCs) and platelets], not only the state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) prediction models but also the conventional decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models delivered performances with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves areas under curves (AUCs) of the ranging from 83.75% to 85.87% [for DT, DNN and LR: 84.60% ± 0.03%, 85.87% ± 0.54%, 83.75% ± 0.17%, respectively]. Subgroup analyses found all the models were very sensitive particularly in the pre-epidemic period. Pre-peak sensitivities (<35 weeks) were 92.6%, 92.9%, and 93.1% in DT, DNN, and LR respectively. Adjusted odds ratios examined with LR for low WBCs [≤ 3.2 (x103/μL)], fever (≥38°C), low platelet counts [< 100 (x103/μL)], and elderly (≥ 65 years) were 5.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.96-6.76], 3.17 [95%CI: 2.74-3.66], 3.10 [95%CI: 2.44-3.94], and 1.77 [95%CI: 1.50-2.10], respectively. Our prediction models can readily be used in resource-poor countries where viral/serologic tests are inconvenient and can also be applied for real-time syndromic surveillance to monitor trends of dengue cases and even be integrated with mosquito/environment surveillance for early warning and immediate prevention/control measures. In other words, a local community hospital/clinic with an instrument of complete blood counts (including platelets) can provide a sentinel screening during outbreaks. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can facilitate medical and public health efforts to minimize the health threat of dengue epidemics. However, laboratory confirmation remains the primary goal of surveillance and outbreak investigation."

This study developed a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) model to estimate GA from blind ultrasonography sweeps and incorporated it into the software of a low-cost, battery-powered device.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate GA estimation accuracy of an AI-enabled ultrasonography tool when used by novice users with no prior training in sonography.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective diagnostic accuracy study enrolled 400 individuals with viable, single, nonanomalous, first-trimester pregnancies in Lusaka, Zambia, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Credentialed sonographers established the ""ground truth"" GA via transvaginal crown-rump length measurement. At random follow-up visits throughout gestation, including a primary evaluation window from 14 0/7 weeks' to 27 6/7 weeks' gestation, novice users obtained blind sweeps of the maternal abdomen using the AI-enabled device (index test) and credentialed sonographers performed fetal biometry with a high-specification machine (study standard).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean absolute error (MAE) of the index test and study standard, which was calculated by comparing each method's estimate to the previously established GA and considered equivalent if the difference fell within a prespecified margin of ±2 days.
RESULTS: In the primary evaluation window, the AI-enabled device met criteria for equivalence to the study standard, with an MAE (SE) of 3.2 (0.1) days vs 3.0 (0.1) days (difference, 0.2 days [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.5]). Additionally, the percentage of assessments within 7 days of the ground truth GA was comparable (90.7% for the index test vs 92.5% for the study standard). Performance was consistent in prespecified subgroups, including the Zambia and North Carolina cohorts and those with high body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 14 and 27 weeks' gestation, novice users with no prior training in ultrasonography estimated GA as accurately with the low-cost, point-of-care AI tool as credentialed sonographers performing standard biometry on high-specification machines. These findings have immediate implications for obstetrical care in low-resource settings, advancing the World Health Organization goal of ultrasonography estimation of GA for all pregnant people.

Images were assessed by clinical experts for quality regarding ability to diagnose ROP accurately, and were labeled ""acceptable"" or ""not acceptable."" The CNN training, validation and test sets consisted of 2,770 images, 200 images, and 3,073 images, respectively. Test set accuracy was 89.1%, with area under the receiver operating curve equal to 0.964, and area under the precision-recall curve equal to 0.966.

Model evaluations commonly report performance genome-wide; however, cis regulatory elements (CREs), which play critical roles in gene regulation, make up only a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, cell type specific CREs contain a large proportion of complex disease heritability.
RESULTS: We evaluate genomic deep learning models in chromatin accessibility regions with varying degrees of cell type specificity. We assess two modeling directions in the field: general purpose models trained across thousands of outputs (cell types and epigenetic marks), and models tailored to specific tissues and tasks. We find that the accuracy of genomic deep learning models, including two state-of-the-art general purpose models - Enformer and Sei - varies across the genome and is reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. Using accessibility models trained on cell types from specific tissues, we find that increasing model capacity to learn cell type specific regulatory syntax - through single-task learning or high capacity multi-task models - can improve performance in cell type specific accessible regions. We also observe that improving reference sequence predictions does not consistently improve variant effect predictions, indicating that novel strategies are needed to improve performance on variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a new perspective on the performance of genomic deep learning models, showing that performance varies across the genome and is particularly reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. We also identify strategies to maximize performance in cell type specific accessible regions."

Epub 2024 May 9.,Qu Z,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,2024,2024/05/10,,,10.1111/jgh.16598,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In this study, a deep learning algorithm was used to predict the survival rate of colon cancer (CC) patients, and compared its performance with traditional Cox regression.
METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used the characteristics of patients diagnosed with CC between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The population was randomized into a training set (n = 10 596, 70%) and a test set (n = 4536, 30%). Brier scores, area under the (AUC) receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curves were used to compare the performance of the three most popular deep learning models, namely, artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks with Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model.
RESULTS: In the independent test set, the Brier values of ANN, DNN, LSTM and CPH were 0.155, 0.149, 0.148, and 0.170, respectively. The AUC values were 0.906 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.897-0.916), 0.908 (95% CI 0.899-0.918), 0.910 (95% CI 0.901-0.919), and 0.793 (95% CI 0.769-0.816), respectively. Deep learning showed superior promising results than CPH in predicting CC specific survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning showed potential advantages over traditional CPH models in terms of prognostic assessment and treatment recommendations.

Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine."

The purpose of this study was to characterize AP-ROP quantitatively by demographics, rate of disease progression, and a deep learning-based vascular severity score.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: The Imaging and Informatics in ROP cohort from 8 North American centers, consisting of 947 patients and 5945 clinical eye examinations with fundus images, was used. Pretreatment eyes were categorized by disease severity: none, mild, type 2 or pre-plus, treatment-requiring (TR) without AP-ROP, TR with AP-ROP. Analyses compared TR with AP-ROP and TR without AP-ROP to investigate differences between AP-ROP and other TR disease.
METHODS: A reference standard diagnosis was generated for each eye examination using previously published methods combining 3 independent image-based gradings and 1 ophthalmoscopic grading. All fundus images were analyzed using a previously published deep learning system and were assigned a score from 1 through 9.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth weight, gestational age, postmenstrual age, and vascular severity score.
RESULTS: Infants who demonstrated AP-ROP were more premature by birth weight (617 g vs. 679 g; P = 0.01) and gestational age (24.3 weeks vs. 25.0 weeks; P < 0.01) and reached peak severity at an earlier postmenstrual age (34.7 weeks vs. 36.9 weeks; P < 0.001) compared with infants with TR without AP-ROP. The mean vascular severity score was greatest in TR with AP-ROP infants compared with TR without AP-ROP infants (8.79 vs. 7.19; P < 0.001). Analyzing the severity score over time, the rate of progression was fastest in infants with AP-ROP (P < 0.002 at 30-32 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: Premature infants in North America with AP-ROP are born younger and demonstrate disease earlier than infants with less severe ROP. Disease severity is quantifiable with a deep learning-based score, which correlates with clinically identified categories of disease, including AP-ROP. The rate of progression to peak disease is greatest in eyes that demonstrate AP-ROP compared with other treatment-requiring eyes. Analysis of quantitative characteristics of AP-ROP may help improve diagnosis and treatment of an aggressive, vision-threatening form of ROP."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 139 COVID-19 patients with dyspnea (87 men, 62.7±16.3 years) and serial chest radiographs from January to September 2020. Radiographic pneumonia extent was quantified as a percentage using a previously-developed deep learning algorithm. A group-based trajectory model was used to categorize the pneumonia trajectory after symptom onset during hospitalization. Clinical findings, and outcomes were compared, and Cox regression was performed for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Radiographic pneumonia trajectories were categorized into four groups. Group 1 (n = 83, 59.7%) had negligible pneumonia, and group 2 (n = 29, 20.9%) had mild pneumonia. Group 3 (n = 13, 9.4%) and group 4 (n = 14, 10.1%) showed similar considerable pneumonia extents at baseline, but group 3 had decreasing pneumonia extent at 1-2 weeks, while group 4 had increasing pneumonia extent. Intensive care unit admission and mortality were significantly more frequent in groups 3 and 4 than in groups 1 and 2 (P < .05). Groups 3 and 4 shared similar clinical and laboratory findings, but thrombocytopenia (<150×103/μL) was exclusively observed in group 4 (P = .016). When compared to groups 1 and 2, group 4 (hazard ratio, 63.3; 95% confidence interval, 7.9-504.9) had a two-fold higher risk for mortality than group 3 (hazard ratio, 31.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-280.2), and this elevated risk was maintained after adjusting confounders.
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the early radiologic trajectory beyond baseline further prognosticated at-risk COVID-19 patients, who potentially had thrombo-inflammatory responses."

The myxoid stroma-high group had a significantly poorer prognosis than the myxoid stroma-low group in terms of OS, disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in cohort 1. Comparable results were observed in cohort 2, where OS, DSS, and RFS were significantly affected by myxoid stroma. Multivariate analysis for RFS revealed that AI-determined myxoid stroma-high was one of the independent prognostic factors in cohort 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.97, p = 0.037) and cohort 2 (HR 4.45, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-determined myxoid stroma may be a novel and useful prognostic factor for patients with pathological stage II or III ESCC after NAC."

Epub 2024 Feb 28.,Haque S,Environ Res,2024,2024/02/28,,,10.1016/j.envres.2024.118568,"Climate, weather and environmental change have significantly influenced patterns of infectious disease transmission, necessitating the development of early warning systems to anticipate potential impacts and respond in a timely and effective way. Statistical modelling plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate relationships between climatic factors and infectious disease transmission. For example, time series regression modelling and spatial cluster analysis have been employed to identify risk factors and predict spatial and temporal patterns of infectious diseases. Recently advanced spatio-temporal models and machine learning offer an increasingly robust framework for modelling uncertainty, which is essential in climate-driven disease surveillance due to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the data. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and neural networks, excel in capturing intricate patterns and hidden relationships within climate and environmental data sets. Web-based data has emerged as a powerful complement to other datasets encompassing climate variables and disease occurrences. However, given the complexity and non-linearity of climate-disease interactions, advanced techniques are required to integrate and analyse these diverse data to obtain more accurate predictions of impending outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. This article presents an overview of an approach to creating climate-driven early warning systems with a focus on statistical model suitability and selection, along with recommendations for utilizing spatio-temporal and machine learning techniques. By addressing the limitations and embracing the recommendations for future research, we could enhance preparedness and response strategies, ultimately contributing to the safeguarding of public health in the face of evolving climate challenges."

The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity2. Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the 'primary cohort'), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the 'contemporary cohort') and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the 'clinic cohort'). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750-0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P ≤ 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes."

Epub 2018 Feb 21.,Parreco JP,J Crit Care,2018,2018/02/28,,,10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.02.010,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare machine learning techniques for predicting central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III database was queried for all ICU admissions. The variables included six different severities of illness scores calculated on the first day of ICU admission with their components and comorbidities. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, central line placement, and CLABSI. Predictive models were created for these outcomes using classifiers with different algorithms: logistic regression, gradient boosted trees, and deep learning.
RESULTS: There were 57,786 total hospital admissions and the mortality rate was 10.1%. There were 38.4% patients with a central line and the rate of CLABSI was 1.5%. The classifiers using deep learning performed with the highest AUC for mortality, 0.885±0.010 (p<0.01) and central line placement, 0.816±0.006 (p<0.01). The classifier using logistic regression for predicting CLABSI performed with an AUC of 0.722±0.048 (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates models for identifying patients who will develop CLABSI. Early identification of these patients has implications for quality, cost, and outcome improvements."

FOG is currently measured with scales that are typically performed by movement disorders specialists (ie. MDS-UPDRS), or through patient completed questionnaires (N-FOG-Q) both of which are inadequate in addressing the heterogeneous nature of the disorder and are unsuitable for use in clinical trials The purpose of this study was to devise a method to measure FOG objectively, hence improving our ability to identify it and accurately evaluate new therapies. We trained interpretable deep learning models with multi-task learning to simultaneously score FOG (cross-validated F1 score 97.6%), identify medication state (OFF vs. ON levodopa; cross-validated F1 score 96.8%), and measure total PD severity (MDS-UPDRS-III score prediction error ≤ 2.7 points) using kinematic data of a well-characterized sample of N=57 patients during levodopa challenge tests. The proposed model was able to identify kinematic features associated with each FOG severity level that were highly consistent with the features that movement disorders specialists are trained to identify as characteristic of freezing. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models' capability to capture complex movement patterns in kinematic data can automatically and objectively score FOG with high accuracy. These models have the potential to discover novel kinematic biomarkers for FOG that can be used for hypothesis generation and potentially as clinical trial outcome measures."

Those self-reported instruments are prone to measurement errors, which can lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of nutrient profiles. Currently, few computational methods exist to address this problem. In the present study, we introduce a deep-learning approach --- Microbiome-based nutrient profile corrector (METRIC), which leverages gut microbial compositions to correct random errors in self-reported dietary assessments using 24-hour recalls or diet records. We demonstrate the excellent performance of METRIC in minimizing the simulated random errors, particularly for nutrients metabolized by gut bacteria in both synthetic and three real-world datasets. Further research is warranted to examine the utility of METRIC to correct actual measurement errors in self-reported dietary assessment instruments."

However, the performance of existing CAD for identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXRs has been scarcely investigated. In this study, CXRs of patients with and without COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were retrospectively collected from four and one institution, respectively, and a commercialized, regulatory-approved CAD that can identify various abnormalities including pneumonia was used to analyze each CXR. Performance of the CAD was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), with reference standards of the RT-PCR results and the presence of findings of pneumonia on chest CTs obtained within 24 hours from the CXR. For comparison, 5 thoracic radiologists and 5 non-radiologist physicians independently interpreted the CXRs. Afterward, they re-interpreted the CXRs with corresponding CAD results. The performance of CAD (AUCs, 0.714 and 0.790 against RT-PCR and chest CT, respectively hereinafter) were similar with those of thoracic radiologists (AUCs, 0.701 and 0.784), and higher than those of non-radiologist physicians (AUCs, 0.584 and 0.650). Non-radiologist physicians showed significantly improved performance when assisted with the CAD (AUCs, 0.584 to 0.664 and 0.650 to 0.738). In addition, inter-reader agreement among physicians was also improved in the CAD-assisted interpretation (Fleiss' kappa coefficient, 0.209 to 0.322). In conclusion, radiologist-level performance of the CAD in identifying COVID-19 and associated pneumonia on CXR and enhanced performance of non-radiologist physicians with the CAD assistance suggest that the CAD can support physicians in interpreting CXRs and helping image-based triage of COVID-19 patients in resource-constrained environment."

We evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening in an Indian ROP telemedicine program and whether differences in ROP severity between neonatal care units (NCUs) identified by using AI are related to differences in oxygen-titrating capability.
METHODS: External validation study of an existing AI-based quantitative severity scale for ROP on a data set of images from the Retinopathy of Prematurity Eradication Save Our Sight ROP telemedicine program in India. All images were assigned an ROP severity score (1-9) by using the Imaging and Informatics in Retinopathy of Prematurity Deep Learning system. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity and specificity for treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Using multivariable linear regression, we evaluated the mean and median ROP severity in each NCU as a function of mean birth weight, gestational age, and the presence of oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity was 0.98, with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity. We found higher median (interquartile range) ROP severity in NCUs without oxygen blenders and pulse oxygenation monitors, most apparent in bigger infants (&gt;1500 g and 31 weeks' gestation: 2.7 [2.5-3.0] vs 3.1 [2.4-3.8]; P = .007, with adjustment for birth weight and gestational age).
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of AI into ROP screening programs may lead to improved access to care for secondary prevention of ROP and may facilitate assessment of disease epidemiology and NCU resources."

SSL (~3150 labeled, ~40,950 unlabeled; ~6300 labeled, ~37,800 unlabeled patches) performs significantly better than the SL. No significant difference is found between SSL (~6300 labeled, ~37,800 unlabeled) and SL (~44,100 labeled) at patch-level diagnoses (area under the curve (AUC): 0.980 ± 0.014 vs. 0.987 ± 0.008, P value = 0.134) and patient-level diagnoses (AUC: 0.974 ± 0.013 vs. 0.980 ± 0.010, P value = 0.117), which is close to human pathologists (average AUC: 0.969). The evaluation on 15,000 lung and 294,912 lymph node images also confirm SSL can achieve similar performance as that of SL with massive annotations. SSL dramatically reduces the annotations, which has great potential to effectively build expert-level pathological artificial intelligence platforms in practice."

Few clinical tools are available to identify patients at risk of these complications, which would flag them for screening tests and potentially life-saving interventions. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the ability of deep learning algorithms of longitudinal data from two prospective cohorts to predict complications resulting in death after liver transplantation over multiple timeframes, compared with logistic regression models.
METHODS: In this machine learning analysis, model development was done on a set of 42 146 liver transplant recipients (mean age 48·6 years [SD 17·3]; 17 196 [40·8%] women) from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA. Transferability of the model was further evaluated by fine-tuning on a dataset from the University Health Network (UHN) in Canada (n=3269; mean age 52·5 years [11·1]; 1079 [33·0%] women). The primary outcome was cause of death, as recorded in the databases, due to cardiovascular causes, infection, graft failure, or cancer, within 1 year and 5 years of each follow-up examination after transplantation. We compared the performance of four deep learning models against logistic regression, assessing performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
FINDINGS: In both datasets, deep learning models outperformed logistic regression, with the Transformer model achieving the highest AUROCs in both datasets (p<0·0001). The AUROC for the Transformer model across all outcomes in the SRTR dataset was 0·804 (99% CI 0·795-0·854) for 1-year predictions and 0·733 (0·729-0·769) for 5-year predictions. In the UHN dataset, the AUROC for the top-performing deep learning model was 0·807 (0·795-0·842) for 1-year predictions and 0·722 (0·705-0·764) for 5-year predictions. AUROCs ranged from 0·695 (0·680-0·713) for prediction of death from infection within 5 years to 0·859 (0·847-0·871) for prediction of death by graft failure within 1 year.
INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can incorporate longitudinal information to continuously predict long-term outcomes after liver transplantation, outperforming logistic regression models. Physicians could use these algorithms at routine follow-up visits to identify liver transplant recipients at risk for adverse outcomes and prevent these complications by modifying management based on ranked features.

Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN).
METHODS: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems."

DESIGN: Evaluation of diagnostic test or technology.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 92 eyes from 62 participants with MacTel2 from a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01949324) randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups METHODS: The ellipsoid zone (EZ) defect areas were measured on spectral domain OCT images of each eye at 2 time points (baseline and month 24) by a fully automatic, deep learning-based segmentation algorithm. The change in EZ defect area from baseline to month 24 was calculated and analyzed according to the clinical trial protocol.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in the change in EZ defect area from baseline to month 24 between the 2 treatment groups.
RESULTS: The difference in the change in EZ defect area from baseline to month 24 between the 2 treatment groups measured by the fully automatic segmentation algorithm was 0.072±0.035 mm2 (P = 0.021). This was comparable to the outcome of the clinical trial using semiautomatic measurements by expert readers, 0.065±0.033 mm2 (P = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: The fully automatic segmentation algorithm was as accurate as semiautomatic expert segmentation to assess EZ defect areas and was able to reliably reproduce the statistically significant primary outcome measure of the clinical trial. This approach, to validate the performance of an automatic segmentation algorithm on the primary clinical trial end point, provides a robust gauge of its clinical applicability."

36150046,Emotions and Topics Expressed on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom: Comparative Geolocation and Text Mining Analysis,"Alhuzali H, Zhang T, Ananiadou S.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Oct 5;24(10):e40323. doi: 10.2196/40323.,Alhuzali H,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/09/23,PMC9536769,,10.2196/40323,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought great changes to public health, society, and the economy. Social media provide a platform for people to discuss health concerns, living conditions, and policies during the epidemic, allowing policymakers to use this content to analyze the public emotions and attitudes for decision-making.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use deep learning-based methods to understand public emotions on topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom through a comparative geolocation and text mining analysis on Twitter.
METHODS: Over 500,000 tweets related to COVID-19 from 48 different cities in the United Kingdom were extracted, with the data covering the period of the last 2 years (from February 2020 to November 2021). We leveraged three advanced deep learning-based models for topic modeling to geospatially analyze the sentiment, emotion, and topics of tweets in the United Kingdom: SenticNet 6 for sentiment analysis, SpanEmo for emotion recognition, and combined topic modeling (CTM).
RESULTS: We observed a significant change in the number of tweets as the epidemiological situation and vaccination situation shifted over the 2 years. There was a sharp increase in the number of tweets from January 2020 to February 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. Then, the number of tweets gradually declined as of February 2020. Moreover, with identification of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the United Kingdom in November 2021, the number of tweets grew again. Our findings reveal people's attitudes and emotions toward topics related to COVID-19. For sentiment, approximately 60% of tweets were positive, 20% were neutral, and 20% were negative. For emotion, people tended to express highly positive emotions in the beginning of 2020, while expressing highly negative emotions over time toward the end of 2021. The topics also changed during the pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Through large-scale text mining of Twitter, our study found meaningful differences in public emotions and topics regarding the COVID-19 pandemic among different UK cities. Furthermore, efficient location-based and time-based comparative analysis can be used to track people's thoughts and feelings, and to understand their behaviors. Based on our analysis, positive attitudes were common during the pandemic; optimism and anticipation were the dominant emotions. With the outbreak and epidemiological change, the government developed control measures and vaccination policies, and the topics also shifted over time. Overall, the proportion and expressions of emojis, sentiments, emotions, and topics varied geographically and temporally. Therefore, our approach of exploring public emotions and topics on the pandemic from Twitter can potentially lead to informing how public policies are received in a particular geographical area."

The objective of our study was to characterize sudden data drift as caused by the COVID pandemic. Furthermore, we investigated the suitability of certain methods in model training to prevent model degradation caused by data drift.
METHODS: We trained different ML models with the H2O AutoML method on a dataset comprising 102,666 cases of surgical patients collected in the years 2014-2019 to predict postoperative mortality using preoperatively available data. Models applied were Generalized Linear Model with regularization, Default Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Learning and Stacked Ensembles comprising all base models. Further, we modified the original models by applying three different methods when training on the original pre-pandemic dataset: (Rahmani K, et al, Int J Med Inform 173:104930, 2023) we weighted older data weaker, (Morger A, et al, Sci Rep 12:7244, 2022) used only the most recent data for model training and (Dilmegani C, 2023) performed a z-transformation of the numerical input parameters. Afterwards, we tested model performance on a pre-pandemic and an in-pandemic data set not used in the training process, and analysed common features.
RESULTS: The models produced showed excellent areas under receiver-operating characteristic and acceptable precision-recall curves when tested on a dataset from January-March 2020, but significant degradation when tested on a dataset collected in the first wave of the COVID pandemic from April-May 2020. When comparing the probability distributions of the input parameters, significant differences between pre-pandemic and in-pandemic data were found. The endpoint of our models, in-hospital mortality after surgery, did not differ significantly between pre- and in-pandemic data and was about 1% in each case. However, the models varied considerably in the composition of their input parameters. None of our applied modifications prevented a loss of performance, although very different models emerged from it, using a large variety of parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that none of our tested easy-to-implement measures in model training can prevent deterioration in the case of sudden external events. Therefore, we conclude that, in the presence of concept drift and covariate shift, close monitoring and critical review of model predictions are necessary."

The use of mobile apps and technology for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the subject of numerous investigations, although no thorough analysis of COVID-19 pandemic prevention has been conducted using mobile apps, creating a gap.
OBJECTIVE: With the intention of helping software companies and clinical researchers, this study provides comprehensive information regarding the different fields in which mobile apps were used to diagnose COVID-19 during the pandemic.
METHODS: In this systematic review, 535 studies were found after searching 5 major research databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE). Of these, only 42 (7.9%) studies concerned with diagnosing and detecting COVID-19 were chosen after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol.
RESULTS: Mobile apps were categorized into 6 areas based on the content of these 42 studies: contact tracing, data gathering, data visualization, artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis, rule- and guideline-based diagnosis, and data transformation. Patients with COVID-19 were identified via mobile apps using a variety of clinical, geographic, demographic, radiological, serological, and laboratory data. Most studies concentrated on using AI methods to identify people who might have COVID-19. Additionally, symptoms, cough sounds, and radiological images were used more frequently compared to other data types. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, performed comparatively better in the processing of health care data than other types of AI techniques, which improved the diagnosis of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps could soon play a significant role as a powerful tool for data collection, epidemic health data analysis, and the early identification of suspected cases. These technologies can work with the internet of things, cloud storage, 5th-generation technology, and cloud computing. Processing pipelines can be moved to mobile device processing cores using new deep learning methods, such as lightweight neural networks. In the event of future pandemics, mobile apps will play a critical role in rapid diagnosis using various image data and clinical symptoms. Consequently, the rapid diagnosis of these diseases can improve the management of their effects and obtain excellent results in treating patients."

Epub 2019 Oct 22.,Hilbert A,Comput Biol Med,2019,2019/11/11,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103516,"Treatment selection is becoming increasingly more important in acute ischemic stroke patient care. Clinical variables and radiological image biomarkers (old age, pre-stroke mRS, NIHSS, occlusion location, ASPECTS, among others) have an important role in treatment selection and prognosis. Radiological biomarkers require expert annotation and are subject to inter-observer variability. Recently, Deep Learning has been introduced to reproduce these radiological image biomarkers. Instead of reproducing these biomarkers, in this work, we investigated Deep Learning techniques for building models to directly predict good reperfusion after endovascular treatment (EVT) and good functional outcome using CT angiography images. These models do not require image annotation and are fast to compute. We compare the Deep Learning models to Machine Learning models using traditional radiological image biomarkers. We explored Residual Neural Network (ResNet) architectures, adapted them with Structured Receptive Fields (RFNN) and auto-encoders (AE) for network weight initialization. We further included model visualization techniques to provide insight into the network's decision-making process. We applied the methods on the MR CLEAN Registry dataset with 1301 patients. The Deep Learning models outperformed the models using traditional radiological image biomarkers in three out of four cross-validation folds for functional outcome (average AUC of 0.71) and for all folds for reperfusion (average AUC of 0.65). Model visualization showed that the arteries were relevant features for functional outcome prediction. The best results were obtained for the ResNet models with RFNN. Auto-encoder initialization often improved the results. We concluded that, in our dataset, automated image analysis with Deep Learning methods outperforms radiological image biomarkers for stroke outcome prediction and has the potential to improve treatment selection."

Epub 2024 Mar 4.,Karabayir I,Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,2024,2024/03/06,,,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2024.101337,"BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection.
STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data.
RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77-0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91-0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81-0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93-0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence-based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data."

Its application requires highly-trained pathologists, is tedious and yet suffers from limited inter-pathologist reproducibility, especially for the intermediate Gleason score 7. Automated annotation procedures constitute a viable solution to remedy these limitations. In this study, we present a deep learning approach for automated Gleason grading of prostate cancer tissue microarrays with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Our system was trained using detailed Gleason annotations on a discovery cohort of 641 patients and was then evaluated on an independent test cohort of 245 patients annotated by two pathologists. On the test cohort, the inter-annotator agreements between the model and each pathologist, quantified via Cohen's quadratic kappa statistic, were 0.75 and 0.71 respectively, comparable with the inter-pathologist agreement (kappa = 0.71). Furthermore, the model's Gleason score assignments achieved pathology expert-level stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups, on the basis of disease-specific survival data available for the test cohort. Overall, our study shows promising results regarding the applicability of deep learning-based solutions towards more objective and reproducible prostate cancer grading, especially for cases with heterogeneous Gleason patterns."

This study aimed to develop a novel approach that combined next-generation sequencing (NGS) and machine learning algorithms using our recently published viral quasispecies (QS) analysis package. 290 HBeAg positive patients from whom liver biopsies were taken were enrolled and divided into a training group (n = 148) and a validation group (n = 142). HBV DNA was extracted and QS sequences were obtained by NGS. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) based on viral operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were performed to explore the correlations among QS and clinical phenotypes. Three machine learning algorithms, including K-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, and random forest algorithm, were used to construct diagnostic models for IT phase classification. Based on histopathology, 90 IT patients and 200 CHB patients were diagnosed. HBsAg titres for IT patients were higher than those of CHB patients (p &lt; 0.001). HCA and PCA analysis grouped IT and CHB patients into two distinct clusters. The relative abundance of viral OTUs differed mainly within the BCP/precore/core region and was significantly correlated with liver inflammation and fibrosis. For the IT phase classification, all machine-learning models showed higher AUC values compared to models based on HBsAg, APRI, and FIB-4. The relative abundance of viral OTUs reflects the severity of liver inflammation and fibrosis. The novel QS quantitative analysis approach could be used to diagnose IT patients more precisely and reduce the need for liver biopsy."

Up to date, the number of death in 2021 is more than that in 2020 globally. Here, we aimed to compare clinical characteristics of deceased patients and recovered patients, and analyze the risk factors of death to help reduce mortality of COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 2719 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 109 deceased patients and 2610 recovered patients. Medical records of all patients were collected between February 4, 2020, and April 7, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory indices, treatments, and deep-learning system- assessed lung lesion volumes were analyzed. The effect of different medications on survival time of fatal cases was also investigated. Results: The deceased patients were older (73 years versus 60 years) and had a male predominance. Nausea (10.1% versus 4.1%) and dyspnea (54.1% versus 39.2%) were more common in deceased patients. The proportion of patients with comorbidities in deceased patients was significantly higher than those in recovered patients. The median times from hospital admission to outcome in deceased patients and recovered patients were 9 days and 13 days, respectively. Patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were more frequent in deceased group. Leukocytosis (11.35×109/L versus 5.60×109/L) and lymphocytopenia (0.52×109/L versus 1.58×109/L) were shown in patients who died. The level of prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, creatine kinase, glucose, brain natriuretic peptide, and inflammatory indicators were significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The volumes of ground-glass, consolidation, total lesions and total lung in all patients were quantified. Complications were more common in deceased patients than in recovered patients; respiratory failure (57.8%), septic shock (36.7%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (26.6%) were the most common complications in patients who died. Many treatments were more frequent in deceased patients, such as antibiotic therapy (88.1% versus 53.7%), glucocorticoid treatment (70.6% versus 11.0%), intravenous immunoglobin treatment (36.6% versus 4.9%), invasive mechanical ventilation (62.3% versus 3.8%). Antivirals, antibiotics, traditional Chinese medicines and glucocorticoid treatment may significantly increase the survival time of fatal cases. Quantitative computed tomography imaging results were correlated with biochemical markers. Conclusions: Most patients with fatal outcomes were more likely to have common comorbidities. The leading causes of death were respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure and septic shock were the most common serious complications. Antivirals, antibiotics, traditional Chinese medicines, and glucocorticoid treatment may prolong the survival time of deceased patients with COVID-19."

Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a pretest probability of disease that can be used to triage patients for angiography. This review comprehensively investigates published papers in the domain of CAD detection using different AI techniques from 1991 to 2020, in order to discern broad trends and geographical differences. Moreover, key decision factors affecting CAD diagnosis are identified for different parts of the world by aggregating the results from different studies. In this study, all datasets that have been used for the studies for CAD detection, their properties, and achieved performances using various AI techniques, are presented, compared, and analyzed. In particular, the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to diagnose and predict CAD are reviewed. From PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search, 500 papers were selected to be investigated. Among these selected papers, 256 papers met our criteria and hence were included in this study. Our findings demonstrate that AI-based techniques have been increasingly applied for the detection of CAD since 2008. AI-based techniques that utilized electrocardiography (ECG), demographic characteristics, symptoms, physical examination findings, and heart rate signals, reported high accuracy for the detection of CAD. In these papers, the authors ranked the features based on their assessed clinical importance with ML techniques. The results demonstrate that the attribution of the relative importance of ML features for CAD diagnosis is different among countries. More recently, DL methods have yielded high CAD detection performance using ECG signals, which drives its burgeoning adoption."

The decision to treat is primarily based on the presence of plus disease, defined as dilation and tortuosity of retinal vessels. However, clinical diagnosis of plus disease is highly subjective and variable.
OBJECTIVE: To implement and validate an algorithm based on deep learning to automatically diagnose plus disease from retinal photographs.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A deep convolutional neural network was trained using a data set of 5511 retinal photographs. Each image was previously assigned a reference standard diagnosis (RSD) based on consensus of image grading by 3 experts and clinical diagnosis by 1 expert (ie, normal, pre-plus disease, or plus disease). The algorithm was evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation and tested on an independent set of 100 images. Images were collected from 8 academic institutions participating in the Imaging and Informatics in ROP (i-ROP) cohort study. The deep learning algorithm was tested against 8 ROP experts, each of whom had more than 10 years of clinical experience and more than 5 peer-reviewed publications about ROP. Data were collected from July 2011 to December 2016. Data were analyzed from December 2016 to September 2017.
EXPOSURES: A deep learning algorithm trained on retinal photographs.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate performance of the algorithm against the RSD. Quadratic-weighted κ coefficients were calculated for ternary classification (ie, normal, pre-plus disease, and plus disease) to measure agreement with the RSD and 8 independent experts.
RESULTS: Of the 5511 included retinal photographs, 4535 (82.3%) were graded as normal, 805 (14.6%) as pre-plus disease, and 172 (3.1%) as plus disease, based on the RSD. Mean (SD) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistics were 0.94 (0.01) for the diagnosis of normal (vs pre-plus disease or plus disease) and 0.98 (0.01) for the diagnosis of plus disease (vs normal or pre-plus disease). For diagnosis of plus disease in an independent test set of 100 retinal images, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 93% with 94% specificity. For detection of pre-plus disease or worse, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 94%, respectively. On the same test set, the algorithm achieved a quadratic-weighted κ coefficient of 0.92 compared with the RSD, outperforming 6 of 8 ROP experts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This fully automated algorithm diagnosed plus disease in ROP with comparable or better accuracy than human experts. This has potential applications in disease detection, monitoring, and prognosis in infants at risk of ROP."

Using tissue-specific 5hmC sequencing data, we introduce Deep5hmC, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates both the DNA sequence and the histone modification information to predict genome-wide 5hmC modification. The multimodal design of Deep5hmC demonstrates remarkable improvement in predicting both qualitative and quantitative 5hmC modification compared to unimodal versions of Deep5hmC and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This improvement is demonstrated through benchmarking on a comprehensive set of 5hmC sequencing data collected at four time points during forebrain organoid development and across 17 human tissues. Notably, Deep5hmC showcases its practical utility by accurately predicting gene expression and identifying differentially hydroxymethylated regions in a case-control study of Alzheimer's disease."

Predicting hospital admission in this patient group could enable timely intervention, with subsequent reduction of these admissions. To date, hospital admission prediction remains challenging. Increasing amounts of acquired data and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology allow for the creation of reliable hospital prediction algorithms for HF patients. This scoping review describes the current literature on strategies and performance of AI-based algorithms for prediction of hospital admission in patients with HF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science were used to search for articles using machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods to predict hospitalization in patients with HF. After eligibility screening, 23 articles were included. Sixteen articles predicted 30-day hospital (re-)admission resulting in an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.61 to 0.79. Six studies predicted hospital admission over longer time periods ranging from 6 months to 3 years, with AUC's ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. One study prospectively evaluated performance of a disposable sensory patch at home after hospitalization which resulted in an AUC of 0.89 for unplanned hospital admission prediction.
CONCLUSION: AI has the potential to enable prediction of hospital admission in HF patients. Improvement of data management, adding new data sources such as telemonitoring data and ML models and prospective and external validation of current models must be performed before clinical applicability is possible."

We compared predictive models developed using machine learning (ML) methods to the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS), a risk-tool developed with logistic regression for predicting serious adverse events (SAE) after emergency department (ED) disposition for syncope. We used the prospective multicenter cohort data collected for CSRS development at 11 Canadian EDs over an 8-year period to develop four ML models to predict 30-day SAE (death, arrhythmias, MI, structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage) after ED disposition. The CSRS derivation and validation cohorts were used for training and testing, respectively, and the 43 variables used included demographics, medical history, vital signs, ECG findings, blood tests and the diagnostic impression of the emergency physician. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration curves. Of the 4030 patients in the training set and 3819 patients in the test set overall, 286 (3.6%) patients suffered 30-day SAE. The AUCs for model validation in test data were CSRS 0.902 (0.877-0.926), regularized regression 0.903 (0.877-0.928), gradient boosting 0.914 (0.894-0.934), deep neural network 0.906 (0.883-0.929), simplified gradient boosting 0.904 (0.881-0.927). The AUCs and calibration slopes for the ML models and CSRS were similar. Two ML models used fewer predictors than the CSRS but matched its performance. Overall, the ML models matched the CSRS in performance, with some models using fewer predictors."

We also obtained repeat IVCM images of 12 SIV-infected animals including preinfection and 10-day post-SIV infection time points. All IVCM images were analyzed using a deep convolutional neural network architecture developed specifically for macaque studies.
RESULTS: Deep learning-based segmentation of subbasal nerves in IVCM images from macaques demonstrated that corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension measurements did not differ between species, but pigtailed macaques had significantly higher baseline corneal nerve fiber tortuosity than rhesus macaques (P = 0.005). Neither sex nor age of macaques was associated with differences in any of the assessed corneal subbasal nerve parameters. In the SIV/macaque model of human immunodeficiency virus, acute SIV infection induced significant decreases in both corneal nerve fiber length and fractal dimension (P = 0.01 and P = 0.008, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IVCM and robust objective deep learning analysis is a powerful tool to track sensory nerve damage, enabling early detection of neuropathy. Adapting deep learning analyses to clinical corneal nerve assessments will improve monitoring of small sensory nerve fiber damage in numerous clinical settings including human immunodeficiency virus."

In particular, the gut microbiota, a collection of trillions of microorganisms living in the gastrointestinal tract, is highly personalized and plays a key role in the metabolite responses to foods and nutrients. Accurately predicting metabolite responses to dietary interventions based on individuals' gut microbial compositions holds great promise for precision nutrition. Existing prediction methods are typically limited to traditional machine learning models. Deep learning methods dedicated to such tasks are still lacking. Here we develop a method McMLP (Metabolite response predictor using coupled Multilayer Perceptrons) to fill in this gap. We provide clear evidence that McMLP outperforms existing methods on both synthetic data generated by the microbial consumer-resource model and real data obtained from six dietary intervention studies. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis of McMLP to infer the tripartite food-microbe-metabolite interactions, which are then validated using the ground-truth (or literature evidence) for synthetic (or real) data, respectively. The presented tool has the potential to inform the design of microbiota-based personalized dietary strategies to achieve precision nutrition."

Epub 2024 Mar 23.,Bhattacharya D,Laryngoscope,2024,2024/03/23,,,10.1002/lary.31413,"OBJECTIVE: Computer aided diagnostics (CAD) systems can automate the differentiation of maxillary sinus (MS) with and without opacification, simplifying the typically laborious process and aiding in clinical insight discovery within large cohorts.
METHODS: This study uses Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study of participants between 45 and 74 years of age. We develop a CAD system using an ensemble of 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze cranial MRIs, distinguishing MS with opacifications (polyps, cysts, mucosal thickening) from MS without opacifications. The system is used to find correlations of participants with and without MS opacifications with clinical data (smoking, alcohol, BMI, asthma, bronchitis, sex, age, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein, allergies).
RESULTS: The evaluation metrics of CAD system (Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic: 0.95, sensitivity: 0.85, specificity: 0.90) demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. MS with opacification group exhibited higher alcohol consumption, higher BMI, higher incidence of intrinsic asthma and extrinsic asthma. Male sex had higher prevalence of MS opacifications. Participants with MS opacifications had higher incidence of hay fever and house dust allergy but lower incidence of bee/wasp venom allergy.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates a 3D CNN's ability to distinguish MS with and without opacifications, improving automated diagnosis and aiding in correlating clinical data in population studies.

Epub 2024 Apr 15.,White T,Diabetes Obes Metab,2024,2024/04/15,,,10.1111/dom.15587,"AIM: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) are major causes of morbidity and mortality, with growing burdens in low-income countries where they are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Advances in machine learning may provide opportunities to enhance diagnostics in settings with limited medical infrastructure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A non-interventional study was conducted to develop and validate a machine learning algorithm to estimate cardiovascular clinical and laboratory parameters. At two sites in Kenya, digital retinal fundus photographs were collected alongside blood pressure (BP), laboratory measures and medical history. The performance of machine learning models, originally trained using data from the UK Biobank, were evaluated for their ability to estimate BP, glycated haemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate and diagnoses from fundus images.
RESULTS: In total, 301 participants were enrolled. Compared with the UK Biobank population used for algorithm development, participants from Kenya were younger and would probably report Black/African ethnicity, with a higher body mass index and prevalence of DM and hypertension. The mean absolute error was comparable or slightly greater for systolic BP, diastolic BP, glycated haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The model trained to identify DM had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.762 (0.818 in the UK Biobank) and the hypertension model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.765 (0.738 in the UK Biobank).
CONCLUSIONS: In a Kenyan population, machine learning models estimated cardiovascular parameters with comparable or slightly lower accuracy than in the population where they were trained, suggesting model recalibration may be appropriate. This study represents an incremental step toward leveraging machine learning to make early cardiovascular screening more accessible, particularly in resource-limited settings."

Many methods have been proposed, but uncertainty exists regarding the current state of missing data addressing methods applied for EHR and which strategy performs better within specific contexts. Methods: All studies referencing EHR and missing data methods published from their inception until 2024 March 30 were searched via the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Digital Bibliography and Library Project databases. The characteristics of the included studies were extracted. We also compared the performance of various methods under different missingness scenarios. Results: After screening, 46 studies published between 2010 and 2024 were included. Three missingness mechanisms were simulated when evaluating the missing data methods: missing completely at random (29/46), missing at random (20/46), and missing not at random (21/46). Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) was the most popular statistical method, whereas generative adversarial network-based methods and the k nearest neighbor (KNN) classification were the common deep-learning-based or traditional machine-learning-based methods, respectively. Among the 26 articles comparing the performance among medical statistical and machine learning approaches, traditional machine learning or deep learning methods generally outperformed statistical methods. Med.KNN and context-aware time-series imputation performed better for longitudinal datasets, whereas probabilistic principal component analysis and MICE-based methods were optimal for cross-sectional datasets. Conclusions: Machine learning methods show significant promise for addressing missing data in EHRs. However, no single approach provides a universally generalizable solution. Standardized benchmarking analyses are essential to evaluate these methods across different missingness scenarios."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vattikuti Collective Quality Initiative is a multi-institutional dataset of patients who underwent robot-assisted partial nephectomy for kidney tumours. Machine-learning (ML) models were constructed to predict IOEs and POEs using logistic regression, random forest and neural networks. The models to predict IOEs used patient demographics and preoperative data. In addition to these, intra-operative data were used to predict POEs. Performance on the test dataset was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC).
RESULTS: The rates of IOEs and POEs were 5.62% and 20.98%, respectively. Models for predicting IOEs were constructed using data from 1690 patients and 38 variables; the best model had an AUC-ROC of 0.858 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.762, 0.936) and a PR-AUC of 0.590 (95% CI 0.400, 0.759). Models for predicting POEs were trained using data from 1406 patients and 59 variables; the best model had an AUC-ROC of 0.875 (95% CI 0.834, 0.913) and a PR-AUC 0.706 (95% CI, 0.610, 0.790).
CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the ML models in the present study was encouraging. Further validation in a multi-institutional clinical setting with larger datasets would be necessary to establish their clinical value. ML models can be used to predict significant events during and after surgery with good accuracy, paving the way for application in clinical practice to predict and intervene at an opportune time to avert complications and improve patient outcomes."

BACKGROUND: The relationship between weather and headache occurrence remains unknown.
METHODS: From a database of 1 million users, data from 4375 users with 336,951 hourly headache events and weather data from December 2020 to November 2021 were analyzed. We developed statistical and DL-based models to predict the number of hourly headache occurrences mainly from weather factors. Temporal validation was performed using data from December 2019 to November 2020. Apart from the user dataset used in this model development, the physician-diagnosed headache prevalence was gathered.
RESULTS: Of the 40,617 respondents, 15,127/40,617 (37.2%) users experienced physician-diagnosed migraine, and 2458/40,617 (6.1%) users had physician-diagnosed non-migraine headaches. The mean (standard deviation) age of the 4375 filtered users was 34 (11.2) years, and 89.2% were female (3902/4375). Lower barometric pressure (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 3.9), higher humidity (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 7.1), more rainfall (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 3.1), a significant decrease in barometric pressure 6 h before (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 11.7), higher barometric pressure at 6:00 a.m. on the day (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 4.6), lower barometric pressure on the next day (p &lt; 0.001, gain = 6.7), and raw time-series barometric type I (remaining low around headache attack, p &lt; 0.001, gain = 10.1) and type II (decreasing around headache attack, p &lt; 0.001, gain = 10.1) changes over 6 days, were significantly associated with headache occurrences in both the statistical and DL-based models. For temporal validation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 13.4, and the determination coefficient (R2 ) was 52.9% for the statistical model. The RMSE was 10.2, and the R2 was 53.7% for the DL-based model.
CONCLUSIONS: Using big data, we found that low barometric pressure, barometric pressure changes, higher humidity, and rainfall were associated with an increased number of headache occurrences."

However, AI based risk prediction models that account for right-censored data have been overlooked. This systematic review (PROSPERO protocol CRD42023492655) includes 33 studies that utilised machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for survival outcome in CVD prediction. We provided details on the employed ML and DL models, eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques, and type of included variables, with a focus on social determinants of health (SDoH) and gender-stratification. Approximately half of the studies were published in 2023 with the majority from the United States. Random Survival Forest (RSF), Survival Gradient Boosting models, and Penalised Cox models were the most frequently employed ML models. DeepSurv was the most frequently employed DL model. DL models were better at predicting CVD outcomes than ML models. Permutation-based feature importance and Shapley values were the most utilised XAI methods for explaining AI models. Moreover, only one in five studies performed gender-stratification analysis and very few incorporate the wide range of SDoH factors in their prediction model. In conclusion, the evidence indicates that RSF and DeepSurv models are currently the optimal models for predicting CVD outcomes. This study also highlights the better predictive ability of DL survival models, compared to ML models. Future research should ensure the appropriate interpretation of AI models, accounting for SDoH, and gender stratification, as gender plays a significant role in CVD occurrence."

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in scientific databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar based on the PRISMA statement. Two independent reviewers assessed all potential publications on AI and KCN up to March 2022. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) 11-item checklist was used to evaluate the validity of the studies. Eligible articles were categorized into three groups (KCN, SKCN, and FFKCN) and included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of accuracy (PEA) was calculated for all selected articles.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 575 relevant publications, of which 36 met the CASP quality criteria and were included in the analysis. Qualitative assessment showed that Scheimpflug and Placido combined with biomechanical and wavefront evaluations improved KCN detection (PEA, 99.2, and 99.0, respectively). The Scheimpflug system (92.25 PEA, 95% CI, 94.76-97.51) and a combination of Scheimpflug and Placido (96.44 PEA, 95% CI, 93.13-98.19) had the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of SKCN and FFKCN, respectively. The meta-analysis outcomes showed no significant difference between the CASP score and accuracy of the publications (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous Scheimpflug and Placido corneal imaging methods provide high diagnostic accuracy for early detection of keratoconus. The use of AI models improves the discrimination of keratoconic eyes from normal corneas."

In this review, after outlining the journey from computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems to AI applied to digital mammography (DM), we summarize the results of studies where AI was applied to DBT, noting that long-term advantages of DBT screening and its crucial ability to decrease the interval cancer rate are still under scrutiny. AI has shown the capability to overcome some shortcomings of DBT in the screening setting by improving diagnostic performance and by reducing recall rates (from -2 % to -27 %) and reading times (up to -53 %, with an average 20 % reduction), but the ability of AI to reduce interval cancer rates has not yet been clearly investigated. Prospective validation is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and real-world impact of AI models assisting DBT interpretation, especially in large-scale studies with low breast cancer prevalence. Finally, we focus on the incoming era of personalized and risk-stratified screening that will first see the application of contrast-enhanced breast imaging to screen women with extremely dense breasts. As the diagnostic advantage of DBT over DM was concentrated in this category, we try to understand if the application of AI to DM in the remaining cohorts of women with heterogeneously dense or non-dense breast could close the gap in diagnostic performance between DM and DBT, thus neutralizing the usefulness of AI application to DBT."

Our goal was to determine objective differences in the diagnosis of plus disease between clinicians using an automated retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) vascular severity score.
DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Imaging and Informatics in ROP Consortium, which comprises 8 tertiary care centers in North America. Fundus photographs of all infants undergoing ROP screening examinations between July 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016, were obtained.
PARTICIPANTS: Infants meeting ROP screening criteria who were diagnosed with plus disease and treatment initiated by an examining physician based on ophthalmoscopic examination results.
METHODS: An ROP severity score (1-9) was generated for each image using a deep learning (DL) algorithm.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean, median, and range of ROP vascular severity scores overall and for each examiner when the diagnosis of plus disease was made.
RESULTS: A total of 5255 clinical examinations in 871 babies were analyzed. Of these, 168 eyes were diagnosed with plus disease by 11 different examiners and were included in the study. The mean ± standard deviation vascular severity score for patients diagnosed with plus disease was 7.4 ± 1.9, median was 8.5 (interquartile range, 5.8-8.9), and range was 1.1 to 9.0. Within some examiners, variability in the level of vascular severity diagnosed as plus disease was present, and 1 examiner routinely diagnosed plus disease in patients with less severe disease than the other examiners (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed variability both between and within examiners in the diagnosis of plus disease using DL. Prospective evaluation of clinical trial data using an objective measurement of vascular severity may help to define better the minimum necessary level of vascular severity for the diagnosis of plus disease or how other clinical features such as zone, stage, and extent of peripheral disease ought to be incorporated in treatment decisions."

The detection of plus disease, a severe form of ROP requiring treatment, remains challenging owing to subjectivity, frequency, and time intensity of retinal examinations. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms developed to detect plus disease aims to alleviate these challenges; however, they have not been tested against a diverse neonatal population. Our study aims to validate ROP.AI, an AI algorithm developed from a single cohort, against a multicenter Australian cohort to determine its performance in detecting plus disease.
METHODS: Retinal images captured during routine ROP screening from May 2021 to February 2022 across five major tertiary centers throughout Australia were collected and uploaded to ROP.AI. AI diagnostic output was compared with one of five ROP experts. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operator curve were determined.
RESULTS: We collected 8052 images. The area under the receiver operator curve for the diagnosis of plus disease was 0.75. ROP.AI achieved 84% sensitivity, 43% specificity, and 96% negative predictive value for the detection of plus disease after operating point optimization.
CONCLUSIONS: ROP.AI was able to detect plus disease in an external, multicenter cohort despite being trained from a single center. Algorithm performance was demonstrated without preprocessing or augmentation, simulating real-world clinical applicability. Further training may improve generalizability for clinical implementation.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: These results demonstrate ROP.AI's potential as a screening tool for the detection of plus disease in future clinical practice and provides a solution to overcome current diagnostic challenges."

A retrospective multicenter study was conducted on COVID-19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in China from Jan 17, 2020, to Feb 17, 2020. Clinical presentation, laboratory data, and quantitative CT parameters were also collected. The result showed that increasing risks of ICU admission were associated with age &gt; 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 12.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.42-24.61; P = 0.032), coexisting conditions (OR, 5.55; 95% CI, 1.59-19.38; P = 0.007) and CT derived total opacity percentage (TOP) (OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.45-39.29; P = 0.016). In conclusion, older age, coexisting conditions, larger TOP at the time of hospital admission are associated with ICU admission in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Early monitoring the progression of the disease and implementing appropriate therapies are warranted."

Coronary artery calcium (CAC), a strong independent CVD risk factor, can be automatically quantified on radiotherapy planning computed tomography (CT) scans and may help identify patients at increased CVD risk.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of CAC with CVD and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter cohort study of 15 915 patients with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy between 2005 and 2016 who were followed until December 31, 2018, age, calendar year, and treatment-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association of CAC with CVD and CAD.
EXPOSURES: Overall CAC scores were automatically extracted from planning CT scans using a deep learning algorithm. Patients were classified into Agatston risk categories (0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-399, >400 units).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Occurrence of fatal and nonfatal CVD and CAD were obtained from national registries.
RESULTS: Of the 15 915 participants included in this study, the mean (SD) age at CT scan was 59.0 (11.2; range, 22-95) years, and 15 879 (99.8%) were women. Seventy percent (n = 11 179) had no CAC. Coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and greater than 400 were present in 10.0% (n = 1584), 11.5% (n = 1825), 5.2% (n = 830), and 3.1% (n = 497) respectively. After a median follow-up of 51.2 months, CVD risks increased from 5.2% in patients with no CAC to 28.2% in patients with CAC scores higher than 400. After adjustment, CVD risk increased with higher CAC score (hazard ratio [HR]CAC = 1-10 = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4; HRCAC = 11-100 = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1; HRCAC = 101-400 = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.6; and HRCAC>400 = 3.4; 95% CI, 2.8-4.2). Coronary artery calcium was particularly strongly associated with CAD (HRCAC>400 = 7.8; 95% CI, 5.5-11.2). The association between CAC and CVD was strongest in patients treated with anthracyclines (HRCAC>400 = 5.8; 95% CI, 3.0-11.4) and patients who received a radiation boost (HRCAC>400 = 6.1; 95% CI, 3.8-9.7).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that coronary artery calcium on breast cancer radiotherapy planning CT scan results was associated with CVD, especially CAD. Automated CAC scoring on radiotherapy planning CT scans may be used as a fast and low-cost tool to identify patients with breast cancer at increased risk of CVD, allowing implementing CVD risk-mitigating strategies with the aim to reduce the risk of CVD burden after breast cancer.

The study is aimed at understanding the etiology, progression, and heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition to genetic analysis, the participants have been extensively characterized by clinical questionnaires, spirometry, volumetric inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography, and longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up computed tomography at 5 years after enrollment. The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to summarize the major advances in our understanding of COPD resulting from the imaging findings in the COPDGene study. Imaging features that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes include early interstitial lung abnormalities, visual presence and pattern of emphysema, the ratio of pulmonary artery to ascending aortic diameter, quantitative evaluation of emphysema, airway wall thickness, and expiratory gas trapping. COPD is characterized by the early involvement of the small conducting airways, and the addition of expiratory scans has enabled measurement of small airway disease. Computational advances have enabled indirect measurement of nonemphysematous gas trapping. These metrics have provided insights into the pathogenesis and prognosis of COPD and have aided early identification of disease. Important quantifiable extrapulmonary findings include coronary artery calcification, cardiac morphology, intrathoracic and extrathoracic fat, and osteoporosis. Current active research includes identification of novel quantitative measures for emphysema and airway disease, evaluation of dose reduction techniques, and use of deep learning for phenotyping COPD."

We developed, trained, and validated an artificial-intelligence-based ""Automated Visual Evaluation"" (AVE) tool that can be adapted to run on smartphones to assess smartphone-captured images of the cervix and identify precancerous lesions, helping augment VIA performance.
DESIGN: Prospective study.
SETTING: Eight public health facilities in Zambia.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8204 women aged 25-55.
INTERVENTIONS: Cervical images captured on commonly used low-cost smartphone models were matched with key clinical information including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) status, plus histopathology analysis (where applicable), to develop and train an AVE algorithm and evaluate its performance for use as a primary screen and triage test for women who are HPV positive.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC); sensitivity; specificity.
RESULTS: As a general population screening tool for cervical precancerous lesions, AVE identified cases of cervical precancerous and cancerous (CIN2+) lesions with high performance (AUC = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89-0.93), which translates to a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI = 81%-90%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI = 84%-88%) based on maximizing the Youden's index. This represents a considerable improvement over naked eye VIA, which as per a meta-analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) has a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 87%. For women living with HIV, the AUC of AVE was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.88-0.93), and among those testing positive for high-risk HPV types, the AUC was 0.87 (95% CI = 0.83-0.91).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing AVE on images captured using a commonly available smartphone by nurses in a screening program, and support our ongoing efforts for moving to more broadly evaluate AVE for its clinical sensitivity, specificity, feasibility, and acceptability across a wider range of settings. Limitations of this study include potential inflation of performance estimates due to verification bias (as biopsies were only obtained from participants with visible aceto-white cervical lesions) and due to this being an internal validation (the test data, while independent from that used to develop the algorithm was drawn from the same study)."

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study utilizing harmonized intensive care data from four public datasets.
SETTING: ICUs across Europe and the United States.
PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to the ICU for at least 6 hours who had good data quality.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using carefully harmonized data from a total of 334,812 ICU stays, we systematically assessed the transferability of DL models for three common adverse events: death, acute kidney injury (AKI), and sepsis. We tested whether using more than one data source and/or algorithmically optimizing for generalizability during training improves model performance at new hospitals. We found that models achieved high area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for mortality (0.838-0.869), AKI (0.823-0.866), and sepsis (0.749-0.824) at the training hospital. As expected, AUROC dropped when models were applied at other hospitals, sometimes by as much as -0.200. Using more than one dataset for training mitigated the performance drop, with multicenter models performing roughly on par with the best single-center model. Dedicated methods promoting generalizability did not noticeably improve performance in our experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the importance of diverse training data for DL-based risk prediction. They suggest that as data from more hospitals become available for training, models may become increasingly generalizable. Even so, good performance at a new hospital still depended on the inclusion of compatible hospitals during training."

The aim of this review is to outline the differences between the American and European guidelines and to show how they have arisen. Furthermore, it will provide insight into the future of SCD risk prediction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The American SCD risk prediction method has high sensitivity but limited specificity, whereas the European method has the opposite. These differences in sensitivity and specificity likely contribute to the fact that primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator utilization is twofold higher in the United States. It is highly likely that new insights and new imaging modalities will enhance prediction models in the near future. Genotyping could potentially assume a significant role. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain was recently shown to be an independent predictor of SCD. Furthermore, after late gadolinium enhancement, additional cardiac magnetic resonance techniques such as T1 mapping and diffusion tensor imaging are showing encouraging outcomes in predicting SCD. Ultimately, it is conceivable that integrating diverse morphological and genetic characteristics through deep learning will yield novel insights and enhance SCD prediction methods."

Diagnosis of this complication of DM is time-consuming and not routinely performed in the clinical practice, in contrast to fundus retinal imaging which is accessible and routinely performed. Whether artificial intelligence (AI) utilizing retinal images collected through diabetic eye screening can provide an efficient diagnostic method for CAN is unknown.
METHODS: This was a single center, observational study in a cohort of patients with DM as a part of the Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Diabetes: The Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project (NCT05626413). To diagnose CAN, we used standard CV autonomic reflex tests. In this analysis we implemented AI-based deep learning techniques with non-mydriatic 5-field color fundus imaging to identify patients with CAN. Two experiments have been developed utilizing Multiple Instance Learning and primarily ResNet 18 as the backbone network. Models underwent training and validation prior to testing on an unseen image set.
RESULTS: In an analysis of 2275 retinal images from 229 patients, the ResNet 18 backbone model demonstrated robust diagnostic capabilities in the binary classification of CAN, correctly identifying 93% of CAN cases and 89% of non-CAN cases within the test set. The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-0.97). For distinguishing between definite or severe stages of CAN (dsCAN), the ResNet 18 model accurately classified 78% of dsCAN cases and 93% of cases without dsCAN, with an AUCROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86-1.00). An alternate backbone model, ResWide 50, showed enhanced sensitivity at 89% for dsCAN, but with a marginally lower AUCROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.73-1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-based algorithms utilising retinal images can differentiate with high accuracy patients with CAN. AI analysis of fundus images to detect CAN may be implemented in routine clinical practice to identify patients at the highest CV risk.

Clinically acquired computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used for quantification of body composition, but manual analysis is laborious and costly. The primary aim of this study was to develop an automated body composition analysis framework using CT scans.
METHODS: CT scans of the 3rd lumbar vertebrae from critically ill, liver cirrhosis, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients, as well as renal and liver donors, were manually analyzed for body composition. Ninety percent of scans were used for developing and validating a neural network for the automated segmentation of skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Network accuracy was evaluated with the remaining 10 percent of scans using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which quantifies the overlap (0 = no overlap, 1 = perfect overlap) between human and automated segmentations.
RESULTS: Of the 893 patients, 44% were female, with a mean (±SD) age and body mass index of 52.7 (±15.8) years old and 28.0 (±6.1) kg/m2, respectively. In the testing cohort (n = 89), DSC scores indicated excellent agreement between human and network-predicted segmentations for skeletal muscle (0.983 ± 0.013), and intermuscular (0.900 ± 0.034), visceral (0.979 ± 0.019), and subcutaneous (0.986 ± 0.016) adipose tissue. Network segmentation took ~350 milliseconds/scan using modern computing hardware.
CONCLUSIONS: Our network displayed excellent ability to analyze diverse body composition phenotypes and clinical cohorts, which will create feasible opportunities to advance our capacity to predict health outcomes in clinical populations."

However, at present, it has limited treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission.
METHODS: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions.
RESULTS: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients' outcomes."

To mitigate the impact of sensitivity to self-excitement (i.e., fickle media interest) and other artifacts of online social media data, in our approach we fuse multiple offline and online data sources.
METHODS: Four individual models: generalized linear model (GLM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and deep learning (DL) with Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) are employed to forecast ILI-GOPC both one week and two weeks in advance. The covariates include Google search queries, meteorological data, and previously recorded offline ILI. To our knowledge, this is the first study that introduces deep learning methodology into surveillance of infectious diseases and investigates its predictive utility. Furthermore, to exploit the strength from each individual forecasting models, we use statistical model fusion, using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), which allows a systematic integration of multiple forecast scenarios. For each model, an adaptive approach is used to capture the recent relationship between ILI and covariates.
RESULTS: DL with FNN appears to deliver the most competitive predictive performance among the four considered individual models. Combing all four models in a comprehensive BMA framework allows to further improve such predictive evaluation metrics as root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE). Nevertheless, DL with FNN remains the preferred method for predicting locations of influenza peaks.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach can be viewed a feasible alternative to forecast ILI in Hong Kong or other countries where ILI has no constant seasonal trend and influenza data resources are limited. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient."

Substantial variation has been observed in pathologists' classification of colorectal polyps, and improved assessment by pathologists may be associated with reduced subsequent underuse and overuse of colonoscopy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare standard microscopic assessment with an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented digital system that annotates regions of interest within digitized polyp tissue and predicts polyp type using a deep learning model to assist pathologists in colorectal polyp classification.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this diagnostic study conducted at a tertiary academic medical center and a community hospital in New Hampshire, 100 slides with colorectal polyp samples were read by 15 pathologists using a microscope and an AI-augmented digital system, with a washout period of at least 12 weeks between use of each modality. The study was conducted from February 10 to July 10, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Accuracy and time of evaluation were used to compare pathologists' performance when a microscope was used with their performance when the AI-augmented digital system was used. Outcomes were compared using paired t tests and mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: In assessments of 100 slides with colorectal polyp specimens, use of the AI-augmented digital system significantly improved pathologists' classification accuracy compared with microscopic assessment from 73.9% (95% CI, 71.7%-76.2%) to 80.8% (95% CI, 78.8%-82.8%) (P < .001). The overall difference in the evaluation time per slide between the digital system (mean, 21.7 seconds; 95% CI, 20.8-22.7 seconds) and microscopic examination (mean, 13.0 seconds; 95% CI, 12.4-13.5 seconds) was -8.8 seconds (95% CI, -9.8 to -7.7 seconds), but this difference decreased as pathologists became more familiar and experienced with the digital system; the difference between the time of evaluation on the last set of 20 slides for all pathologists when using the microscope and the digital system was 4.8 seconds (95% CI, 3.0-6.5 seconds).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, an AI-augmented digital system significantly improved the accuracy of pathologic interpretation of colorectal polyps compared with microscopic assessment. If applied broadly to clinical practice, this tool may be associated with decreases in subsequent overuse and underuse of colonoscopy and thus with improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs."

This comprehensive research study aims to provide a thorough understanding of the role of control charts in healthcare quality monitoring and future perspectives by utilizing a dual methodology approach involving a systematic review and a pioneering bibliometric analysis. A systematic review of 73 out of 223 articles was conducted, synthesizing existing literature (1995-2023) and revealing insights into key trends, methodological approaches, and emerging themes of control charts in healthcare. In parallel, a bibliometric analysis (1990-2023) on 184 articles gathered from Web of Science and Scopus was performed, quantitatively assessing the scholarly landscape encompassing control charts in healthcare. Among 25 countries, the USA is the foremost user of control charts, accounting for 33% of all applications, whereas among 14 health departments, epidemiology leads with 28% of applications. The practice of control charts in health monitoring has increased by more than one-third during the last 3 years. Globally, exponentially weighted moving average charts are the most popular, but interestingly the USA remained the top user of Shewhart charts. The study also uncovers a dynamic landscape in healthcare quality monitoring, with key contributors, research networks, research hotspot tendencies, and leading countries. Influential authors, such as J.C. Benneyan, W.H. Woodall, and M.A. Mohammed played a leading role in this field. In-countries networking, USA-UK leads the largest cluster, while other clusters include Denmark-Norway-Sweden, China-Singapore, and Canada-South Africa. From 1990 to 2023, healthcare monitoring evolved from studying efficiency to focusing on conditional monitoring and flowcharting, with human health, patient safety, and health surveys dominating 2011-2020, and recent years emphasizing epidemic control, COronaVIrus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) statistical process control, hospitals, and human health monitoring using control charts. It identifies a transition from conventional to artificial intelligence approaches, with increasing contributions from machine learning and deep learning in the context of Industry 4.0. New researchers and journals are emerging, reshaping the academic context of control charts in healthcare. Our research reveals the evolving landscape of healthcare quality monitoring, surpassing traditional reviews. We uncover emerging trends, research gaps, and a transition in leadership from established contributors to newcomers amidst technological advancements. This study deepens the importance of control charts, offering insights for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to enhance healthcare quality.

Since its emergence, the highly virulent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 10 million people, leading to over 500,000 deaths as of July 1st, 2020. Since the outbreak began, almost 28,000 articles about COVID-19 have been published (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); however, few have explored the role of imaging and artificial intelligence in COVID-19 patients-specifically, those with comorbidities. This paper begins by presenting the four pathways that can lead to heart and brain injuries following a COVID-19 infection. Our survey also offers insights into the role that imaging can play in the treatment of comorbid patients, based on probabilities derived from COVID-19 symptom statistics. Such symptoms include myocardial injury, hypoxia, plaque rupture, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, coronary thrombosis, encephalitis, ischemia, inflammation, and lung injury. At its core, this study considers the role of image-based AI, which can be used to characterize the tissues of a COVID-19 patient and classify the severity of their infection. Image-based AI is more important than ever as the pandemic surges and countries worldwide grapple with limited medical resources for detection and diagnosis."

Few ML studies have examined percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) outcomes. Our objective was to build, streamline, temporally validate, and use ML models for prediction of PCNL outcomes (intensive care admission, postoperative infection, transfusion, adjuvant treatment, postoperative complications, visceral injury, and stone-free status at follow-up) using a comprehensive national database (British Association of Urological Surgeons PCNL).
METHODS: This was an ML study using data from a prospective national database. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB), deep neural network (DNN), and logistic regression (LR) models were built for each outcome of interest using complete cases only, imputed, and oversampled and imputed/oversampled data sets. All validation was performed with complete cases only. Temporal validation was performed with 2019 data only. A second round used a composite of the most important 11 variables in each model to build the final model for inclusion in the shiny application. We report statistics for prognostic accuracy.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The database contains 12 810 patients. The final variables included were age, Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative haemoglobin, Guy's stone score, stone location, size of outer sheath, preoperative midstream urine result, primary puncture site, preoperative dimercapto-succinic acid scan, stone size, and image guidance (https://endourology.shinyapps.io/PCNL_Demographics/). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was >0.6 in all cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is the largest ML study on PCNL outcomes to date. The models are temporally valid and therefore can be implemented in clinical practice for patient-specific risk profiling. Further work will be conducted to externally validate the models.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We applied artificial intelligence to data for patients who underwent a keyhole surgery to remove kidney stones and developed a model to predict outcomes for this procedure. Doctors could use this tool to advise patients about their risk of complications and the outcomes they can expect after this surgery."

METHODS: Seventy five older adults with sarcopenia aged 60-75 from community organizations in Changchun city were randomly divided into a face-to-face traditional training group (TRHG), a general remote training group (GTHG), and an AI-based remote training group (AITHG). All groups underwent a 3-month program consisting of 24-form Taichi exercises, with a frequency of 3 sessions per week and each session lasting 40 min. The participants underwent Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass Index (ASMI), grip strength, 6-meter walking pace, Timed Up and Go test (TUGT), and quality of life score (QoL) tests before the experiment, during the mid-term, and after the experiment. This study used SPSS26.0 software to perform one-way ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA tests to compare the differences among the three groups. A significance level of p < 0.05 was defined as having significant difference, while p < 0.01 was defined as having a highly significant difference.
RESULTS: (1) The comparison between the mid-term and pre-term indicators showed that TRHG experienced significant improvements in ASMI, 6-meter walking pace, and QoL (p < 0.01), and a significant improvement in TUGT timing test (p < 0.05); GTHG experienced extremely significant improvements in 6-meter walking pace and QoL (p < 0.01); AITHG experienced extremely significant improvements in ASMI, 6-meter walking pace, and QoL (p < 0.01), and a significant improvement in TUGT timing test (p < 0.05). (2) The comparison between the post-term and pre-term indicators showed that TRHG experienced extremely significant improvements in TUGT timing test (p < 0.01); GTHG experienced significant improvements in ASMI and TUGT timing test (p < 0.05); and AITHG experienced extremely significant improvements in TUGT timing test (p < 0.01). (3) During the mid-term, there was no significant difference among the groups in all tests (p > 0.05). The same was in post-term tests (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Compared to the pre-experiment, there was no significant difference at the post- experiment in the recovery effects on the muscle quality, physical activity ability, and life quality of patients with sarcopenia between the AI-based remote training group and the face-to-face traditional training group. 3D pose estimation is equally as effective as traditional rehabilitation methods in enhancing muscle quality, functionality and life quality in older adults with sarcopenia.

We aimed at developing a machine-learning model to optimize colonic adenoma detection in a prospective cohort.
METHODS: All consecutive adult patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy were enrolled between October 2020 and November 2022. Patients with a high risk of colonic adenoma were excluded. The predictive model was developed using the gradient-boosting machine (GBM)-learning method. The GBM model was optimized further by adjusting the learning rate and the number of trees and 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: Total 10,320 patients (mean age 45.18 ± 14.82 years; 69% men) were included in the study. In the overall population, 1152 (11.2%) patients had at least one adenoma. In patients with age > 50 years, hospital-based adenoma prevalence was 19.5% (808/4144). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) (SD) of the logistic regression model was 72.55% (4.91), while the AUCs for deep learning, decision tree, random forest and gradient-boosted tree model were 76.25% (4.22%), 65.95% (4.01%), 79.38% (4.91%) and 84.76% (2.86%), respectively. After model optimization and cross-validation, the AUC of the gradient-boosted tree model has increased to 92.2% (1.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning models may predict colorectal adenoma more accurately than logistic regression. A machine-learning model may help optimize the use of colonoscopy to prevent colorectal cancers.

The aim of the study was to validate an artificial intelligence-enabled DR screening and to investigate the prevalence of DR in adult patients with diabetes in China.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was prospectively conducted at 155 diabetes centers in China. A non-mydriatic, macula-centered fundus photograph per eye was collected and graded through a deep learning (DL)-based, five-stage DR classification. Images from a randomly selected one-third of participants were used for the DL algorithm validation.
RESULTS: In total, 47 269 patients (mean (SD) age, 54.29 (11.60) years) were enrolled. 15 805 randomly selected participants were reviewed by a panel of specialists for DL algorithm validation. The DR grading algorithms had a 83.3% (95% CI: 81.9% to 84.6%) sensitivity and a 92.5% (95% CI: 92.1% to 92.9%) specificity to detect referable DR. The five-stage DR classification performance (concordance: 83.0%) is comparable to the interobserver variability of specialists (concordance: 84.3%). The estimated prevalence in patients with diabetes detected by DL algorithm for any DR, referable DR and vision-threatening DR were 28.8% (95% CI: 28.4% to 29.3%), 24.4% (95% CI: 24.0% to 24.8%) and 10.8% (95% CI: 10.5% to 11.1%), respectively. The prevalence was higher in female, elderly, longer diabetes duration and higher glycated hemoglobin groups.
CONCLUSION: This study performed, a nationwide, multicenter, DL-based DR screening and the results indicated the importance and feasibility of DR screening in clinical practice with this system deployed at diabetes centers.

We propose DeepAutoCoV, an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system to predict future dominant lineages (FDLs). We define FDLs as viral (sub)lineages that will constitute more than 10% of all the viral sequences added to the GISAID database on a given week. DeepAutoCoV is trained and validated by assembling global and country-specific data sets from over 16 million Spike protein sequences sampled over a period of about 4 years. DeepAutoCoV successfully flags FDLs at very low frequencies (0.01% - 3%), with median lead times of 4-17 weeks, and predicts FDLs ~5 and ~25 times better than a baseline approach For example, the B.1.617.2 vaccine reference strain was flagged as FDL when its frequency was only 0.01%, more than a year before it was considered for an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, DeepAutoCoV outputs interpretable results by pinpointing specific mutations potentially linked to increased fitness, and may provide significant insights for the optimization of public health pre-emptive intervention strategies."

Nevertheless, this well-known association does not provide any practical information on how much weight loss in a given period would reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in individuals in a personalized setting. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model for metabolic syndrome in 2 years, based on an individual's baseline health status and body weight after 2 years. We recruited 3,447 and 3,874 participants from the Ansan and Anseong cohorts of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, respectively. Among the former, 8636 longitudinal observations of 2,412 participants (70%) and 3,570 of 1,034 (30%) were used for training and internal validation, respectively. Among the latter, all 15,739 observations of 3,874 participants were used for external validation.

Imaging signatures of the underlying genome (radiogenomics) in glioblastoma patients may serve as preoperative biomarkers of the tumor-host immune apparatus. Validated biomarkers would have the potential to stratify patients during immunotherapy clinical trials, and if trials are beneficial, facilitate personalized neo-adjuvant treatment. The increased use of whole genome sequencing data, and the advances in bioinformatics and machine learning make such developments plausible. We performed a systematic review to determine the extent of development and validation of immune-related radiogenomic biomarkers for glioblastoma.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases. Qualitative analysis was performed by incorporating the QUADAS 2 tool and CLAIM checklist. PROSPERO registered: CRD42022340968. Extracted data were insufficiently homogenous to perform a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Nine studies, all retrospective, were included. Biomarkers extracted from magnetic resonance imaging volumes of interest included apparent diffusion coefficient values, relative cerebral blood volume values, and image-derived features. These biomarkers correlated with genomic markers from tumor cells or immune cells or with patient survival. The majority of studies had a high risk of bias and applicability concerns regarding the index test performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiogenomic immune biomarkers have the potential to provide early treatment options to patients with glioblastoma. Targeted immunotherapy, stratified by these biomarkers, has the potential to allow individualized neo-adjuvant precision treatment options in clinical trials. However, there are no prospective studies validating these biomarkers, and interpretation is limited due to study bias with little evidence of generalizability."

Analysis of these publications was used to identify and make estimates for how resources allocated to ophthalmology in public health systems in Trinidad and Tobago can be more efficiently utilized by employing AI in diagnosing treatable DR. DR screening was found to be an effective method of detecting the disease. Screening was found to be a universally cost-effective method of disease prevention and for altering the natural history of the disease in the spectrum of low-middle to high-income economies, such as Rwanda, Thailand, China, South Korea, and Singapore. AI and deep learning systems were found to be clinically superior to, or as effective as, human graders in areas where they were deployed, indicating that the systems are clinically safe. They have been shown to improve access to diabetic retinal screening, improve compliance with screening appointments, and prove to be cost-effective, especially in rural areas. Trinidad and Tobago, which is estimated to be disproportionately more affected by the burden of DR when projected out to the mid-21st century, stands to save as much as US$60 million annually from the implementation of an AI-based system to screen for DR versus conventional manual grading."

We integrated lung CT features measured via deep learning with clinical and laboratory data in spontaneously breathing subjects to enhance the identification of COVID-19 subphenotypes.
METHODS: This is a multicenter observational cohort study in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure exposed to early lung CT within 7 days of admission. We explored lung CT images using deep learning approaches to quantitative and qualitative analyses; latent class analysis (LCA) by using clinical, laboratory and lung CT variables; regional differences between subphenotypes following 3D spatial trajectories.
RESULTS: Complete datasets were available in 559 patients. LCA identified two subphenotypes (subphenotype 1 and 2). As compared with subphenotype 2 (n = 403), subphenotype 1 patients (n = 156) were older, had higher inflammatory biomarkers, and were more hypoxemic. Lungs in subphenotype 1 had a higher density gravitational gradient with a greater proportion of consolidated lungs as compared with subphenotype 2. In contrast, subphenotype 2 had a higher density submantellar-hilar gradient with a greater proportion of ground glass opacities as compared with subphenotype 1. Subphenotype 1 showed higher prevalence of comorbidities associated with endothelial dysfunction and higher 90-day mortality than subphenotype 2, even after adjustment for clinically meaningful variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating lung-CT data in a LCA allowed us to identify two subphenotypes of COVID-19, with different clinical trajectories. These exploratory findings suggest a role of automated imaging characterization guided by machine learning in subphenotyping patients with respiratory failure.

METHODS: We included 372 patients with ToF who had undergone CMR imaging as part of a nationwide prospective study. Cine loops were retrieved and subjected to automatic deep learning (DL)-based image analysis, trained on independent, local CMR data, to derive measures of cardiac dimensions and function. This information was combined with established clinical parameters and ECG markers of prognosis.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 10 years, 23 patients experienced an endpoint of death/aborted cardiac arrest or documented ventricular tachycardia (defined as >3 documented consecutive ventricular beats). On univariate Cox analysis, various DL parameters, including right atrial median area (HR 1.11/cm², p=0.003) and right ventricular long-axis strain (HR 0.80/%, p=0.009) emerged as significant predictors of outcome. DL parameters were related to adverse outcome independently of left and right ventricular ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake (p<0.05 for all). A composite score of enlarged right atrial area and depressed right ventricular longitudinal function identified a ToF subgroup at significantly increased risk of adverse outcome (HR 2.1/unit, p=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: We present data on the utility of machine learning algorithms trained on external imaging datasets to automatically estimate prognosis in patients with ToF. Due to the automated analysis process these two-dimensional-based algorithms may serve as surrogates for labour-intensive manually attained imaging parameters in patients with ToF."

Muscle size can be extracted from computed tomography (CT) scans, but clinical implementation will require increased automation. We hypothesize that we can achieve this by using artificial intelligence.
METHODS: Using deep convolutional neural networks, we trained an algorithm on the Reference Analytic Morphomics Population (n = 5,268) and validated the automated methodology in an external cohort of adult kidney donors with a noncontrast CT scan (n = 1,655). To test the clinical usefulness, we examined its ability to predict clinical outcomes in a prospectively followed cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed cirrhosis (n = 254).
RESULTS: Between the manual and automated methodologies, we found excellent inter-rater agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.957 (confidence interval 0.953-0.961, P < 0.0001) in the adult kidney donor cohort. The calculated dice similarity coefficient was 0.932 ± 0.042, suggesting excellent spatial overlap between manual and automated methodologies. To assess the clinical usefulness, we examined its ability to predict clinical outcomes in a cirrhosis cohort and found that automated psoas muscle index was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for age, gender, and child's classification (P < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that deep learning techniques can allow for automation of muscle measurements on clinical CT scans in a diseased cohort. These automated psoas size measurements were predictive of mortality in patients with cirrhosis showing proof of principal that this methodology may allow for wider implementation in the clinical arena."
33232368,Deep-learning algorithms for the interpretation of chest radiographs to aid in the triage of COVID-19 patients: A multicenter retrospective study,"Jang SB, Lee SH, Lee DE, Park SY, Kim JK, Cho JW, Cho J, Kim KB, Park B, Park J, Lim JK.",PLoS One. 2020 Nov 24;15(11):e0242759. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0242759. eCollection 2020.,Jang SB,PLoS One,2020,2020/11/24,PMC7685476,,10.1371/journal.pone.0242759,"The recent medical applications of deep-learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated their clinical efficacy in improving speed and accuracy of image interpretation. If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations."

Materials and Methods A deep learning AI algorithm was developed and validated for DBT with retrospectively collected examinations (January 2010 to December 2021) from 14 institutions in the United States and South Korea. A multicenter reader study was performed to compare the performance of 15 radiologists (seven breast specialists, eight general radiologists) in interpreting DBT examinations in 258 women (mean age, 56 years ± 13.41 [SD]), including 65 cancer cases, with and without the use of AI. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were evaluated. Results The AUC for stand-alone AI performance was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.94). With AI, radiologists' AUC improved from 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.93) to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.96) (P = .003) in the reader study. AI showed higher specificity (89.64% [95% CI: 85.34%, 93.94%]) than radiologists (77.34% [95% CI: 75.82%, 78.87%]) (P &lt; .001). When reading with AI, radiologists' sensitivity increased from 85.44% (95% CI: 83.22%, 87.65%) to 87.69% (95% CI: 85.63%, 89.75%) (P = .04), with no evidence of a difference in specificity. Reading time decreased from 54.41 seconds (95% CI: 52.56, 56.27) without AI to 48.52 seconds (95% CI: 46.79, 50.25) with AI (P &lt; .001). Interreader agreement measured by Fleiss κ increased from 0.59 to 0.62. Conclusion The AI model showed better diagnostic accuracy than radiologists in breast cancer detection, as well as reduced reading times. The concurrent use of AI in DBT interpretation could improve both accuracy and efficiency.

Identifying features associated with aging is essential for designing robust intervention strategies and discovering novel biomarkers of aging. Extensive studies at both the molecular and organ/whole-body physiological scales have helped determined features associated with aging. However, the lack of meso-scale studies, particularly at the tissue level, limits the ability to translate findings made at molecular scale to impaired tissue functions associated with aging. In this work, we established a tissue image analysis workflow - quantitative micro-anatomical phenotyping (qMAP) - that leverages deep learning and machine vision to fully label tissue and cellular compartments in tissue sections. The fully mapped tissue images address the challenges of finding an interpretable feature set to quantitatively profile age-related microanatomic changes. We optimized qMAP for skin tissues and applied it to a cohort of 99 donors aged 14 to 92. We extracted 914 microanatomic features and found that a broad spectrum of these features, represented by 10 cores processes, are strongly associated with aging. Our analysis shows that microanatomical features of the skin can predict aging with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.7 years, comparable to state-of-the-art epigenetic clocks. Our study demonstrates that tissue-level architectural changes are strongly associated with aging and represent a novel category of aging biomarkers that complement molecular markers. Our results highlight the complex and underexplored multi-scale relationship between molecular and tissue microanatomic scales."

For 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymphomas, obtaining complete metabolic response (CMR) by end of treatment is prognostic.
METHODS: Here, we present a deep learning-based algorithm for fully automated treatment response assessments according to the Lugano 2014 classification. The proposed four-stage method, trained on a multicountry clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01287741) and tested in three independent multicenter and multicountry test sets on different non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes and different lines of treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02257567, NCT02500407; 20% holdout in ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01287741), outputs the detected lesions at baseline and follow-up to enable focused radiologist review.
RESULTS: The method's response assessment achieved high agreement with the adjudicated radiologic responses (eg, agreement for overall response assessment of 93%, 87%, and 85% in ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01287741, NCT02500407, and NCT02257567, respectively) similar to inter-radiologist agreement and was strongly prognostic of outcomes with a trend toward higher accuracy for death risk than adjudicated radiologic responses (hazard ratio for end of treatment by-model CMR of 0.123, 0.054, and 0.205 in ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01287741, NCT02500407, and NCT02257567, compared with, respectively, 0.226, 0.292, and 0.272 for CMR by the adjudicated responses). Furthermore, a radiologist review of the algorithm's assessments was conducted. The radiologist median review time was 1.38 minutes/assessment, and no statistically significant differences were observed in the level of agreement of the radiologist with the model's response compared with the level of agreement of the radiologist with the adjudicated responses.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the proposed method can be incorporated into radiologic response assessment workflows in cancer imaging for significant time savings and with performance similar to trained medical experts."

At the same time, 140 normal singleton pregnant women were selected as the control group. The hemodynamic indexes were detected by color Doppler ultrasound. The CNN algorithm was used to classify ultrasound images of two groups of pregnant women. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mean pixel accuracy (MPA), and mean intersection of union (MIOU) values of CNN algorithm were 0.9410, 0.9228, and 0.8968, respectively. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were 93.44%, 95.13%, 95.09%, and 94.87%, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the normal control group, the umbilical artery (UA), uterine artery-systolic/diastolic (UTA-S/D), uterine artery (UTA), and digital video (DV) of pregnant women in the observation group were remarkably increased; the minimum alveolar effective concentration (MCA) of the observation group was obviously lower than the MCA of the control group, and the differences between groups were statistically valid (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that UA-S/D, UA-resistance index (UA-RI), UTA-S/D, UTA-pulsatility index (UTA-PI), DV-peak velocity index for veins (DV-PVIV), and MCA-S/D were independent risk factors for the outcome of perinatal children with severe preeclampsia. In the perinatal management of severe epilepsy, the combination of the above blood flow indexes to select the appropriate delivery time had positive significance to improve the pregnancy outcome and reduce the perinatal mortality."

To identify genetic loci affecting kidney function, we performed a GWAS using multiple kidney function biomarkers and identified 462 loci. To begin to investigate how these loci affect kidney function, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) maps of the human kidney and identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) for kidney podocytes, tubule epithelial cells, and kidney endothelial, stromal, and immune cells. Kidney tubule epithelial cCREs explained 58% of kidney function SNP-heritability and kidney podocyte cCREs explained an additional 6.5% of SNP-heritability. In contrast, little kidney function heritability was explained by kidney endothelial, stromal, or immune cell-specific cCREs. Through functionally informed fine-mapping, we identified putative causal kidney function variants and their corresponding cCREs. Using kidney scATAC-seq data, we created a deep learning model (which we named ChromKid) to predict kidney cell type-specific chromatin accessibility from sequence. ChromKid and allele specific kidney scATAC-seq revealed that many fine-mapped kidney function variants locally change chromatin accessibility in tubule epithelial cells. Enhancer assays confirmed that fine-mapped kidney function variants alter tubule epithelial regulatory element function. To map the genes which these regulatory elements control, we used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to target these regulatory elements in tubule epithelial cells and assessed changes in gene expression. CRISPRi of enhancers harboring kidney function variants regulated NDRG1 and RBPMS expression. Thus, inherited differences in tubule epithelial NDRG1 and RBPMS expression may predispose to kidney disease in humans. We conclude that genetic variants affecting tubule epithelial regulatory element function account for most SNP-heritability of human kidney function. This work provides an experimental approach to identify the variants, regulatory elements, and genes involved in polygenic disease."

METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective international registry comprising 109 consecutive patients (age 64 ± 16 years; 62% male) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and noncontrast chest CT imaging. Using semi-automated software, we quantified the burden (%) of lung abnormalities associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. EAT volume (mL) and attenuation (Hounsfield units) were measured using deep learning software. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy) or in-hospital death.
RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression analysis adjusted for patient comorbidities, the total burden of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with EAT volume (β = 10.6, p = 0.005) and EAT attenuation (β = 5.2, p = 0.004). EAT volume correlated with serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (r = 0.361, p = 0.001) and C-reactive protein (r = 0.450, p < 0.001). Clinical deterioration or death occurred in 23 (21.1%) patients at a median of 3 days (IQR 1-13 days) following the chest CT. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, EAT volume (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.8-14.1] per doubling p = 0.011) and EAT attenuation (OR 3.4 [95% CI 1.5-7.5] per 5 Hounsfield unit increase, p = 0.003) were independent predictors of clinical deterioration or death, as was total pneumonia burden (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, p = 0.002), chronic lung disease (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7], p = 0.011), and history of heart failure (OR 3.5 [95% 1.1-8.2], p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: EAT measures quantified from chest CT are independently associated with extent of pneumonia and adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19, lending support to their use in clinical risk stratification."

In this study, we automatically identify vulnerable older adult patients with geriatric syndrome based on clinical notes extracted from an EHR system, and demonstrate how contextual information can improve the process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture to identify sentences that contain geriatric syndromes. Our model learns a representation of the sentence and augments it with contextual information: surrounding sentences, the entire clinical document, and the diagnosis codes associated with the document. We trained our system on annotated notes from 85 patients, tuned the model on another 50 patients, and evaluated its performance on the rest, 50 patients.
RESULTS: Contextual information improved classification, with the most effective context coming from the surrounding sentences. At sentence level, our best performing model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.605, significantly outperforming context-free baselines. At patient level, our best model achieved a micro-F1 of 0.843.
DISCUSSION: Our solution can be used to expand the identification of vulnerable older adults with geriatric syndromes. Since functional and social factors are often not captured by diagnosis codes in EHRs, the automatic identification of the geriatric syndrome can reduce disparities by ensuring consistent care across the older adult population.
CONCLUSION: EHR free-text can be used to identify vulnerable older adults with a range of geriatric syndromes."

In this work, various Deep CNN based approaches are explored for detecting the presence of COVID19 from chest CT images. A decision fusion based approach is also proposed, which combines predictions from multiple individual models, to produce a final prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed decision fusion based approach is able to achieve above 86% results across all the performance metrics under consideration, with average AUROC and F1-Score being 0.883 and 0.867, respectively. The experimental observations suggest the potential applicability of such Deep CNN based approach in real diagnostic scenarios, which could be of very high utility in terms of achieving fast testing for COVID19."

Despite the prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak, relatively few diagnostic images are openly available to develop automatic diagnosis algorithms. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle when data is highly unbalanced with many cases in one class and only a few cases in another; new methods must be developed to overcome this challenge. We propose a novel activation function based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution from extreme value theory, which improves performance over the traditional sigmoid activation function when one class significantly outweighs the other. We demonstrate the proposed activation function on a publicly available dataset and externally validate on a dataset consisting of 1,909 healthy chest X-rays and 84 COVID-19 X-rays. The proposed method achieves an improved area under the receiver operating characteristic (DeLong's p-value < 0.05) compared to the sigmoid activation. Our method is also demonstrated on a dataset of healthy and pneumonia vs. COVID-19 X-rays and a set of computerized tomography images, achieving improved sensitivity. The proposed GEV activation function significantly improves upon the previously used sigmoid activation for binary classification. This new paradigm is expected to play a significant role in the fight against COVID-19 and other diseases, with relatively few training cases available."

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are artificial intelligent techniques to achieve high modeling power. The application of DNNs to large-scale data for estimating stroke risk needs to be assessed and validated. This study aims to apply a DNN for deriving a stroke predictive model using a big electronic health record database.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database was used to conduct a retrospective population-based study. The database was divided into one development dataset for model training (~70% of total patients for training and ~10% for parameter tuning) and two testing datasets (each ~10%). A total of 11,192,916 claim records from 840,487 patients were used. The primary outcome was defined as any ischemic stroke in inpatient records within 3 years after study enrollment. The DNN was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC or c-statistic). The development dataset included 672,214 patients (a total of 8,952,000 records) of whom 2,060 patients had stroke events. The mean age of the population was 35.5±20.2 years, with 48.5% men. The model achieved AUC values of 0.920 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.908-0.932) in testing dataset 1 and 0.925 (95% CI, 0.914-0.937) in testing dataset 2. Under a high sensitivity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.5% and 79.8% for testing dataset 1; 91.8% and 79.9% for testing dataset 2. Under a high specificity operating point, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.3% and 87.5% for testing dataset 1; 83.7% and 87.5% for testing dataset 2. The DNN model maintained high predictability 5 years after being developed. The model achieved similar performance to other clinical risk assessment scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a DNN algorithm on this large electronic health record database is capable of obtaining a high performing model for assessment of ischemic stroke risk. Further research is needed to determine whether such a DNN-based IDSS could lead to an improvement in clinical practice."

We herewith evaluate the ability of a DL model, showing excellent performance on a Korean data set, to generalse onto an American data set despite ethnic differences. In addition, expert graders were surveyed to verify if the DL model was appropriately identifying lesions indicative of nAMD on the OCT scans.
METHODS: Model development data set-12 247 OCT scans from South Korea; external validation data set-91 509 OCT scans from Washington, USA. In both data sets, normal eyes or eyes with nAMD were included. After internal testing, the algorithm was sent to the University of Washington, USA, for external validation. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were calculated. For model explanation, saliency maps were generated using Guided GradCAM.
RESULTS: On external validation, AUC and AUPRC remained high at 0.952 (95% CI 0.942 to 0.962) and 0.891 (95% CI 0.875 to 0.908) at the individual level. Saliency maps showed that in normal OCT scans, the fovea was the main area of interest; in nAMD OCT scans, the appropriate pathological features were areas of model interest. Survey of 10 retina specialists confirmed this.
CONCLUSION: Our DL algorithm exhibited high performance for nAMD identification in a Korean population, and generalised well to an ethnically distinct, American population. The model correctly focused on the differences within the macular area to extract features associated with nAMD."

We combined the CNN model score and the selected epidemiological risk factors, and a risk prediction nomogram was presented. An independent multicenter cohort was used for model external validation. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect to its calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: The final hybrid model included the CNN model score and the screened risk factors included age, gender, smoking status and family history of cancer. The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration with an area under the curve (AUC) of 91.6% (95% CI: 89.4%-93.5%), compare with the CNN model, the improvement was significance. The performance of the nomogram still showed good discrimination and good calibration in the multicenter validation cohort, with an AUC of 88.3% (95% CI: 83.1%-92.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that epidemiological characteristics should be considered in lung cancer screening, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the artificial intelligence (AI) model alone. We combined the CNN model score with Asian lung cancer epidemiological characteristics to develop a new nomogram to facilitate and accurately perform individualized lung cancer screening, especially for Asians."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, patients with previously diagnosed TB were enrolled. Photographs of their CXRs were taken using a consumer-grade digital still camera. The images were stratified by pathological patterns into classes: cavity, consolidation, effusion, interstitial changes, miliary pattern or normal examination. Image analysis was performed with commercially available Deep Learning software in two steps. Pathological areas were first localised; detected areas were then classified. Detection was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and classification using a confusion matrix.
RESULTS: The study cohort was 138 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB co-infection (median age 34 years, IQR 28-40); 54 patients were female. Localisation of pathological areas was excellent (area under the ROC curve 0.82). The software could perfectly distinguish pleural effusions from intraparenchymal changes. The most frequent misclassifications were consolidations as cavitations, and miliary patterns as interstitial patterns (and vice versa).
CONCLUSION: Deep Learning analysis of CXR photographs is a promising tool. Further efforts are needed to build larger, high-quality data sets to achieve better diagnostic performance."

The goal of UCSF REACH is to define cLBP phenotypes and pain mechanisms that can lead to effective, personalized treatments for patients across the population. The primary objective of this research project is to address the critical need for new diagnostic and prognostic markers, and associated patient classification protocols for chronic low back pain (cLBP) treatment.
DESIGN: To meet this objective, REACH is conducting two large investigator-initiated translational research cohort studies called: The Longitudinal Clinical Cohort for Comprehensive Deep Phenotyping of Chronic Low-Back Pain (cLBP) Adults Study (comeBACK) and the Chronic Low-Back Pain (cLBP) in Adults Study (BACKHOME).
SETTING: comeBACK is a longitudinal multicenter in-person observational study of 450 adults with chronic low back pain designed to perform comprehensive deep phenotyping. While, the BACKHOME study is a site-less longitudinal observational e-cohort of approximately 3000 U.S. adults with cLBP. To our knowledge, BACKHOME is the largest prospective remote registry of nationwide adults with cLBP.
METHODS: Both the comeBACK and BACKHOME studies are collecting a robust and comprehensive set of risk factors, outcomes, and covariates in order to perform deep phenotyping of cLBP patients based on combined biopsychosocial variables to: define cLBP subtypes, establish phenotyping tools for routine clinical evaluation, and lead to improved cLBP outcomes in the future. The data from both studies will be used to establish techniques to develop a patient-centric definition of treatment success and to analyze cLBP patient traits to define clinically useful cLBP phenotypes, using a combination of traditional data analyses and deep learning methods.
CONCLUSIONS: These 2 pivotal studies, in conjunction with the ancillary studies being performed in both comeBACK and BACKHOME, and the other BACPAC-consortium research projects, we will be able to address a number of diagnostic and therapeutic issues in this complex and diverse patient population with cLBP. These studies will help clarify biopsychosocial mechanisms of cLBP with the aim to provide a foundation to improve the evaluation of treatment effectiveness and to spur new avenues of therapeutic research, including personalized outcome measures that constitute a clinically meaningful treatment effect for individual cLBP patients."
38997109,Use of automated assessment for determining associations of low muscle mass and muscle loss with overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer - A validation study,"Smit KC, Derksen JWG, Kurk SA, Moeskops P, Koopman M, Veldhuis WB, May AM.",Clin Nutr ESPEN. 2024 Oct;63:572-584. doi: 10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.07.001. Epub 2024 Jul 10.,Smit KC,Clin Nutr ESPEN,2024,2024/07/12,,,10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.07.001,"BACKGROUND: Low muscle mass and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) loss are associated with adverse patient outcomes, but the time-consuming nature of manual SMM quantification prohibits implementation of this metric in clinical practice. Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of automated SMM quantification compared to manual quantification. We evaluated both diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass and associations of SMM (change) with survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
METHODS: Computed tomography (CT) images from CRC patients enrolled in two clinical studies were analyzed. We compared i) manual vs. automated segmentation of preselected slices at the third lumbar [L3] vertebra (""semi-automated""), and ii) manual L3-slice-selection + manual segmentation vs. automated L3-slice-selection + automated segmentation (""fully-automated""). Automated L3-selection and automated segmentation was performed with Quantib Body Composition v0.2.1. Bland-Altman analyses, within-subject coefficients of variation (WSCVs) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to evaluate the agreement between manual and automatic segmentation. Diagnostic accuracy for low muscle mass (defined by an established sarcopenia cut-off) was calculated with manual assessment as the ""gold standard"". Using either manual or automated assessment, Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were used to study the association between changes in SMM (>5% decrease yes/no) during first-line metastatic CRC treatment and mortality adjusted for prognostic factors. SMM change was also assessed separately in weight-stable (<5%, i.e. occult SMM loss) patients.
RESULTS: In total, 1580 CT scans were analyzed, while a subset of 307 scans were analyzed in the fully-automated comparison. Included patients (n = 553) had a mean age of 63 ± 9 years and 39% were female. The semi-automated comparison revealed a bias of -2.41 cm2, 95% limits of agreement [-9.02 to 4.20], a WSCV of 2.25%, and an ICC of 0.99 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.97 to 1.00). The fully-automated comparison method revealed a bias of -0.08 cm2 [-10.91 to 10.75], a WSCV of 2.85% and an ICC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98 to 0.99). Sensitivity and specificity for low muscle mass were 0.99 and 0.89 for the semi-automated comparison and 0.96 and 0.90 for the fully-automated comparison. SMM decrease was associated with shorter survival in both manual and automated assessment (n = 78/280, HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.80] and n = 89/280, HR 1.38 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.81]). Occult SMM loss was associated with shorter survival in manual assessment, but not significantly in automated assessment (n = 44/263, HR 1.43 [95% CI 1.01 to 2.03] and n = 51/2639, HR 1.23 [95% CI 0.87 to 1.74]).
CONCLUSION: Deep-learning based assessment of SMM at L3 shows reliable performance, enabling the use of CT measures to guide clinical decision making. Implementation in clinical practice helps to identify patients with low muscle mass or (occult) SMM loss who may benefit from lifestyle interventions."

Epub 2024 Jul 20.,Chin V,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),2024,2024/08/03,,,10.1016/j.clon.2024.07.005,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is increasingly used for early-stage lung cancer, however the impact of dose to the heart and cardiac substructures remains largely unknown. The study investigated doses received by cardiac substructures in SABR patients and impact on survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SSBROC is an Australian multi-centre phase II prospective study of SABR for stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Patients were treated between 2013 and 2019 across 9 centres. In this secondary analysis of the dataset, a previously published and locally developed open-source hybrid deep learning cardiac substructure automatic segmentation tool was deployed on the planning CTs of 117 trial patients. Physical doses to 18 cardiac structures and EQD2 converted doses (α/β = 3) were calculated. Endpoints evaluated include pericardial effusion and overall survival. Associations between cardiac doses and survival were analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Cardiac structures that received the highest physical mean doses were superior vena cava (22.5 Gy) and sinoatrial node (18.3 Gy). The highest physical maximum dose was received by the heart (51.7 Gy) and right atrium (45.3 Gy). Three patients developed grade 2, and one grade 3 pericardial effusion. The cohort receiving higher than median mean heart dose (MHD) had poorer survival compared to those who received below median MHD (p = 0.00004). On multivariable Cox analysis, male gender and maximum dose to ascending aorta were significant for worse survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with lung SABR may receive high doses to cardiac substructures. Dichotomising the patients according to median mean heart dose showed a clear difference in survival. On multivariable analyses gender and dose to ascending aorta were significant for survival, however cardiac substructure dosimetry and outcomes should be further explored in larger studies."

Although the key role of ORF34 within the vPIC and its function as a hub protein have been recognized, further clarification regarding its specific contribution to vPIC functionality and interactions with other components is required. This study employed a deep-learning algorithm-assisted structural model of ORF34, revealing highly conserved amino acid residues across human beta- and gamma-herpesviruses localized in structured domains. Thus, we engineered ORF34 alanine-scanning mutants by substituting conserved residues with alanine. These mutants were evaluated for their ability to interact with other vPIC factors and restore viral production in cells harboring the ORF34-deficient KSHV-BAC. Our experimental results highlight the crucial role of the 4 cysteine residues conserved in ORF34: a tetrahedral arrangement consisting of a pair of C-X<sub>n</sub>-C consensus motifs. This suggests the potential incorporation of metal cations in interacting with ORF24 and ORF66 vPIC components, facilitating late gene transcription, and promoting overall virus production by capturing metal cations. In summary, our findings underline the essential role of conserved cysteines in KSHV ORF34 for effective vPIC assembly and viral replication, thereby enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between the vPIC components."

In cases of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), the presence of ventriculomegaly is often neuroradiologically evaluated by visual rating and manually measuring each image. Previously, we have developed and tested a deep-learning-model that utilizes transfer learning from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CT-based intracranial tissue segmentation. Accordingly, herein we aimed to enhance the segmentation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (VCSF) in brain CT scans and assess the performance of automated brain CT volumetrics in iNPH patient diagnostics.
METHODS: The development of the model used a two-stage approach. Initially, a 2D U-Net model was trained to predict VCSF segmentations from CT scans, using paired MR-VCSF labels from healthy controls. This model was subsequently refined by incorporating manually segmented lateral CT-VCSF labels from iNPH patients, building on the features learned from the initial U-Net model. The training dataset included 734 CT datasets from healthy controls paired with T1-weighted MRI scans from the Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Studies and 62 CT scans from iNPH patients at Uppsala University Hospital. To validate the model's performance across diverse patient populations, external clinical images including scans of 11 iNPH patients from the Universitatsmedizin Rostock, Germany, and 30 iNPH patients from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, United States were used. Further, we obtained three CT-based volumetric measures (CTVMs) related to iNPH.
RESULTS: Our analyses demonstrated strong volumetric correlations (ϱ=0.91, p<0.001) between automatically and manually derived CT-VCSF measurements in iNPH patients. The CTVMs exhibited high accuracy in differentiating iNPH patients from controls in external clinical datasets with an AUC of 0.97 and in the Uppsala University Hospital datasets with an AUC of 0.99.
DISCUSSION: CTVMs derived through deep learning, show potential for assessing and quantifying morphological features in hydrocephalus. Critically, these measures performed comparably to gold-standard neuroradiology assessments in distinguishing iNPH from healthy controls, even in the presence of intraventricular shunt catheters. Accordingly, such an approach may serve to improve the radiological evaluation of iNPH diagnosis/monitoring (i.e., treatment responses). Since CT is much more widely available than MRI, our results have considerable clinical impact."

The choice of strategy is based on heterogeneous biomarkers that can dynamically change during therapy. Thus, there is a compelling need to identify comprehensive biomarkers that can be used longitudinally to help guide therapy choice. Herein, we report a 18F-FDG-PET/CT-based deep learning model, which demonstrates high accuracy in EGFR mutation status prediction across patient cohorts from different institutions. A deep learning score (EGFR-DLS) was significantly and positively associated with longer progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, while EGFR-DLS is significantly and negatively associated with higher durable clinical benefit, reduced hyperprogression, and longer PFS among patients treated with ICIs. Thus, the EGFR-DLS provides a non-invasive method for precise quantification of EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients, which is promising to identify NSCLC patients sensitive to EGFR-TKI or ICI-treatments."

However, it is unclear whether distinguishing the origin should rely solely on PVC or incorporate sinus rhythm (SR). We compared the dual-rhythm model (incorporating both SR and PVC) to the PVC model (using PVC alone) and quantified the contribution of each ECG lead in predicting the PVC origin for each cardiac rotation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicentre study enrolled 593 patients from 11 centres-493 from Japan and Germany, and 100 from Belgium, which were used as the external validation data set. Using a hybrid approach combining a Resnet50-based convolutional neural network and a transformer model, we developed two variants-the PVC and dual-rhythm models-to predict PVC origin. In the external validation data set, the dual-rhythm model outperformed the PVC model in accuracy (0.84 vs. 0.74, respectively; P < 0.01), precision (0.73 vs. 0.55, respectively; P < 0.01), specificity (0.87 vs. 0.68, respectively; P < 0.01), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.91 vs. 0.86, respectively; P = 0.03), and F1-score (0.77 vs. 0.68, respectively; P = 0.03). The contributions to PVC origin prediction were 77.3% for PVC and 22.7% for the SR. However, in patients with counterclockwise rotation, SR had a greater contribution in predicting the origin of right-sided PVC.
CONCLUSION: Our deep learning-based model, incorporating both PVC and SR morphologies, resulted in a higher prediction accuracy for PVC origin, considering SR is particularly important for predicting right-sided origin in patients with counterclockwise rotation."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially reliable assistant for the medical imaging recognition. We systematically review articles on the diagnostic performance of AI in OC from medical imaging for the first time.
METHODS: The Medline, Embase, IEEE, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library databases were searched for related studies published until August 1, 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies that developed or used AI algorithms in the diagnosis of OC from medical images. The binary diagnostic accuracy data were extracted to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study was registered with the PROSPERO, CRD42022324611.
FINDINGS: Thirty-four eligible studies were identified, of which twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis with a pooled SE of 88% (95%CI: 85-90%), SP of 85% (82-88%), and AUC of 0.93 (0.91-0.95). Analysis for different algorithms revealed a pooled SE of 89% (85-92%) and SP of 88% (82-92%) for machine learning; and a pooled SE of 88% (84-91%) and SP of 84% (80-87%) for deep learning. Acceptable diagnostic performance was demonstrated in subgroup analyses stratified by imaging modalities (Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Computed Tomography), sample size (≤300 or >300), AI algorithms versus clinicians, year of publication (before or after 2020), geographical distribution (Asia or non Asia), and the different risk of bias levels (≥3 domain low risk or < 3 domain low risk).

Studies are inconsistent in the use of the term ""validation"", with some using it to refer to tuning and others testing, which hinders accurate delivery of information and may inadvertently exaggerate the performance of DL algorithms. We investigated the extent of inconsistency in usage of the term ""validation"" in studies on the accuracy of DL algorithms in providing diagnosis from medical imaging.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed the full texts of research papers cited in two recent systematic reviews. The papers were categorized according to whether the term ""validation"" was used to refer to tuning alone, both tuning and testing, or testing alone. We analyzed whether paper characteristics (i.e., journal category, field of study, year of print publication, journal impact factor [JIF], and nature of test data) were associated with the usage of the terminology using multivariable logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations. Of 201 papers published in 125 journals, 118 (58.7%), 9 (4.5%), and 74 (36.8%) used the term to refer to tuning alone, both tuning and testing, and testing alone, respectively. A weak association was noted between higher JIF and using the term to refer to testing (i.e., testing alone or both tuning and testing) instead of tuning alone (vs. JIF <5; JIF 5 to 10: adjusted odds ratio 2.11, P = 0.042; JIF >10: adjusted odds ratio 2.41, P = 0.089). Journal category, field of study, year of print publication, and nature of test data were not significantly associated with the terminology usage.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature has a significant degree of inconsistency in using the term ""validation"" when referring to the steps in DL algorithm development. Efforts are needed to improve the accuracy and clarity in the terminology usage."

METHODS: HCC patients who underwent HR between 2000-2020 were identified from a multi-institutional database. NTR was defined as recurrence beyond Milan Criteria. Different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques were used to develop and validate two prediction models for NTR, one using only preoperative factors and a second using both preoperative and postoperative factors.
RESULTS: Overall, 1763 HCC patients were included. Among 877 patients with recurrence, 364 (41.5%) patients developed NTR. An ensemble AI model demonstrated the highest area under ROC curves (AUC) of 0.751 (95% CI: 0.719-0.782) and 0.717 (95% CI:0.653-0.782) in the training and testing cohorts, respectively which improved to 0.858 (95% CI: 0.835-0.884) and 0.764 (95% CI: 0.704-0.826), respectively after incorporation of postoperative pathologic factors. Radiologic tumor burden score and pathological microvascular invasion were the most important preoperative and postoperative factors, respectively to predict NTR. Patients predicted to develop NTR had overall 1- and 5-year survival of 75.6% and 28.2%, versus 93.4% and 55.9%, respectively, among patients predicted to not develop NTR (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The AI preoperative model may help inform decision of HR versus LT for HCC, while the combined AI model can frame individualized postoperative care (https://altaf-pawlik-hcc-ntr-calculator.streamlit.app/)."

OBJECTIVE: We examined the utility of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that analyzes printed electrocardiograms (ECGs) for outcome prediction in patients with acute HF.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of patients with acute HF at two tertiary centers in Korea. Baseline ECGs were analyzed using a deep-learning system called Quantitative ECG (QCG), which was trained to detect several urgent clinical conditions, including shock, cardiac arrest, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
RESULTS: Among the 1254 patients enrolled, in-hospital cardiac death occurred in 53 (4.2%) patients, and the QCG score for critical events (QCG-Critical) was significantly higher in these patients than in survivors (mean 0.57, SD 0.23 vs mean 0.29, SD 0.20; P<.001). The QCG-Critical score was an independent predictor of in-hospital cardiac death after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, HF etiology/type, atrial fibrillation, and QRS widening (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.47-1.92 per 0.1 increase; P<.001), and remained a significant predictor after additional adjustments for echocardiographic LVEF and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide level (adjusted OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.36-1.87 per 0.1 increase; P<.001). During long-term follow-up, patients with higher QCG-Critical scores (>0.5) had higher mortality rates than those with low QCG-Critical scores (<0.25) (adjusted hazard ratio 2.69, 95% CI 2.14-3.38; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Predicting outcomes in patients with acute HF using the QCG-Critical score is feasible, indicating that this AI-based ECG score may be a novel biomarker for these patients.

In this scoping review, we aimed to present an overview of the current literature available on the applicability of AI within the field of IHD. The literature search resulted in eighteen articles in which an AI model was trained and tested, mostly for diagnostic and predictive purposes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.78-0.96, but varied between IHD types, used methods and outcome measures. Only three out of eighteen did perform validation on an external dataset and most studies did not use explainable deep learning models. To be able to integrate AI as a tool to aid physicians in their diagnoses and clinical decisions within the IHD field, generalizability has to be better evaluated and explainability of DL models has to be increased."

METHODS: Retrospective and prospective data were collected from 206 consecutive glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase -wildtype patients diagnosed between March 2014 and February 2022 across 11 UK centers. Models were trained on 158 retrospective patients from 3 centers. Holdout test sets were retrospective (n = 19; internal validation), and prospective (n = 29; external validation from 8 distinct centers). Neural network branches for T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted inputs were concatenated to predict survival. A nonimaging branch (demographics/MGMT/treatment data) was also combined with the imaging model. We investigated the influence of individual MR sequences; nonimaging features; and weighted dense blocks pretrained for abnormality detection.
RESULTS: The imaging model outperformed the nonimaging model in all test sets (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, AUC P = .038) and performed similarly to a combined imaging/nonimaging model (P > .05). Imaging, nonimaging, and combined models applied to amalgamated test sets gave AUCs of 0.93, 0.79, and 0.91. Initializing the imaging model with pretrained weights from 10 000s of brain MRIs improved performance considerably (amalgamated test sets without pretraining 0.64; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model using MRI images after radiotherapy reliably and accurately determined survival of glioblastoma. The model serves as a prognostic biomarker identifying patients who will not survive beyond a typical course of adjuvant temozolomide, thereby stratifying patients into those who might require early second-line or clinical trial treatment."

In 2013, there were just 1200 neurologists in India for a population of 1.3 billion people; in Africa, the average population per neurologist exceeds 3.3 million people. In contrast, 60,000 people receive a diagnosis of PD every year in the United States alone, and similar patterns of rising PD cases-fueled mostly by environmental pollution and an aging population-can be seen worldwide. The current projection of more than 12 million patients with PD worldwide by 2040 is only part of the picture given that more than 20% of patients with PD remain undiagnosed. Timely diagnosis and frequent assessment are key to ensure timely and appropriate medical intervention, thus improving the quality of life of patients with PD.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a web-based framework that can help anyone anywhere around the world record a short speech task and analyze the recorded data to screen for PD.
METHODS: We collected data from 726 unique participants (PD: 262/726, 36.1% were women; non-PD: 464/726, 63.9% were women; average age 61 years) from all over the United States and beyond. A small portion of the data (approximately 54/726, 7.4%) was collected in a laboratory setting to compare the performance of the models trained with noisy home environment data against high-quality laboratory-environment data. The participants were instructed to utter a popular pangram containing all the letters in the English alphabet, ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" We extracted both standard acoustic features (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and jitter and shimmer variants) and deep learning-based embedding features from the speech data. Using these features, we trained several machine learning algorithms. We also applied model interpretation techniques such as Shapley additive explanations to ascertain the importance of each feature in determining the model's output.
RESULTS: We achieved an area under the curve of 0.753 for determining the presence of self-reported PD by modeling the standard acoustic features through the XGBoost-a gradient-boosted decision tree model. Further analysis revealed that the widely used mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features and a subset of previously validated dysphonia features designed for detecting PD from a verbal phonation task (pronouncing ""ahh"") influence the model's decision the most.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model performed equally well on data collected in a controlled laboratory environment and in the wild across different gender and age groups. Using this tool, we can collect data from almost anyone anywhere with an audio-enabled device and help the participants screen for PD remotely, contributing to equity and access in neurological care."

We have also summarized the recent methodological progress in cancer biomarker discovery, such as high-throughput sequencing, liquid biopsy, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning and neural networks. Much attention has been given to the methodological details and comparison of the methodologies. Notably, these concepts and methodologies interact with each other and will likely lead to synergistic effects when carefully combined. Newer, more innovative concepts and methodologies are emerging as the current emerging ones became mainstream and widely applied to the field. Some future challenges are also discussed.

The potential of mpMRI coupled to artificial intelligence (AI) methods to detect and classify PCa before decision-making requires investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature for studies addressing the diagnostic performance of combined mpMRI and AI approaches to detect and classify PCa, and to provide selection criteria for relevant articles having clinical significance.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a nonsystematic search of the English language literature using the PubMed-MEDLINE database up to October 30, 2020. We included all original studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI and AI to detect and classify PCa with histopathological analysis as a reference standard.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies assessed AI and mpMRI approaches for PCa detection and classification based on a ground truth that referred to the entire prostate either with radical prostatectomy specimens (RPS) or relocalization of positive systematic and/or targeted biopsy. Seven studies retrospectively annotated cancerous lesions onto mpMRI identified in whole-mount sections from RPS, three studies used a backward projection of histological prostate biopsy information, and one study used a combined cohort of both approaches. All studies cross-validated their data sets; only four used a test set and one a multisite validation scheme. Performance metrics for lesion detection ranged from 87.9% to 92% at a threshold specificity of 50%. The lesion classification accuracy of the algorithms was comparable to that of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System.
CONCLUSIONS: For an algorithm to be implemented into radiological workflows and to be clinically applicable, it must be trained with a ground truth labeling that reflects histopathological information for the entire prostate and it must be externally validated. Lesion detection and classification performance metrics are promising but require prospective implementation and external validation for clinical significance.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed the literature for studies on prostate cancer detection and classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and artificial intelligence algorithms. The main application is in supporting radiologists in interpreting MRI scans and improving the diagnostic performance, so that fewer unnecessary biopsies are carried out."

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the performance of AI at detecting early Barrett's neoplasia.
METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials database from inception to the 28th Jan 2022 to identify studies on the detection of early Barrett's neoplasia using AI. Study quality was assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - 2 (QUADAS-2). A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostics odds ratio (DOR). Forest plots and a summary of the receiving operating characteristics (SROC) curves displayed the outcomes. Heterogeneity was determined by I 2, Tau2 statistics and p-value. The funnel plots and Deek's test were used to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: Twelve studies comprising of 1,361 patients (utilizing 532,328 images on which the various AI models were trained) were used. The SROC was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96). Pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio were 90.3% (95% CI: 87.1-92.7%), 84.4% (95% CI: 80.2-87.9%) and 48.1 (95% CI: 28.4-81.5), respectively. Subgroup analysis of AI models trained only on white light endoscopy was similar with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% (95% CI: 85.7-94.7%) and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.6%-88.1%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: AI is highly accurate at detecting early Barrett's neoplasia and validated for patients with at least high-grade dysplasia and above. Further well-designed prospective randomized controlled studies of all histopathological subtypes of early Barrett's neoplasia are needed to confirm these findings further."

These advances inevitably hold the promise to improve personal and population well-being and welfare substantially. It is paradoxical that while greater access to biotechnology on a population level has many advantages, it may also increase the likelihood and frequency of biodisasters due to accidental or malicious use. Similar to ""Disease X"" (describing unknown naturally emerging pathogenic diseases with a pandemic potential), we term this unknown risk from biotechnologies ""Biodisaster X."" To date, no studies have examined the potential role of information technologies in preventing and mitigating Biodisaster X.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore (1) what Biodisaster X might entail and (2) solutions that use artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging 6G technologies to help monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats.
METHODS: A review of the literature on applying AI and 6G technologies for monitoring and managing biodisasters was conducted on PubMed, using articles published from database inception through to November 16, 2020.
RESULTS: Our findings show that Biodisaster X has the potential to upend lives and livelihoods and destroy economies, essentially posing a looming risk for civilizations worldwide. To shed light on Biodisaster X threats, we detailed effective AI and 6G-enabled strategies, ranging from natural language processing to deep learning-based image analysis to address issues ranging from early Biodisaster X detection (eg, identification of suspicious behaviors), remote design and development of pharmaceuticals (eg, treatment development), and public health interventions (eg, reactive shelter-at-home mandate enforcement), as well as disaster recovery (eg, sentiment analysis of social media posts to shed light on the public's feelings and readiness for recovery building).
CONCLUSIONS: Biodisaster X is a looming but avoidable catastrophe. Considering the potential human and economic consequences Biodisaster X could cause, actions that can effectively monitor and manage Biodisaster X threats must be taken promptly and proactively. Rather than solely depending on overstretched professional attention of health experts and government officials, it is perhaps more cost-effective and practical to deploy technology-based solutions to prevent and control Biodisaster X threats. This study discusses what Biodisaster X could entail and emphasizes the importance of monitoring and managing Biodisaster X threats by AI techniques and 6G technologies. Future studies could explore how the convergence of AI and 6G systems may further advance the preparedness for high-impact, less likely events beyond Biodisaster X."

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems based on deep learning can achieve pathologist-level performance at Gleason grading. However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their expertise with feedback from an AI system could result in a synergy that outperforms both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around AI assistance, existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated the value of AI assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers graded 160 biopsies with and without AI assistance. Using AI, the agreement of the panel with an expert reference standard increased significantly (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.799 vs. 0.872; p = 0.019). On an external validation set of 87 cases, the panel showed a significant increase in agreement with a panel of international experts in prostate pathology (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.733 vs. 0.786; p = 0.003). In both experiments, on a group-level, AI-assisted pathologists outperformed the unassisted pathologists and the standalone AI system. Our results show the potential of AI systems for Gleason grading, but more importantly, show the benefits of pathologist-AI synergy."

Some cancer types, like pancreatic cancer, are challenging to diagnose or detect early, and the stages have a fast progression rate. This paper presents the state-of-the-art techniques used in cancer survival prediction, suggesting how these techniques can be implemented in predicting the overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (pdac) patients. Because of bewildering and high volumes of data, the recent studies highlight the importance of machine learning (ML) algorithms like support vector machines and convolutional neural networks. Studies predict pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (pdac) survival is within the limits of 41.7% at one year, 8.7% at three years, and 1.9% at five years. There is no significant correlation found between the disease stages and the overall survival rate. The implementation of ML algorithms can improve our understanding of cancer progression. ML methods need an appropriate level of validation to be considered in everyday clinical practice. The objective of these techniques is to perform classification, prediction, and estimation. Accurate predictions give pathologists information on the patient's state, surgical treatment to be done, optimal use of resources, individualized therapy, drugs to prescribe, and better patient management."

Recently, machine learning (ML) has shown to be able to predict cardiovascular/stroke risk in PD patients. The presence of COVID-19 causes the ML systems to become severely non-linear and poses challenges in cardiovascular/stroke risk stratification. Further, due to comorbidity, sample size constraints, and poor scientific and clinical validation techniques, there have been no well-explained ML paradigms. Deep neural networks are powerful learning machines that generalize non-linear conditions. This study presents a novel investigation of deep learning (DL) solutions for CVD/stroke risk prediction in PD patients affected by the COVID-19 framework. Method: The PRISMA search strategy was used for the selection of 292 studies closely associated with the effect of PD on CVD risk in the COVID-19 framework. We study the hypothesis that PD in the presence of COVID-19 can cause more harm to the heart and brain than in non-COVID-19 conditions. COVID-19 lung damage severity can be used as a covariate during DL training model designs. We, therefore, propose a DL model for the estimation of, (i) COVID-19 lesions in computed tomography (CT) scans and (ii) combining the covariates of PD, COVID-19 lesions, office and laboratory arterial atherosclerotic image-based biomarkers, and medicine usage for the PD patients for the design of DL point-based models for CVD/stroke risk stratification. Results: We validated the feasibility of CVD/stroke risk stratification in PD patients in the presence of a COVID-19 environment and this was also verified. DL architectures like long short-term memory (LSTM), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were studied for CVD/stroke risk stratification showing powerful designs. Lastly, we examined the artificial intelligence bias and provided recommendations for early detection of CVD/stroke in PD patients in the presence of COVID-19. Conclusion: The DL is a very powerful tool for predicting CVD/stroke risk in PD patients affected by COVID-19."

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP), can uncover hidden and nonlinear connections among syncope risk factors, disease features, and clinical outcomes. ML, DL, and NLP models can analyze vast amounts of data effectively and assist physicians to help distinguish true syncope from other types of transient loss of consciousness. Additionally, short-term adverse events and length of hospital stay can be predicted by these models. In syncope research, AI-based models shift the focus from causality to correlation analysis between entities. This prompts the search for patterns rather than defining a hypothesis to be tested a priori. Furthermore, education of students, doctors, and health care providers engaged in continuing medical education may benefit from clinical cases of syncope interacting with NLP-based virtual patient simulators. Education may be of benefit to patients. This article explores potential strengths, weaknesses, and proposed solutions associated with utilization of ML and DL in syncope diagnosis and management. Three main topics regarding syncope are addressed: 1) clinical decision-making; 2) clinical research; and 3) education.

METHODS: A non-systematic review was done. All articles published on Pub-Med, Medline, Google, and Google Scholar on AI or digital health regarding genomic sequencing, drug development, and vaccines of COVID-19 were scrutinized and summarized.
RESULTS: The sequence of SARS- CoV-2 was identified with the help of AI. It can help also in the prompt identification of variants of concern (VOC) as delta strains and Omicron. Furthermore, there are many drugs applied with the help of AI. These drugs included Atazanavir, Remdesivir, Efavirenz, Ritonavir, and Dolutegravir, PARP1 inhibitors (Olaparib and CVL218 which is Mefuparib hydrochloride), Abacavir, Roflumilast, Almitrine, and Mesylate. Many vaccines were developed utilizing the new technology of bioinformatics, databases, immune-informatics, machine learning, and reverse vaccinology to the whole SARS-CoV-2 proteomes or the structural proteins. Examples of these vaccines are the messenger RNA and viral vector vaccines. AI provides cost-saving and agility. However, the challenges of its usage are the difficulty of collecting data, the internal and external validation, ethical consideration, therapeutic effect, and the time needed for clinical trials after drug approval. Moreover, there is a common problem in the deep learning (DL) model which is the shortage of interpretability.
CONCLUSION: The growth of AI techniques in health care opened a broad gate for discovering the genomic sequences of the COVID-19 virus and the VOC. AI helps also in the development of vaccines and drugs (including drug repurposing) to obtain potential preventive and therapeutic agents for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic."

It uses optical sensors to acquire multiple 2D images from different angles which are reconstructed into a 3D digital model of the subject's surface. The technique proved to be especially useful in craniofacial applications, where it serves as a tool to overcome the limitations imposed by conventional imaging modalities and subjective evaluation methods. The capability to acquire high-dimensional data in a quick and safe manner and archive them for retrospective longitudinal analyses, provides the field with a methodology to increase the understanding of the morphological development of the cranium, its growth patterns and the effect of different treatments over time.This review describes the role of 3D stereophotogrammetry in the evaluation of craniosynostosis, including reliability studies, current and potential clinical use cases, and practical challenges. Finally, developments within the research field are analyzed by means of bibliometric networks, depicting prominent research topics, authors, and institutions, to stimulate new ideas and collaborations in the field of craniofacial 3D stereophotogrammetry.We anticipate that utilization of this modality's full potential requires a global effort in terms of collaborations, data sharing, standardization, and harmonization. Such developments can facilitate larger studies and novel deep learning methods that can aid in reaching an objective consensus regarding the most effective treatments for patients with craniosynostosis and other craniofacial anomalies, and to increase our understanding of these complex dysmorphologies and associated phenotypes."

Genomic alterations are highly diagnostic of tumor type, and tumor type classifiers trained on genomic features have been explored, but the most accurate methods are not clinically feasible, relying on features derived from whole genome sequencing (WGS), or predicting across limited cancer types. We use genomic features from a dataset of 39,787 solid tumors sequenced using a clinical targeted cancer gene panel to develop Genome-Derived-Diagnosis Ensemble (GDD-ENS): a hyperparameter ensemble for classifying tumor type using deep neural networks. GDD-ENS achieves 93% accuracy for high-confidence predictions across 38 cancer types, rivalling performance of WGS-based methods. GDD-ENS can also guide diagnoses on rare type and cancers of unknown primary, and incorporate patient-specific clinical information for improved predictions. Overall, integrating GDD-ENS into prospective clinical sequencing workflows has enabled clinically-relevant tumor type predictions to guide treatment decisions in real time."

However, the tumor segmentation in these studies depended on delineation or annotation of breast cancer by radiologist, which is often laborious, tedious, and vulnerable to inter- and intra-observer variability. Automatic segmentation is expected to overcome this difficulty. Herein, we aim to investigate the value of automatic segmentation-based multi-modal radiomics signature and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in predicting disease-free survival (DFS) of patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.
METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included a total of 643 female patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative ultrasound (US) and MRI for prognostic analysis. Data (n = 480) from center 1 were divided into training and internal testing sets, while data (n = 163) from centers 2 and 3 were analyzed as the external testing set. We developed automatic segmentation frameworks for tumor segmentation by deep learning. Then, Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression was used to select features to construct radiomics signature, and corresponding radiomics score (Rad-score) was calculated. Finally, six models for predicting DFS were constructed by using Cox regression and assessed in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: The multi-modal radiomics signature combining intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics signatures of US and MRI achieved a higher C-index in the internal (0.734) and external (0.708) testing sets than most other radiomics signatures in predicting DFS, and successfully stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups. The multi-modal clinical imaging model combining the multi-modal Rad-score and clinical traditional MRI model-score resulted in a higher C-index (0.795) than other models in the external testing set, and it had a better calibration and higher clinical benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the multi-modal radiomics signature derived from automatic segmentations of US and MRI is a promising risk stratification biomarker for breast cancer, and highlights that the appropriate combination of multi-modal radiomics signature, clinical characteristics, and MRI feature can improve performance of individualized DFS prediction, which might assist in guiding decision-making related to breast cancer."

METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective observational cohort study of 719 consecutive critically ill children with encephalopathy who underwent clinically-indicated continuous EEG monitoring (CEEG). We implemented and compared three state-of-the-art machine learning methods for ES prediction: (1) random forest; (2) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); and (3) Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT). We developed a ranking algorithm based on the relative importance of each variable derived from the machine learning methods.
RESULTS: Based on our ranking algorithm, the top five variables for ES prediction were: (1) epileptiform discharges in the initial 30 minutes, (2) clinical seizures prior to CEEG initiation, (3) sex, (4) age dichotomized at 1 year, and (5) epileptic encephalopathy. Compared to the stepwise selection-based approach in logistic regression, the top variables selected by our ranking algorithm were more informative as models utilizing the top variables achieved better prediction performance evaluated by prediction accuracy, AUROC and F1 score. Adding additional variables did not improve and sometimes worsened model performance.
CONCLUSION: The ranking algorithm was helpful in deriving a parsimonious model for ES prediction with optimal performance. However, application of state-of-the-art machine learning models did not substantially improve model performance compared to prior logistic regression models. Thus, to further improve the ES prediction, we may need to collect more samples and variables that provide additional information."

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can detect MSI/dMMR directly in routine pathology slides, but the test performance has not been systematically investigated with predefined test thresholds.
METHOD: We trained and validated AI-based MSI/dMMR detectors and evaluated predefined performance metrics using nine patient cohorts of 8343 patients across different countries and ethnicities.
RESULTS: Classifiers achieved clinical-grade performance, yielding an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of up to 0.96 without using any manual annotations. Subsequently, we show that the AI system can be applied as a rule-out test: by using cohort-specific thresholds, on average 52.73% of tumors in each surgical cohort [total number of MSI/dMMR = 1020, microsatellite stable (MSS)/ proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) = 7323 patients] could be identified as MSS/pMMR with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. In an additional cohort of N = 1530 (MSI/dMMR = 211, MSS/pMMR = 1319) endoscopy biopsy samples, the system achieved an AUROC of 0.89, and the cohort-specific threshold ruled out 44.12% of tumors with a fixed sensitivity at 95%. As a more robust alternative to cohort-specific thresholds, we showed that with a fixed threshold of 0.25 for all the cohorts, we can rule-out 25.51% in surgical specimens and 6.10% in biopsies.
INTERPRETATION: When applied in a clinical setting, this means that the AI system can rule out MSI/dMMR in a quarter (with global thresholds) or half of all CRC patients (with local fine-tuning), thereby reducing cost and turnaround time for molecular profiling."

GCTs show differences in global and promoter methylation patterns by histologic subtype. We conducted an epigenome-wide study to identify methylation differences by GCT histology.
METHODS: Using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array we measured methylation in 154 paediatric GCTs (21 germinomas/seminomas/dysgerminoma, 70 yolk sac tumours [YST], 9 teratomas, and 54 mixed histology tumours). We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between GCT histologies by comparing methylation beta values.
RESULTS: We identified 8,481 DMRs (FWER < 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of individual probes within DMRs resulted in four high level clusters closely corresponding to tumour histology. Clusters corresponding to age, location, sex and FFPE status were not observed within these DMRs. Germinomas displayed lower levels of methylation across the DMRs relative to the other histologic subtypes. Pathway analysis on the top 10% of genes with differential methylation in germinomas/seminomas/dysgerminoma compared to YST suggested angiogenesis and immune cell-related pathways displayed decreased methylation in germinomas/seminomas/dysgerminoma relative to YST.
CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric GCT histologies have differential methylation patterns. The genes that are differentially methylated may provide insights into GCT aetiology including the timing of GCT initiation."

This is particularly true for neurological diseases where development of reliable biomarkers is often limited by difficulty visualising and sampling relevant cell and molecular pathobiology. To date, much work has relied on Cox regression because of ease-of-use, despite evidence that this model includes incorrect assumptions. We have implemented a set of deep learning and spline models for time-to-event modelling within a fully customizable 'app' and accompanying online portal, both of which can be used for any time-to-event analysis in any disease by a non-expert user. Our online portal includes capacity for end-users including patients, Neurology clinicians, and researchers, to access and perform predictions using a trained model, and to contribute new data for model improvement, all within a data-secure environment. We demonstrate a pipeline for use of our app with three use-cases including imputation of missing data, hyperparameter tuning, model training and independent validation. We show that predictions are optimal for use in downstream applications such as genetic discovery, biomarker interpretation, and personalised choice of medication. We demonstrate the efficiency of an ensemble configuration, including focused training of a deep learning model. We have optimised a pipeline for imputation of missing data in combination with time-to-event prediction models.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in two institutions, a secondary care hospital and tertiary referral oncology centre. Commercially available AI software performed a comparative analysis of chest radiographs and radiologists' authorised reports using a deep learning and natural language processing algorithm, respectively. The AI-detected discrepant findings between images and reports were assessed for clinical relevance by an external radiologist, as part of the commercial service provided by the AI vendor. The selected missed findings were subsequently returned to the institution's radiologist for final review.
RESULTS: In total, 25,104 chest radiographs of 21,039 patients (mean age 61.1 years ± 16.2 [SD]; 10,436 men) were included. The AI software detected discrepancies between imaging and reports in 21.1% (5289 of 25,104). After review by the external radiologist, 0.9% (47 of 5289) of cases were deemed to contain clinically relevant missed findings. The institution's radiologists confirmed 35 of 47 missed findings (74.5%) as clinically relevant (0.1% of all cases). Missed findings consisted of lung nodules (71.4%, 25 of 35), pneumothoraces (17.1%, 6 of 35) and consolidations (11.4%, 4 of 35).
CONCLUSION: The AI-assisted double reading system was able to identify missed findings on chest radiographs after report authorisation. The approach required an external radiologist to review the AI-detected discrepancies. The number of clinically relevant missed findings by radiologists was very low.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The AI-assisted double reader workflow was shown to detect diagnostic errors and could be applied as a quality assurance tool. Although clinically relevant missed findings were rare, there is potential impact given the common use of chest radiography.
KEY POINTS: • A commercially available double reading system supported by artificial intelligence was evaluated to detect reporting errors in chest radiographs (n=25,104) from two institutions. • Clinically relevant missed findings were found in 0.1% of chest radiographs and consisted of unreported lung nodules, pneumothoraces and consolidations. • Applying AI software as a secondary reader after report authorisation can assist in reducing diagnostic errors without interrupting the radiologist's reading workflow. However, the number of AI-detected discrepancies was considerable and required review by a radiologist to assess their relevance."

Carotid plaques, detectable via ultrasound, are a well-established marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. In this study, we trained a deep learning model to detect plaques in 177,757 carotid ultrasound images from 19,499 UK Biobank (UKB) participants (aged 47-83 years) to assess the prevalence, risk factors, prognostic significance, and genetic architecture of carotid atherosclerosis in a large population-based cohort. The model demonstrated high performance metrics with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 89.3%, 89.5%, 89.2%, and 82.9%, respectively, identifying carotid plaques in 45% of the population. Plaque presence and count were significantly associated with future cardiovascular events over a median follow-up period of up to 7 years, leading to improved risk reclassification beyond established clinical prediction models. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of carotid plaques (29,790 cases, 36,847 controls) uncovered two novel genomic loci (p &lt; 5×10-8) with downstream analyses implicating lipoprotein(a) and interleukin-6 signaling, both targets of investigational drugs in advanced clinical development. Observational and Mendelian randomization analyses showed associations between smoking, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high blood pressure and the odds of carotid plaque presence. Our study underscores the potential of carotid plaque assessment for improving cardiovascular risk prediction, provides novel insights into the genetic basis of subclinical atherosclerosis, and offers a valuable resource for advancing atherosclerosis research at the population scale."

Because AVS availability is limited, efforts have been made to develop strategies to bypass it. However, it has so far proven unsuccessful in applying clinical practice, partly due to heterogeneity and missing values of the cohorts. For this purpose, we retrospectively assessed 210 PA cases from three institutions where segment-selective AVS, which is more accurate and sensitive for detecting PA cases with surgical indications, was available. A machine learning-based classification model featuring a new cross-center domain adaptation capability was developed. The model identified 102 patients with PA who benefited from surgery in the present cohort. A new data imputation technique was used to address cross-center heterogeneity, making a common prediction model applicable across multiple cohorts. Logistic regression demonstrated higher accuracy than Random Forest and Deep Learning [(0.89, 0.86) vs. (0.84, 0.84), (0.82, 0.84) for surgical or medical indications in terms of f-score]. A derived integrated flowchart revealed that 35.2% of PA cases required AVS with 94.1% accuracy. The present model enabled us to reduce the burden of AVS on patients who would benefit the most."

We review epidemiological and pathological data on LC and CRC, and the features of screening chest low-dose CT and CT colonography comprising execution, reading, radiation exposure and harm, and the cost effectiveness of the two CT screening interventions. The possibility of combining chest low-dose CT and CT colonography examinations for double LC and CRC screening in a single CT appointment is then addressed. We demonstrate how this approach appears feasible and is already reasonable as an opportunistic screening intervention in 50-75-year-old subjects with smoking history and average CRC risk. In addition to the crucial role Computer Assisted Diagnosis systems play in decreasing the test reading times and the need to educate radiologists in screening chest LDCT and CT colonography, in view of a single CT appointment for double screening, the following uncertainties need to be solved: (1) the schedule of the screening CT; (2) the effectiveness of iterative reconstruction and deep learning algorithms affording an ultra-low-dose CT acquisition technique and (3) management of incidental findings. Resolving these issues will imply new cost-effectiveness analyses for LC screening with chest low dose CT and for CRC screening with CT colonography and, especially, for the double LC and CRC screening with a single-appointment CT."

However, effectively utilizing high-dimensional clinical data for genetic discovery remains challenging. Here we introduce a general deep learning-based framework, REpresentation learning for Genetic discovery on Low-dimensional Embeddings (REGLE), for discovering associations between genetic variants and high-dimensional clinical data. REGLE uses convolutional variational autoencoders to compute a non-linear, low-dimensional, disentangled embedding of the data with highly heritable individual components. REGLE can incorporate expert-defined or clinical features and provides a framework to create accurate disease-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS) in datasets which have minimal expert phenotyping. We apply REGLE to both respiratory and circulatory systems: spirograms which measure lung function and photoplethysmograms (PPG) which measure blood volume changes. Genome-wide association studies on REGLE embeddings identify more genome-wide significant loci than existing methods and replicate known loci for both spirograms and PPG, demonstrating the generality of the framework. Furthermore, these embeddings are associated with overall survival. Finally, we construct a set of PRSs that improve predictive performance of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and systolic blood pressure in multiple biobanks. Thus, REGLE embeddings can quantify clinically relevant features that are not currently captured in a standardized or automated way."

We searched four databases for articles published between January 2005-February 2019. We summarized data on CAD type, study design, and diagnostic accuracy. We assessed risk of bias with QUADAS-2. We included 53 of the 4712 articles reviewed: 40 focused on CAD design methods (""Development"" studies) and 13 focused on evaluation of CAD (""Clinical"" studies). Meta-analyses were not performed due to methodological differences. Development studies were more likely to use CXR databases with greater potential for bias as compared to Clinical studies. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (median AUC [IQR]) were significantly higher: in Development studies AUC: 0.88 [0.82-0.90]) versus Clinical studies (0.75 [0.66-0.87]; p-value 0.004); and with deep-learning (0.91 [0.88-0.99]) versus machine-learning (0.82 [0.75-0.89]; p = 0.001).

Understanding the association between CNVs and disease susceptibility is of significant importance in disease genetics research and often requires analysis of large sample sizes. One of the most cost-effective and scalable methods for detecting CNVs is based on normalized signal intensity values, such as Log R Ratio (LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF), from Illumina genotyping arrays. In this study, we present CNV-Finder, a novel pipeline integrating deep learning techniques on array data, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to expedite the large-scale identification of CNVs within predefined genomic regions. This facilitates the efficient prioritization of samples for subsequent, costly analyses such as short-read and long-read whole genome sequencing. We focus on five genes-Parkin (PRKN), Leucine Rich Repeat And Ig Domain Containing 2 (LINGO2), Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT), alpha-Synuclein (SNCA), and Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein (APP)-which may be relevant to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or related disorders such as essential tremor (ET). By training our models on expert-annotated samples and validating them across diverse cohorts, including those from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) and additional dementia-specific databases, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNV-Finder in accurately detecting deletions and duplications. Our pipeline outputs app-compatible files for visualization within CNV-Finder's interactive web application. This interface enables researchers to review predictions and filter displayed samples by model prediction values, LRR range, and variant count in order to explore or confirm results. Our pipeline integrates this human feedback to enhance model performance and reduce false positive rates. Through a series of comprehensive analyses and validations using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, we demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of CNV-Finder in identifying CNVs with regions of varied sparsity, noise, and size. Our findings highlight the significance of contextual understanding and human expertise in enhancing the precision of CNV identification, particularly in complex genomic regions like 17q21.31. The CNV-Finder pipeline is a scalable, publicly available resource for the scientific community, available on GitHub (https://github.com/GP2code/CNV-Finder; DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14182563). CNV-Finder not only expedites accurate candidate identification but also significantly reduces the manual workload for researchers, enabling future targeted validation and downstream analyses in regions or phenotypes of interest."

Currently, preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is the gold standard for detecting ploidy abnormalities. However, PGT-A has several inherent limitations, including invasive biopsy, high economic burden, and ethical constraints. This paper provides the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms using embryonic images for non-invasive prediction of embryonic ploidy.
METHODS: Comprehensive searches of studies that developed or utilized AI algorithms to predict embryonic ploidy from embryonic imaging, published up until August 10, 2024, across PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were performed. Studies with prospective or retrospective designs were included without language restrictions. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve, along with pooled sensitivity and specificity, was estimated using a bivariate random-effects model. The risk of bias and study quality were evaluated using the QUADAS-AI tool. Heterogeneity was quantified using the inconsistency index (I 2 ), derived from Cochran's Q test. Predefined subgroup analyses and bivariate meta-regression were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024500409).
FINDINGS: Twenty eligible studies were identified, with twelve studies included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of AI for predicting embryonic euploidy were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.59-0.81), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.69-0.80), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76-0.83), respectively, based on a total of 6879 embryos (3110 euploid and 3769 aneuploid). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses identified the type of AI-driven decision support system, external validation, risk of bias, and year of publication as the primary contributors to the observed heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that AI algorithms exhibit promising performance in predicting embryonic euploidy based on embryonic imaging. Although the current AI models developed cannot entirely replace invasive methods for determining embryo ploidy, AI demonstrates promise as an auxiliary decision-making tool for embryo selection, particularly for individuals who are unable to undergo PGT-A. To enhance the quality of future research, it is essential to overcome the specific challenges and limitations associated with AI studies in reproductive medicine.

Existing clinical risk scores are inadequate in predicting cardiac events, and conventional risk factors alone do not accurately classify many individuals at risk. Several CVD biomarkers consider the multiple pathways involved in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the primary cause of CVD/Stroke in RA. To enhance the accuracy of CVD/Stroke risk assessment in the RA framework, a proposed approach involves combining genomic-based biomarkers (GBBM) derived from plasma and/or serum samples with innovative non-invasive radiomic-based biomarkers (RBBM), such as measurements of synovial fluid, plaque area, and plaque burden. This review presents two hypotheses: (i) RBBM and GBBM biomarkers exhibit a significant correlation and can precisely detect the severity of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based preventive, precision, and personalized (aiP3) CVD/Stroke risk AtheroEdge™ model (AtheroPoint™, CA, USA) that utilizes deep learning (DL) to accurately classify the risk of CVD/stroke in RA framework. The authors conducted a comprehensive search using the PRISMA technique, identifying 153 studies that assessed the features/biomarkers of RBBM and GBBM for CVD/Stroke. The study demonstrates how DL models can be integrated into the AtheroEdge™-aiP3 framework to determine the risk of CVD/Stroke in RA patients. The findings of this review suggest that the combination of RBBM with GBBM introduces a new dimension to the assessment of CVD/Stroke risk in the RA framework. Synovial fluid levels that are higher than normal lead to an increase in the plaque burden. Additionally, the review provides recommendations for novel, unbiased, and pruned DL algorithms that can predict CVD/Stroke risk within a RA framework that is preventive, precise, and personalized."

Kidney histology helps diagnose DN and predict its outcomes, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach will maximize clinical utility of histopathological evaluation. Herein, we addressed whether AI-based integration of urine proteomics and image features improves DN classification and its outcome prediction, altogether augmenting and advancing pathology practice.
METHODS: We studied whole slide images (WSIs) of periodic acid-Schiff-stained kidney biopsies from 56 DN patients with associated urinary proteomics data. We identified urinary proteins differentially expressed in patients who developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within two years of biopsy. Extending our previously published human-AI-loop pipeline, six renal sub-compartments were computationally segmented from each WSI. Hand-engineered image features for glomeruli and tubules, and urinary protein measurements, were used as inputs to deep-learning frameworks to predict ESKD outcome. Differential expression was correlated with digital image features using the Spearman rank sum coefficient.
RESULTS: A total of 45 urinary proteins were differentially detected in progressors, which was most predictive of ESKD (AUC=0.95), while tubular and glomerular features were less predictive (AUC=0.71 and AUC=0.63, respectively). Accordingly, a correlation map between canonical cell-type proteins, such as epidermal growth factor and secreted phosphoprotein 1, and AI-based image features was obtained, which supports previous pathobiological results.
CONCLUSIONS: Computational method-based integration of urinary and image biomarkers may improve the pathophysiological understanding of DN progression as well as carry clinical implications in histopathological evaluation."

In IBS, diagnosis and treatment options are limited, but evidence for involvement of the gut microbiome in disease pathophysiology is emerging. Here we analyzed the prevalence of endoscopically visible mucosal biofilms in gastrointestinal disease and associated changes in microbiome composition and metabolism.
METHODS: The presence of mucosal biofilms was assessed in 1426 patients at 2 European university-based endoscopy centers. One-hundred and seventeen patients were selected for in-depth molecular and microscopic analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon-sequencing of colonic biopsies and fecal samples, confocal microscopy with deep learning-based image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, metabolomics, and in vitro biofilm formation assays.
RESULTS: Biofilms were present in 57% of patients with IBS and 34% of patients with ulcerative colitis compared with 6% of controls (P < .001). These yellow-green adherent layers of the ileum and right-sided colon were microscopically confirmed to be dense bacterial biofilms. 16S-sequencing links the presence of biofilms to a dysbiotic gut microbiome, including overgrowth of Escherichia coli and Ruminococcus gnavus. R. gnavus isolates cultivated from patient biofilms also formed biofilms in vitro. Metabolomic analysis found an accumulation of bile acids within biofilms that correlated with fecal bile acid excretion, linking this phenotype with a mechanism of diarrhea.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mucosal biofilms is an endoscopic feature in a subgroup of IBS and ulcerative colitis with disrupted bile acid metabolism and bacterial dysbiosis. They provide novel insight into the pathophysiology of IBS and ulcerative colitis, illustrating that biofilm can be seen as a tipping point in the development of dysbiosis and disease."

This model accurately recapitulated manual refinement labels for three independent testing sets (13,579 variants) and accurately predicted somatic variants confirmed by orthogonal validation sequencing data (212,158 variants). The model improves on manual somatic refinement by reducing bias on calls otherwise subject to high inter-reviewer variability."

Adverse outcome prediction might help with the management of patients with BD.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the performance of machine learning (ML) studies in predicting adverse outcomes (relapse or recurrence, hospital admission, and suicide-related events) in patients with BD. Demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging-related poor outcome predictors were also reviewed. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were explored from inception to July 2023.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies, accounting for >30,000 patients, were included. Support vector machine, decision trees, random forest, and logistic regression were the most frequently used ML algorithms. ML models' area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity ranged from 0.71 to 0.98, 72.7-92.8 %, and 59.0-95.2 % for relapse/recurrence prediction (4 studies (3 on relapses and 1 on recurrences). The corresponding values were 0.78-0.88, 21.4-100 %, and 77.0-99.7 % for hospital admissions (3 studies, 21,266 patients), and 0.71-0.99, 44.4-97.9 %, and 38.9-95.0 % for suicide-related events (10 studies, 5558 patients). Also, one study addressed a combination of the interest outcomes. Adverse outcome predictors included early onset BD, BD type I, comorbid psychiatric or substance use disorder, circadian rhythm disruption, hospitalization characteristics, and neuroimaging parameters, including increased dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, decreased frontolimbic functional connectivity and aberrant dynamic functional connectivity in corticostriatal circuitry.
CONCLUSIONS: ML models can predict adverse outcomes of BD with relatively acceptable performance measures. Future studies with larger samples and nested cross-validation validation should be conducted to reach more reliable results."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 2 major COVID-19 literature databases, the National Institutes of Health's LitCovid and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 database on March 9, 2021. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, 2 reviewers independently reviewed all the articles in 2 rounds of screening.
RESULTS: In the 794 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, we identified 7 key COVID-19 research areas in which AI was applied, including disease forecasting, medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and prognosis (non-imaging), drug repurposing and early drug discovery, social media data analysis, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis, and other COVID-19 research topics. We also found that there was a lack of heterogenous data integration in these AI applications.
DISCUSSION: Risk factors relevant to COVID-19 outcomes exist in heterogeneous data sources, including electronic health records, surveillance systems, sociodemographic datasets, and many more. However, most AI applications in COVID-19 research adopted a single-sourced approach that could omit important risk factors and thus lead to biased algorithms. Integrating heterogeneous data for modeling will help realize the full potential of AI algorithms, improve precision, and reduce bias.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data integration in the AI applications in COVID-19 research and a need for a multilevel AI framework that supports the analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources."

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to make a significant, positive impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with AMD; however, the development of effective AI devices for clinical care faces numerous considerations and challenges, a fact evidenced by a current absence of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AI devices for AMD.
PURPOSE: To delineate the state of AI for AMD, including current data, standards, achievements, and challenges.
METHODS: Members of the Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging Working Group for AI in AMD attended an inaugural meeting on September 7, 2020, to discuss the topic. Subsequently, they undertook a comprehensive review of the medical literature relevant to the topic. Members engaged in meetings and discussion through December 2021 to synthesize the information and arrive at a consensus.
RESULTS: Existing infrastructure for robust AI development for AMD includes several large, labeled data sets of color fundus photography and OCT images; however, image data often do not contain the metadata necessary for the development of reliable, valid, and generalizable models. Data sharing for AMD model development is made difficult by restrictions on data privacy and security, although potential solutions are under investigation. Computing resources may be adequate for current applications, but knowledge of machine learning development may be scarce in many clinical ophthalmology settings. Despite these challenges, researchers have produced promising AI models for AMD for screening, diagnosis, prediction, and monitoring. Future goals include defining benchmarks to facilitate regulatory authorization and subsequent clinical setting generalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Delivering an FDA-authorized, AI-based device for clinical care in AMD involves numerous considerations, including the identification of an appropriate clinical application; acquisition and development of a large, high-quality data set; development of the AI architecture; training and validation of the model; and functional interactions between the model output and clinical end user.

To assess the potential to further improve performance of HRME image analysis, we also conducted a retrospective analysis assessing performance of a multi-task convolutional neural network to segment and classify HRME images. One thousand four hundred eighty-six subjects completed the study; 435 (29%) subjects had CIN Grade 2 or more severe (CIN2+) diagnosis. HRME with morphologic image analysis for detection of CIN Grade 3 or more severe diagnoses (CIN3+) was similarly sensitive (95.6% vs 96.2%, P = .81) and specific (56.6% vs 58.7%, P = .18) as colposcopy. HRME with morphologic image analysis for detection of CIN2+ was slightly less sensitive (91.7% vs 95.6%, P < .01) and specific (59.7% vs 63.4%, P = .02) than colposcopy. Images from 870 subjects were used to train a multi-task convolutional neural network-based algorithm and images from the remaining 616 were used to validate its performance. There were no significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity of HRME with neural network analysis vs colposcopy for detection of CIN2+ or CIN3+. Using a neural network-based algorithm, HRME has comparable sensitivity and specificity to colposcopy for detection of CIN2+. HRME could provide a low-cost, point-of-care alternative to colposcopy and biopsy in the prevention of cervical cancer."

RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in this systematic review, with sample sizes ranging between 53 and 351. 1,362 MS patients and 1,118 NMOSD patients were included in our systematic review. AQP4-Ab was positive in 94.9% of NMOSD patients in 9 studies. Eight studies used machine learning [ML] as a classifier, while 7 used deep learning [DL]. AI models based on only MRI or MRI and clinical features yielded a pooled accuracy of 82% (95% CI: 78-86%), sensitivity of 83% (95% CI: 79-88%), and specificity of 80% (95% CI: 75-86%). In subgroup analysis, using only MRI features yielded an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83% (95% CI: 78-88%), 81% (95% CI: 76-87%), and 84% (95% CI: 79-89%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: AI models based on MRI features showed a high potential to discriminate between NMOSD and MS. However, heterogeneity in MR imaging, model evaluation, and reporting performance metrics, among other confounders, affected the reliability of our results. Well-designed studies on multicentric datasets, standardized imaging and evaluation protocols, and detailed transparent reporting of results are needed to reach optimal performance."

Though widely used and information-rich, it cannot directly inform about specific molecular markers, which require additional experiments to assess. To address this gap, we present ROSIE, a deep-learning framework that computationally imputes the expression and localization of dozens of proteins from H&amp;E images. Our model is trained on a dataset of over 1000 paired and aligned H&amp;E and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) samples from 20 tissues and disease conditions, spanning over 16 million cells. Validation of our in silico mIF staining method on held-out H&amp;E samples demonstrates that the predicted biomarkers are effective in identifying cell phenotypes, particularly distinguishing lymphocytes such as B cells and T cells, which are not readily discernible with H&amp;E staining alone. Additionally, ROSIE facilitates the robust identification of stromal and epithelial microenvironments and immune cell subtypes like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are important for understanding tumor-immune interactions and can help inform treatment strategies in cancer research."

Access to multimodal HDCD provides a unique opportunity for genetic studies of complex traits because different modalities relevant to a single physiological system (e.g., circulatory system) encode complementary and overlapping information. We propose a novel multimodal deep learning method, M-REGLE, for discovering genetic associations from a joint representation of multiple complementary HDCD modalities. We showcase the effectiveness of this model by applying it to several cardiovascular modalities. M-REGLE jointly learns a lower representation (i.e., latent factors) of multimodal HDCD using a convolutional variational autoencoder, performs genome wide association studies (GWAS) on each latent factor, then combines the results to study the genetics of the underlying system. To validate the advantages of M-REGLE and multimodal learning, we apply it to common cardiovascular modalities (PPG and ECG), and compare its results to unimodal learning methods in which representations are learned from each data modality separately, but the downstream genetic analyses are performed on the combined unimodal representations. M-REGLE identifies 19.3% more loci on the 12-lead ECG dataset, 13.0% more loci on the ECG lead I + PPG dataset, and its genetic risk score significantly outperforms the unimodal risk score at predicting cardiac phenotypes, such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), in multiple biobanks."

Epub 2021 Sep 8.,Smolyansky ED,Epilepsy Behav,2021,2021/09/10,,,10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108273,"PURPOSE: There remain major challenges for the clinician in managing patients with epilepsy effectively. Choosing anti-seizure medications (ASMs) is subject to trial and error. About one-third of patients have drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Surgery may be considered for selected patients, but time from diagnosis to surgery averages 20 years. We reviewed the potential use of machine learning (ML) predictive models as clinical decision support tools to help address some of these issues.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline and Embase of studies that investigated the application of ML in epilepsy management in terms of predicting ASM responsiveness, predicting DRE, identifying surgical candidates, and predicting epilepsy surgery outcomes. Original articles addressing these 4 areas published in English between 2000 and 2020 were included.
RESULTS: We identified 24 relevant articles: 6 on ASM responsiveness, 3 on DRE prediction, 2 on identifying surgical candidates, and 13 on predicting surgical outcomes. A variety of potential predictors were used including clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, electroencephalography, and health system claims data. A number of different ML algorithms and approaches were used for prediction, but only one study utilized deep learning methods. Some models show promising performance with areas under the curve above 0.9. However, most were single setting studies (18 of 24) with small sample sizes (median number of patients 55), with the exception of 3 studies that utilized large databases and 3 studies that performed external validation. There was a lack of standardization in reporting model performance. None of the models reviewed have been prospectively evaluated for their clinical benefits.
CONCLUSION: The utility of ML models for clinical decision support in epilepsy management remains to be determined. Future research should be directed toward conducting larger studies with external validation, standardization of reporting, and prospective evaluation of the ML model on patient outcomes."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a machine-learning model based on clinical features for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.
METHOD: 725 patients were used to train and validate the model. This included a retrospective cohort from Wuhan, China of 299 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 23 December 2019 to 13 February 2020, and five cohorts with 426 patients from eight centres in China, Italy and Belgium from 20 February 2020 to 21 March 2020. The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalisation. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and metrics derived from the confusion matrix.
RESULTS: In the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years and 137 (45.8%) were male. In the five test cohorts, the median age was 62 years and 236 (55.4%) were male. The model was prospectively validated on five cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.93, with accuracies ranging from 74.4% to 87.5%, sensitivities ranging from 75.0% to 96.9%, and specificities ranging from 55.0% to 88.0%, most of which performed better than the pneumonia severity index. The cut-off values of the low-, medium- and high-risk probabilities were 0.21 and 0.80. The online calculators can be found at www.covid19risk.ai.

Accurate prediction of peritoneal recurrence and disease-free survival (DFS) is crucial to identify patients who might benefit from intensive treatment. We aimed to develop a predictive model for peritoneal recurrence and prognosis in AOC.
METHODS: In this retrospective multi-institution study of 515 patients, an end-to-end multi-task convolutional neural network (MCNN) comprising a segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) and a classification CNN was developed and tested using preoperative CT images, and MCNN-score was generated to indicate the peritoneal recurrence and DFS status in patients with AOC. We evaluated the accuracy of the model for automatic segmentation and predict prognosis.
RESULTS: The MCNN achieved promising segmentation performances with a mean Dice coefficient of 84.3% (range: 78.8%-87.0%). The MCNN was able to predict peritoneal recurrence in the training (AUC 0.87; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), internal test (0.88; 0.85-0.92), and external test set (0.82; 0.78-0.86). Similarly, MCNN demonstrated consistently high accuracy in predicting recurrence, with an AUC of 0.85; 95% CI 0.82-0.88, 0.83; 95% CI 0.80-0.86, and 0.85; 95% CI 0.83-0.88. For patients with a high MCNN-score of recurrence, it was associated with poorer DFS with P < 0.0001 and hazard ratios of 0.1964 (95% CI: 0.1439-0.2680), 0.3249 (95% CI: 0.1896-0.5565), and 0.3458 (95% CI: 0.2582-0.4632).

Here, we applied image-based screening of a genome-wide CRISPR library to systematically identify host cell regulators of Ebola virus infection in 39,085,093 million single cells. Measuring viral RNA and protein levels together with their localization in cells identified over 998 related host factors and provided detailed information about the role of each gene across the virus replication cycle. We trained a deep learning model on single-cell images to associate each host factor with predicted replication steps, and confirmed the predicted relationship for select host factors. Among the findings, we showed that the mitochondrial complex III subunit UQCRB is a post-entry regulator of Ebola virus RNA replication, and demonstrated that UQCRB inhibition with a small molecule reduced overall Ebola virus infection with an IC50 of 5 μM. Using a random forest model, we also identified perturbations that reduced infection by disrupting the equilibrium between viral RNA and protein. One such protein, STRAP, is a spliceosome-associated factor that was found to be closely associated with VP35, a viral protein required for RNA processing. Loss of STRAP expression resulted in a reduction in full-length viral genome production and subsequent production of non-infectious virus particles. Overall, the data produced in this genome-wide high-content single-cell screen and secondary screens in additional cell lines and related filoviruses (MARV and SUDV) revealed new insights about the role of host factors in virus replication and potential new targets for therapeutic intervention."

Herein, we leverage a state-of-the art deep representation learning method, Surreal-GAN, and present both methodological advances and extensive experimental results that allow us to elucidate the heterogeneity of brain aging in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals from 11 studies. Five dominant patterns of neurodegeneration were identified and quantified for each individual by their respective (herein referred to as) R-indices. Significant associations between R-indices and distinct biomedical, lifestyle, and genetic factors provide insights into the etiology of observed variances. Furthermore, baseline R-indices showed predictive value for disease progression and mortality. These five R-indices contribute to MRI-based precision diagnostics, prognostication, and may inform stratification into clinical trials."

Yet, their implication for disease pathogenesis remains largely limited. Here, we introduce scPRS, a geometric deep learning model that constructs single-cell-resolved PRS leveraging reference single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling data to enhance biological discovery as well as disease prediction. Real-world applications across multiple complex diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), showcase the superior prediction power of scPRS compared to traditional PRS methods. Importantly, scPRS not only predicts disease risk but also uncovers disease-relevant cells, such as hormone-high alpha and beta cells for T2D, cardiomyocytes and pericytes for HCM, and astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells for AD. Facilitated by a layered multi-omic analysis, scPRS further identifies cell-type-specific genetic underpinnings, linking disease-associated genetic variants to gene regulation within corresponding cell types. We substantiate the disease relevance of scPRS-prioritized HCM genes and demonstrate that the suppression of these genes in HCM cardiomyocytes is rescued by Mavacamten treatment. Additionally, we establish a novel microglia-specific regulatory relationship between the AD risk variant rs7922621 and its target genes ANXA11 and TSPAN14. We further illustrate the detrimental effects of suppressing these two genes on microglia phagocytosis.

Most fields of medicine follow that popular trend and, notably, radiation oncology is one of those that are at the forefront, with already a long tradition in using digital images and fully computerized workflows. ML models are driven by data, and in contrast with many statistical or physical models, they can be very large and complex, with countless generic parameters. This inevitably raises two questions, namely, the tight dependence between the models and the datasets that feed them, and the interpretability of the models, which scales with its complexity. Any problems in the data used to train the model will be later reflected in their performance. This, together with the low interpretability of ML models, makes their implementation into the clinical workflow particularly difficult. Building tools for risk assessment and quality assurance of ML models must involve then two main points: interpretability and data-model dependency. After a joint introduction of both radiation oncology and ML, this paper reviews the main risks and current solutions when applying the latter to workflows in the former. Risks associated with data and models, as well as their interaction, are detailed. Next, the core concepts of interpretability, explainability, and data-model dependency are formally defined and illustrated with examples. Afterwards, a broad discussion goes through key applications of ML in workflows of radiation oncology as well as vendors' perspectives for the clinical implementation of ML."

To address this, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have been developed to automate text processing. In the biomedical field, various toolkits for text processing exist, which have greatly improved the efficiency of handling unstructured text. However, these existing toolkits tend to emphasize different perspectives, and none of them offer generation capabilities, leaving a significant gap in the current offerings.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development and preliminary evaluation of Ascle. Ascle is tailored for biomedical researchers and clinical staff with an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution that requires minimal programming expertise. For the first time, Ascle provides 4 advanced and challenging generative functions: question-answering, text summarization, text simplification, and machine translation. In addition, Ascle integrates 12 essential NLP functions, along with query and search capabilities for clinical databases.
METHODS: We fine-tuned 32 domain-specific language models and evaluated them thoroughly on 27 established benchmarks. In addition, for the question-answering task, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for large language models that incorporated a medical knowledge graph with ranking techniques to enhance the reliability of generated answers. Additionally, we conducted a physician validation to assess the quality of generated content beyond automated metrics.
RESULTS: The fine-tuned models and RAG framework consistently enhanced text generation tasks. For example, the fine-tuned models improved the machine translation task by 20.27 in terms of BLEU score. In the question-answering task, the RAG framework raised the ROUGE-L score by 18% over the vanilla models. Physician validation of generated answers showed high scores for readability (4.95/5) and relevancy (4.43/5), with a lower score for accuracy (3.90/5) and completeness (3.31/5).
CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces the development and evaluation of Ascle, a user-friendly NLP toolkit designed for medical text generation. All code is publicly available through the Ascle GitHub repository. All fine-tuned language models can be accessed through Hugging Face."

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of 2 clinical trial cohorts: AREDS and AREDS2.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants with no late AMD in either eye at baseline in AREDS (n = 2719) and AREDS2 (n = 1472).
METHODS: Five-year rates of progression to late AMD were calculated according to levels 0 to 4 on the simplified severity scale after 2 updates: (1) noncentral geographic atrophy (GA) considered part of the outcome, rather than a risk feature, and (2) scale separation according to RPD status (determined by validated deep learning grading of color fundus photographs).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Five-year rate of progression to late AMD (defined as neovascular AMD or any GA).
RESULTS: In the AREDS, after the first scale update, the 5-year rates of progression to late AMD for levels 0 to 4 were 0.3%, 4.5%, 12.9%, 32.2%, and 55.6%, respectively. As the final simplified severity scale, the 5-year progression rates for levels 0 to 4 were 0.3%, 4.3%, 11.6%, 26.7%, and 50.0%, respectively, for participants without RPD at baseline and 2.8%, 8.0%, 29.0%, 58.7%, and 72.2%, respectively, for participants with RPD at baseline. In external validation on the AREDS2, for levels 2 to 4, the progression rates were similar: 15.0%, 27.7%, and 45.7% (RPD absent) and 26.2%, 46.0%, and 73.0% (RPD present), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The AREDS AMD simplified severity scale has been modernized with 2 important updates. The new scale for individuals without RPD has 5-year progression rates of approximately 0.5%, 4%, 12%, 25%, and 50%, such that the rates on the original scale remain accurate. The new scale for individuals with RPD has 5-year progression rates of approximately 3%, 8%, 30%, 60%, and 70%, that is, approximately double for most levels. This scale fits updated definitions of late AMD, has increased prognostic accuracy, seems generalizable to similar populations, but remains simple for broad risk categorization.

Although high-resolution knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilitates more precise OA diagnosis, the heterogeneous and multifactorial aspects of OA pathology remain significant obstacles for prognosis. MRI-based scoring systems, while standardizing OA assessment, are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Current AI technologies facilitate knee OA risk scoring and progression prediction, but these often focus on the symptomatic phase of OA, bypassing initial-stage OA prediction. Moreover, their reliance on complex algorithms can hinder clinical interpretation. To this end, we make this effort to construct a computationally efficient, easily-interpretable, and state-of-the-art approach aiding in the radiographic OA (rOA) auto-classification and prediction of the incidence and progression, by contrasting an individual's cartilage thickness with a similar demographic in the rOA-free cohort. To better visualize, we have developed the toolset for both prediction and local visualization. A movie demonstrating different subtypes of dynamic changes in local centile scores during rOA progression is available at https://tli3.github.io/KneeOA/. Specifically, we constructed age-BMI-dependent reference charts for knee OA cartilage thickness, based on MRI scans from 957 radiographic OA (rOA)-free individuals from the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort. Then we extracted local and global centiles by contrasting an individual's cartilage thickness to the rOA-free cohort with a similar age and BMI. Using traditional boosting approaches with our centile-based features, we obtain rOA classification of KLG ≤ 1 versus KLG = 2 (AUC = 0.95, F1 = 0.89), KLG ≤ 1 versus KLG ≥ 2 (AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.82) and prediction of KLG2 progression (AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.94), rOA incidence (KLG increasing from &lt; 2 to ≥ 2; AUC = 0.81, F1 = 0.69) and rOA initial transition (KLG from 0 to 1; AUC = 0.64, F1 = 0.65) within a future 48-month period. Such performance in classifying KLG ≥ 2 matches that of deep learning methods in recent literature. Furthermore, its clinical interpretation suggests that cartilage changes, such as thickening in lateral femoral and anterior femoral regions and thinning in lateral tibial regions, may serve as indicators for prediction of rOA incidence and early progression. Meanwhile, cartilage thickening in the posterior medial and posterior lateral femoral regions, coupled with a reduction in the central medial femoral region, may signify initial phases of rOA transition."

With escalating healthcare costs, early non-invasive CVD risk assessment is vital. Conventional methods have shown poor performance compared to more recent and fast-evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. The proposed study reviews the three most recent paradigms for CVD risk assessment, namely multiclass, multi-label, and ensemble-based methods in (i) office-based and (ii) stress-test laboratories. Methods: A total of 265 CVD-based studies were selected using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model. Due to its popularity and recent development, the study analyzed the above three paradigms using machine learning (ML) frameworks. We review comprehensively these three methods using attributes, such as architecture, applications, pro-and-cons, scientific validation, clinical evaluation, and AI risk-of-bias (RoB) in the CVD framework. These ML techniques were then extended under mobile and cloud-based infrastructure. Findings: Most popular biomarkers used were office-based, laboratory-based, image-based phenotypes, and medication usage. Surrogate carotid scanning for coronary artery risk prediction had shown promising results. Ground truth (GT) selection for AI-based training along with scientific and clinical validation is very important for CVD stratification to avoid RoB. It was observed that the most popular classification paradigm is multiclass followed by the ensemble, and multi-label. The use of deep learning techniques in CVD risk stratification is in a very early stage of development. Mobile and cloud-based AI technologies are more likely to be the future. Conclusions: AI-based methods for CVD risk assessment are most promising and successful. Choice of GT is most vital in AI-based models to prevent the RoB. The amalgamation of image-based strategies with conventional risk factors provides the highest stability when using the three CVD paradigms in non-cloud and cloud-based frameworks."

The present study aimed to analyze, through a systematic literature review, the application of performance of ANN and deep learning in the recognition and automated classification of lesions from clinical images, when comparing to the human performance. The PRISMA 2020 approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) was used by searching four databases of studies that reference the use of IA to define the diagnosis of lesions in ophthalmology, dermatology, and oral medicine areas. A quantitative and qualitative analyses of the articles that met the inclusion criteria were performed. The search yielded the inclusion of 60 studies. It was found that the interest in the topic has increased, especially in the last 3 years. We observed that the performance of IA models is promising, with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, most of them had outcomes equivalent to human comparators. The reproducibility of the performance of models in real-life practice has been reported as a critical point. Study designs and results have been progressively improved. IA resources have the potential to contribute to several areas of health.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate the performance of a convolutional neural network algorithm for SBCE video review in real-life clinical care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter, retrospective diagnostic study, a deep learning neural network (SmartScan) was trained and validated for the SBCE video review. A total of 2927 SBCE examinations from 29 medical centers were used to train SmartScan to detect 17 types of CE structured terminology (CEST) findings from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. SmartScan was later validated with conventional reading (CR) and SmartScan-assisted reading (SSAR) in 2898 SBCE examinations collected from 22 medical centers. Data analysis was performed from January 25 to December 31, 2021.
EXPOSURE: An artificial intelligence-based tool for interpreting clinical images of SBCE.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The detection rate and efficiency of CEST findings detected by SSAR and CR were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 5825 SBCE examinations were retrospectively collected; 2898 examinations (1765 male participants [60.9%]; mean [SD] age, 49.8 [15.5] years) were included in the validation phase. From a total of 6084 CEST-classified SB findings, SSAR detected 5834 findings (95.9%; 95% CI, 95.4%-96.4%), significantly higher than CR, which detected 4630 findings (76.1%; 95% CI, 75.0%-77.2%). SmartScan-assisted reading achieved a higher per-patient detection rate (79.3% [2298 of 2898]) for CEST findings compared with CR (70.7% [2048 of 2298]; 95% CI, 69.0%-72.3%). With SSAR, the mean (SD) number of images (per SBCE video) requiring review was reduced to 779.2 (337.2) compared with 27 910.8 (12 882.9) with CR, for a mean (SD) reduction rate of 96.1% (4.3%). The mean (SD) reading time with SSAR was shortened to 5.4 (1.5) minutes compared with CR (51.4 [11.6] minutes), for a mean (SD) reduction rate of 89.3% (3.1%).

Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care."

Genetic variations in CYP2D6 are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making CYP2D6 one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to CYP2D6 haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of CYP2D6 haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts CYP2D6 haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in in vitro functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers."

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several next-generation AI products indicated for BCS in recent years; however, questions regarding their accuracy, appropriate use, and clinical utility remain.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the current FDA regulatory process for AI products, summarize the evidence used to support FDA clearance and approval of AI products indicated for BCS, consider the advantages and limitations of current regulatory approaches, and suggest ways to improve the current system.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Premarket notifications and other publicly available documents used for FDA clearance and approval of AI products indicated for BCS from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021.
FINDINGS: Nine AI products indicated for BCS for identification of suggestive lesions and mammogram triage were included. Most of the products had been cleared through the 510(k) pathway, and all clearances were based on previously collected retrospective data; 6 products used multicenter designs; 7 products used enriched data; and 4 lacked details on whether products were externally validated. Test performance measures, including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, were the main outcomes reported. Most of the devices used tissue biopsy as the criterion standard for BCS accuracy evaluation. Other clinical outcome measures, including cancer stage at diagnosis and interval cancer detection, were not reported for any of the devices.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this review suggest important gaps in reporting of data sources, data set type, validation approach, and clinical utility assessment. As AI-assisted reading becomes more widespread in BCS and other radiologic examinations, strengthened FDA evidentiary regulatory standards, development of postmarketing surveillance, a focus on clinically meaningful outcomes, and stakeholder engagement will be critical for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these products."

Many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as computer-aided diagnostic systems (CAD), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) have been used to assist in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, but whether AI techniques can improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules still needs to be explored.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the accuracy of AI-based thyroid nodule US images for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules.
METHODS: A search strategy of ""subject terms + key words"" was used to search PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for studies on AI-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules based on US images. The summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the pooled sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of the diagnostic tests. The quality assessment of diagnostics accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 15 were used to process the data. Subgroup analysis was based on the integrity of data collection.
RESULTS: A total of 25 studies with 17,429 US images of thyroid nodules were included. AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had better diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI: (0.85-0.90)), specificity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 30 (95% CI: 19-46). The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Threshold effect analysis showed a Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.17 < 0.5, suggesting no threshold effect for the included studies. After a meta-regression analysis of 4 different subgroups, the results showed a statistically significant effect of mean age ≥50 years on heterogeneity. Compared with studies with an average age of ≥50 years, AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had higher diagnostic performance in studies with an average age of <50 years (0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.88)), (0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.88) vs. 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60-0.87)).
CONCLUSIONS: AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had good diagnostic efficacy for thyroid nodules. For the diagnosis of <50 year olds, AI-assisted diagnostic technology was more effective in diagnosis."

However, a substantial proportion of severe trauma and sepsis survivors will develop protracted organ dysfunction termed chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as ≥14 days requiring intensive care unit (ICU) resources with ongoing organ dysfunction. A subset of CCI patients will develop the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and these individuals are predisposed to a poor quality of life and indolent death. We propose that CCI and PICS after trauma or sepsis are the result of an inappropriate bone marrow response characterized by the generation of dysfunctional myeloid populations at the expense of lympho- and erythropoiesis. This review describes similarities among CCI/PICS phenotypes in sepsis, cancer, and aging and reviews the role of aberrant myelopoiesis in the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS. In addition, we characterize pathogen recognition, the interface between innate and adaptive immune systems, and therapeutic approaches including immune modulators, gut microbiota support, and nutritional and exercise therapy. Finally, we discuss the future of diagnostic and prognostic approaches guided by machine and deep-learning models trained and validated on big data to identify patients for whom these approaches will yield the greatest benefits. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS and continued investigation into novel therapies harbor the potential to improve the current dismal long-term outcomes for critically ill post-injury and post-infection patients."

The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings."

The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization3,4. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation5,6,7,8. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)9, augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization6,10. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain."

The BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge focuses on benchmarking the development of volumentric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain glioma through standardized quantitative performance evaluation metrics utilized across the BraTS 2023 cluster of challenges. Models gaining knowledge from the BraTS-PEDs multi-parametric structural MRI (mpMRI) training data will be evaluated on separate validation and unseen test mpMRI dataof high-grade pediatric glioma. The CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge brings together clinicians and AI/imaging scientists to lead to faster development of automated segmentation techniques that could benefit clinical trials, and ultimately the care of children with brain tumors."

Artificial intelligence (AI) could enable fSAD quantification from chest CT scan at total lung capacity (TLC) alone (fSADTLC).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an AI model for estimating fSADTLC and study its clinical associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We analyzed 2513 participants from the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). Using a subset (n = 1055), we developed a generative model to produce virtual expiratory CTs for estimating fSADTLC in the remaining 1458 SPIROMICS participants. We compared fSADTLC with dual volume, parametric response mapping fSADPRM. We investigated univariate and multivariable associations of fSADTLC with FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline. The results were validated in a subset (n = 458) from COPDGene study. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, smoking pack years, smoking status, and percent emphysema.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Inspiratory fSADTLC was highly correlated with fSADPRM in SPIROMICS (Pearson's R = 0.895) and COPDGene (R = 0.897) cohorts. In SPIROMICS, fSADTLC was associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> (L) (adj.β = -0.034, P &lt; 0.001), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (adj.β = -0.008, P &lt; 0.001), SGRQ (adj.β = 0.243, P &lt; 0.001), and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline (mL / year) (adj.β = -1.156, P &lt; 0.001). fSADTLC was also associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> (L) (adj.β = -0.032, P &lt; 0.001), FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (adj.β = -0.007, P &lt; 0.001), SGRQ (adj.β = 0.190, P = 0.02), and FEV<sub>1</sub> decline (mL / year) (adj.β = -0.866, P = 0.001) in COPDGene. We found fSADTLC to be more repeatable than fSADPRM with intraclass correlation of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 0.99) vs. 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Inspiratory fSADTLC captures small airways disease as reliably as fSADPRM and is associated with FEV<sub>1</sub> decline."

Could a polygenic prediction of ascending aortic diameter improve detection of aortic aneurysm?
METHODS: Deep learning was used to measure ascending thoracic aortic diameter in 49,939 UK Biobank participants. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 39,524 participants and leveraged to build a 1.1 million-variant polygenic score with PRScs-auto. Aortic diameter prediction models were built with the polygenic score (""AORTA Gene"") and without it. The models were tested in a held-out set of 4,962 UK Biobank participants and externally validated in 5,469 participants from Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGB), 1,298 from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), and 610 participants from All of Us.
RESULTS: In each test set, the AORTA Gene model explained more of the variance in thoracic aortic diameter compared to clinical factors alone: 39.9% (95% CI 37.8-42.0%) vs 29.2% (95% CI 27.1-31.4%) in UK Biobank, 36.5% (95% CI 34.4-38.5%) vs 32.5% (95% CI 30.4-34.5%) in MGB, 41.8% (95% CI 37.7-45.9%) vs 33.0% (95% CI 28.9-37.2%) in FHS, and 34.9% (95% CI 28.8-41.0%) vs 28.9% (95% CI 22.9-35.0%) in All of Us. AORTA Gene had a greater AUROC for identifying diameter ≥4cm in each test set: 0.834 vs 0.765 (P=7.3E-10) in UK Biobank, 0.808 vs 0.767 in MGB (P=4.5E-12), 0.856 vs 0.818 in FHS (P=8.5E-05), and 0.827 vs 0.791 (P=7.8E-03) in All of Us.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic information improved estimation of thoracic aortic diameter when added to clinical risk factors. Larger and more diverse cohorts will be needed to develop more powerful and equitable scores."

The average survival span is just 14 days from the time the symptoms become aggressive. The present study delineates the deep-driven vascular damage in the pulmonary, renal, coronary, and carotid vessels due to SARS-CoV-2. This special report addresses an important gap in the literature in understanding (i) the pathophysiology of vascular damage and the role of medical imaging in the visualization of the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, and (ii) further understanding the severity of COVID-19 using artificial intelligence (AI)-based tissue characterization (TC). PRISMA was used to select 296 studies for AI-based TC. Radiological imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound were selected for imaging of the vasculature infected by COVID-19. Four kinds of hypotheses are presented for showing the vascular damage in radiological images due to COVID-19. Three kinds of AI models, namely, machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning, are used for TC. Further, the study presents recommendations for improving AI-based architectures for vascular studies. We conclude that the process of vascular damage due to COVID-19 has similarities across vessel types, even though it results in multi-organ dysfunction. Although the mortality rate is ~2% of those infected, the long-term effect of COVID-19 needs monitoring to avoid deaths. AI seems to be penetrating the health care industry at warp speed, and we expect to see an emerging role in patient care, reduce the mortality and morbidity rate."

Epub 2023 Feb 24.,Ter Maat LS,Eur J Cancer,2023,2023/03/30,,,10.1016/j.ejca.2023.02.017,"INTRODUCTION: Predicting checkpoint inhibitors treatment outcomes in melanoma is a relevant task, due to the unpredictable and potentially fatal toxicity and high costs for society. However, accurate biomarkers for treatment outcomes are lacking. Radiomics are a technique to quantitatively capture tumour characteristics on readily available computed tomography (CT) imaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the added value of radiomics for predicting clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma in a large, multicenter cohort.
METHODS: Patients who received first-line anti-PD1±anti-CTLA4 treatment for advanced cutaneous melanoma were retrospectively identified from nine participating hospitals. For every patient, up to five representative lesions were segmented on baseline CT, and radiomics features were extracted. A machine learning pipeline was trained on the radiomics features to predict clinical benefit, defined as stable disease for more than 6 months or response per RECIST 1.1 criteria. This approach was evaluated using a leave-one-centre-out cross validation and compared to a model based on previously discovered clinical predictors. Lastly, a combination model was built on the radiomics and clinical model.
RESULTS: A total of 620 patients were included, of which 59.2% experienced clinical benefit. The radiomics model achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.607 [95% CI, 0.562-0.652], lower than that of the clinical model (AUROC=0.646 [95% CI, 0.600-0.692]). The combination model yielded no improvement over the clinical model in terms of discrimination (AUROC=0.636 [95% CI, 0.592-0.680]) or calibration. The output of the radiomics model was significantly correlated with three out of five input variables of the clinical model (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: The radiomics model achieved a moderate predictive value of clinical benefit, which was statistically significant. However, a radiomics approach was unable to add value to a simpler clinical model, most likely due to the overlap in predictive information learned by both models. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning, spectral CT-derived radiomics, and a multimodal approach for accurately predicting benefit to checkpoint inhibitor treatment in advanced melanoma."

In 2022 and 2023 the first open-to-the-public Genomes to Fields (G2F) initiative Genotype by Environment (GxE) prediction competition was held using a large dataset including genomic variation, phenotype and weather measurements and field management notes, gathered by the project over nine years. The competition attracted registrants from around the world with representation from academic, government, industry, and non-profit institutions as well as unaffiliated. These participants came from diverse disciplines include plant science, animal science, breeding, statistics, computational biology and others. Some participants had no formal genetics or plant-related training, and some were just beginning their graduate education. The teams applied varied methods and strategies, providing a wealth of modeling knowledge based on a common dataset. The winner's strategy involved two models combining machine learning and traditional breeding tools: one model emphasized environment using features extracted by Random Forest, Ridge Regression and Least-squares, and one focused on genetics. Other high-performing teams' methods included quantitative genetics, classical machine learning/deep learning, mechanistic models, and model ensembles. The dataset factors used, such as genetics; weather; and management data, were also diverse, demonstrating that no single model or strategy is far superior to all others within the context of this competition."

Screening and treatment reduces this risk, but requires multiple examinations of infants, most of whom will not develop severe disease. Previous work has suggested that artificial intelligence may be able to detect incident severe disease (treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity [TR-ROP]) before clinical diagnosis. We aimed to build a risk model that combined artificial intelligence with clinical demographics to reduce the number of examinations without missing cases of TR-ROP.
METHODS: Infants undergoing routine ROP screening examinations (1579 total eyes, 190 with TR-ROP) were recruited from 8 North American study centers. A vascular severity score (VSS) was derived from retinal fundus images obtained at 32 to 33 weeks' postmenstrual age. Seven ElasticNet logistic regression models were trained on all combinations of birth weight, gestational age, and VSS. The area under the precision-recall curve was used to identify the highest-performing model.
RESULTS: The gestational age + VSS model had the highest performance (mean ± SD area under the precision-recall curve: 0.35 ± 0.11). On 2 different test data sets (n = 444 and n = 132), sensitivity was 100% (positive predictive value: 28.1% and 22.6%) and specificity was 48.9% and 80.8% (negative predictive value: 100.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Using a single examination, this model identified all infants who developed TR-ROP, on average, >1 month before diagnosis with moderate to high specificity. This approach could lead to earlier identification of incident severe ROP, reducing late diagnosis and treatment while simultaneously reducing the number of ROP examinations and unnecessary physiologic stress for low-risk infants."

METHODS: A blinded validation study was performed using prostate lung colorectal ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial data and biospecimens to evaluate the performance of a four-marker protein panel (4MP) consisting of the precursor form of surfactant protein B, cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cytokeratin-19 fragment in combination with a lung cancer risk prediction model (PLCO<sub>m2012</sub>) compared with current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening criteria. The 4MP was assayed in 1,299 sera collected preceding lung cancer diagnosis and 8,709 noncase sera.
RESULTS: The 4MP alone yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.82) for case sera collected within 1-year preceding diagnosis and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.76) among the entire specimen set. The combined 4MP + PLCO<sub>m2012</sub> model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.88) for case sera collected within 1 year preceding diagnosis. The benefit of the 4MP in the combined model resulted from improvement in sensitivity at high specificity. Compared with the USPSTF2021 criteria, the combined 4MP + PLCO<sub>m2012</sub> model exhibited statistically significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity. Among PLCO participants with ≥ 10 smoking pack-years, the 4MP + PLCO<sub>m2012</sub> model would have identified for annual screening 9.2% more lung cancer cases and would have reduced referral by 13.7% among noncases compared with USPSTF2021 criteria.
CONCLUSION: A blood-based biomarker panel in combination with PLCO<sub>m2012</sub> significantly improves lung cancer risk assessment for lung cancer screening."

How computational assessments of TILs might complement manual TIL assessment in trial and daily practices is currently debated. Recent efforts to use machine learning (ML) to automatically evaluate TILs have shown promising results. We review state-of-the-art approaches and identify pitfalls and challenges of automated TIL evaluation by studying the root cause of ML discordances in comparison to manual TIL quantification. We categorize our findings into four main topics: (1) technical slide issues, (2) ML and image analysis aspects, (3) data challenges, and (4) validation issues. The main reason for discordant assessments is the inclusion of false-positive areas or cells identified by performance on certain tissue patterns or design choices in the computational implementation. To aid the adoption of ML for TIL assessment, we provide an in-depth discussion of ML and image analysis, including validation issues that need to be considered before reliable computational reporting of TILs can be incorporated into the trial and routine clinical management of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. © 2023 The Authors.

We quantified cross-sectional regional cerebellar lobule volumes using structural MRI in 1,602 adults with epilepsy and 1,022 healthy controls across twenty-two sites from the global ENIGMA-Epilepsy working group.
METHODS: A state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach was employed that parcellates the cerebellum into 28 neuroanatomical subregions. Linear mixed models compared total and regional cerebellar volume in i) all epilepsies; ii) temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS); iii) non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE-NL); iv) genetic generalised epilepsy; and (v) extra-temporal focal epilepsy (ETLE). Relationships were examined for cerebellar volume versus age at seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, phenytoin treatment, and cerebral cortical thickness.
RESULTS: Across all epilepsies, reduced total cerebellar volume was observed (d=0.42). Maximum volume loss was observed in the corpus medullare (d<sub>max</sub>=0.49) and posterior lobe grey matter regions, including bilateral lobules VIIB (d<sub>max</sub>= 0.47), Crus I/II (d<sub>max</sub>= 0.39), VIIIA (d<sub>max</sub>=0.45) and VIIIB (d<sub>max</sub>=0.40). Earlier age at seizure onset (ηρ2<sub>max</sub>=0.05) and longer epilepsy duration (ηρ2<sub>max</sub>=0.06) correlated with reduced volume in these regions. Findings were most pronounced in TLE-HS and ETLE with distinct neuroanatomical profiles observed in the posterior lobe. Phenytoin treatment was associated with reduced posterior lobe volume. Cerebellum volume correlated with cerebral cortical thinning more strongly in the epilepsy cohort than in controls.
SIGNIFICANCE: We provide robust evidence of deep cerebellar and posterior lobe subregional grey matter volume loss in patients with chronic epilepsy. Volume loss was maximal for posterior subregions implicated in non-motor functions, relative to motor regions of both the anterior and posterior lobe. Associations between cerebral and cerebellar changes, and variability of neuroanatomical profiles across epilepsy syndromes argue for more precise incorporation of cerebellum subregions into neurobiological models of epilepsy."

Here, we review current efforts to evaluate the predictive validity of omic biomarkers of aging in population studies, discuss challenges in comparability and generalizability and provide recommendations to facilitate future validation of biomarkers of aging. Finally, we discuss how systematic validation can accelerate clinical translation of biomarkers of aging and their use in gerotherapeutic clinical trials."

METHODS: This prospective multicenter observational study enrolled consecutive adult patients admitted to 11 intensive care units in nine countries. At all sites, daily clinical data with emphasis on GI clinical symptoms were collected and intra-abdominal pressure measured. In five out of 11 sites, the biomarkers citrulline and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) were measured additionally. Cox models with time-dependent scores were used to analyze associations with 28- and 90-day mortality. The models were estimated with stratification for study center.
RESULTS: We included 540 patients (224 with biomarker measurements) with median age of 65 years (range 18-94), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score of 38 (interquartile range 26-53) points, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (interquartile range 3-9) points at admission. Median ICU length of stay was 3 (interquartile range 1-6) days and 90-day mortality 18.9%. A new five grade Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Score (GIDS) was developed based on the rationale of the previously developed Acute GI Injury (AGI) grading. Citrulline and I-FABP did not prove their potential for scoring of GI dysfunction in critically ill. GIDS was independently associated with 28- and 90-day mortality when added to SOFA total score (HR 1.40; 95%CI 1.07-1.84 and HR 1.40; 95%CI 1.02-1.79, respectively) or to a model containing all SOFA subscores (HR 1.48; 95%CI 1.13-1.92 and HR 1.47; 95%CI 1.15-1.87, respectively), improving predictive power of SOFA score in all analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed GIDS is additive to SOFA score in prediction of 28- and 90-day mortality. The clinical usefulness of this score should be validated prospectively.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of drinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies.
METHODS: We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results.
DISCUSSION: Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1090."

However, an association between treatment response of aGI-GVHD and the intestinal microbiota has not been well-studied. In a cohort of patients with aGI-GVHD (n=37), we found that non-response to standard therapy with corticosteroids was associated with prior treatment with carbapenem antibiotics and loss of Bacteroides ovatus from the microbiome. In a mouse model of carbapenem-aggravated GVHD, introducing Bacteroides ovatus reduced severity of GVHD and improved survival. Bacteroides ovatus reduced degradation of colonic mucus by another intestinal commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, via its ability to metabolize dietary polysaccharides into monosaccharides, which then inhibit mucus degradation by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and reduce GVHD-related mortality."

We sought to identify the overall impact of AGIs with respect to incident type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and CV outcomes in those with IGT or type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: We used PubMed and SCOPUS to identify randomized controlled trials reporting the incidence of type 2 diabetes and/or CV outcomes that had compared AGIs with placebo in populations with IGT or type 2 diabetes, with or without established CV disease. Eligible studies were required to have ≥ 500 participants and/or ≥ 100 endpoints of interest. Meta-analyses of available trial data were performed using random effects models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident type 2 diabetes and CV outcomes.
RESULTS: Of ten trials identified, three met our inclusion criteria for incident type 2 diabetes and four were eligible for CV outcomes. The overall HR (95% CI) comparing AGI with placebo for incident type 2 diabetes was 0.77 (0.67-0.88), p &lt; 0.0001, and for CV outcomes was 0.98 (0.89-1.10), p = 0.85.

METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched to identify trials that assessed gastrointestinal injury in critically ill patients. Outcome measures were prevalence of AGI among critically ill patients; incidence of mortality among critically ill patients with AGI, and incidence of mortality stratified by severity of AGI.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 14 studies. The prevalence of AGI in critically ill patients was 40% [95% confidence interval (CI), 27%-54%]; the incidence of mortality among critically ill patients with AGI was 33% (95% CI, 26%-41%). There was a higher risk of mortality in critically ill patients with AGI compared to those without AGI [risk ratio (RR) = 2.01; 95% CI 1.20-3.37, P = .008). Subgroup analyses of studies that defined AGI according to European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) criteria confirmed these findings and showed that the risk of mortality was higher in critically ill patients with more severe AGI (ESICM grade III and IV vs grade II) [RR of 1.86 (95% CI 1.48-2.34), P < .00001].
CONCLUSION: AGI is common in critically ill patients, mortality in critically ill patients with AGI is high, and severity of AGI is associated with mortality. The widespread clinical use of standard criteria with a severity gradation will facilitate the diagnosis and management of AGI in critically ill patients."

However, inaccuracies in medical notes can lead to miscommunication and diagnostic errors. Additionally, the demands of documentation contribute to physician burnout. Although intermediaries like medical scribes and speech recognition software have been used to ease this burden, they have limitations in terms of accuracy and addressing provider-specific metrics. The integration of ambient artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions offers a promising way to improve documentation while fitting seamlessly into existing workflows.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the accuracy and quality of Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) notes generated by ChatGPT-4, an AI model, using established transcripts of History and Physical Examination as the gold standard. We seek to identify potential errors and evaluate the model's performance across different categories.
METHODS: We conducted simulated patient-provider encounters representing various ambulatory specialties and transcribed the audio files. Key reportable elements were identified, and ChatGPT-4 was used to generate SOAP notes based on these transcripts. Three versions of each note were created and compared to the gold standard via chart review; errors generated from the comparison were categorized as omissions, incorrect information, or additions. We compared the accuracy of data elements across versions, transcript length, and data categories. Additionally, we assessed note quality using the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI) scoring system.
RESULTS: Although ChatGPT-4 consistently generated SOAP-style notes, there were, on average, 23.6 errors per clinical case, with errors of omission (86%) being the most common, followed by addition errors (10.5%) and inclusion of incorrect facts (3.2%). There was significant variance between replicates of the same case, with only 52.9% of data elements reported correctly across all 3 replicates. The accuracy of data elements varied across cases, with the highest accuracy observed in the ""Objective"" section. Consequently, the measure of note quality, assessed by PDQI, demonstrated intra- and intercase variance. Finally, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 was inversely correlated to both the transcript length (P=.05) and the number of scorable data elements (P=.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals substantial variability in errors, accuracy, and note quality generated by ChatGPT-4. Errors were not limited to specific sections, and the inconsistency in error types across replicates complicated predictability. Transcript length and data complexity were inversely correlated with note accuracy, raising concerns about the model's effectiveness in handling complex medical cases. The quality and reliability of clinical notes produced by ChatGPT-4 do not meet the standards required for clinical use. Although AI holds promise in health care, caution should be exercised before widespread adoption. Further research is needed to address accuracy, variability, and potential errors. ChatGPT-4, while valuable in various applications, should not be considered a safe alternative to human-generated clinical documentation at this time."

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally."

We sought to determine risk factors for aortic graft infection (AGI), the long-term outcomes in patients managed both nonoperatively and via explantation.
METHODS: This observational study reviewed sequential aortic grafts (thoracic or abdominal) inserted via open or endovascular means between 2000 and 2017. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to compare risk factors between groups who did and did not acquire an AGI and recorded method of management, morbidity, mortality, and duration to adverse event.
RESULTS: There were 883 aortic repairs, 49% were endovascular. 17.2% were for ruptured aneurysms, 1.1% for symptomatic aneurysms, 1.4% for type B dissections, and 0.5% for occlusive disease. Twelve patients presented with AGI, of which ten had their index procedure performed at our institution (AGI incidence of 1.1%). There was no difference in rates of AGI between open and endovascular repairs (0.9 vs. 1.4%, P = 0.24). AGI was significantly associated with emergency aortic repair (HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.13-11.57, P = 0.03), septic process requiring in-patient management during follow-up (HR 5.44, 95% CI 1.21-24.26, P = 0.02), and suprarenal clamping during open repair (HR 5.21, 95% CI 1.00-26.99, P = 0.05). Four patients were managed with explantation and revascularization (3 extra-anatomical bypasses) and remained well at a median follow-up of 46 months. Of the 8 patients managed nonoperatively, 4 died at an average of 13.5 days after representation, and the other 4 remained well on oral antibiotics at a median follow-up of 26.5 months. No patient suffered limb loss, and there was no change in the rate of infection over the period.
CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of AGI remains low but is associated with significant mortality. Patients with aortic grafts in situ require aggressive treatment of septic foci to prevent graft infection."

METHODS: One hundred sixty seven patients with un-resectable HCC were retrospectively analyzed to identify factors that might contribute to their HCC biology and aggressiveness. We correlated routine laboratory results (total bilirubin, AST, ALKP, GGTP, albumin etc.) to maximum tumor diameter, number of tumor nodules, portal vein thrombosis and blood alpha-fetoprotein levels. These 4 parameters were previously combined to form an aggressiveness index (AgI). We used The Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney), to test the correlation between the AgI categories and liver function parameters. The Cox proportional hazards model was applied to evaluate the categories of AgI associated with overall survival.
RESULTS: The AgI was strongly correlated with survival in this novel patient population. Three year survival probability for AgI &gt; or &lt; 4 was 42.4% vs 61.8%; P &lt; 0.0863 respectively. Several factors independently correlated with AgI using univariate multiple logistic regression of AgI with 8 laboratory parameters. Lower albumin levels had an OR of 2.56 (95%CI: 1.120-5.863 P &lt; 0.026), elevated Alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) had ORs of 1.01 (95%CI: 1.003-1.026, P &lt; 0.017) and 0.99 (95%CI: 0.99-1.00, P &lt; 0.053) respectively. In a Cox proportional hazard model combining mortality for AgI score and liver function parameters, only GGTP levels and the AgI were independently associated with survival. An AgI &gt; 4 had HR for mortality of 2.18 (95%CI: 1.108-4.310, P &lt; 0.024). GGTP's single unit change had a HR for mortality of 1.003 (95%CI: 1.001-1.006, P &lt; 0.016).

Our aim was to describe the association of nutritional intake and GI symptoms during first 14 days of ICU admission.
METHODS: Observational study including critically ill adult COVID-19 patients. Data on nutritional intake [enteral nutrition (EN) or parenteral nutrition] and GI symptoms were collected during 14 days after ICU admission. Target energy and protein feeding goals were calculated conform ESPEN guidelines. GI symptoms included GRV (ml/d), vomiting, abdominal distension, and faeces (ml/d). High GRV's were classified as ≥2 times ≥150 ml/d and diarrhea as Bristol stool chart ≥6. GI symptoms were defined as mild if at least one symptom occurred and as moderate when ≥2 symptoms occurred. Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grades of III were classified as GI dysfunction and grades of IV were considered as GI failure with severe impact on distant organs. Linear mixed model analysis was performed to explore the development of nutritional intake and GI symptoms over time at day (D) 0, 4, 10, and 14.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty patients were included [75% male; median age 64 years (IQR 54-70)]. BMI upon admission was 28 kg/m2 (IQR 25-33), of which 43% obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2). Most patients received EN during admission (98% D4; 96% D10-14). Mean energy goals increased from 87% at D4 to 93% D10-14 and protein goals (g/kg) were increasingly achieved during admission (84% D4; 93% D10-14). Presence of moderate GI symptoms decreased (10% D0; 6% D4-10; 5% D14), reversely mild GI symptoms increased. Occurrence of GI dysfunction fluctuated (1% D0; 18% D4; 12% D10; 8% D14) and none of patients developed grade IV GI failure. Development of high GRV fluctuated (5% D0; 23% D4; 14% D10; 8% D14) and occurrence of diarrhea slightly increased during admission (5% D0; 22% D4; 25% D10; 27% D14). Linear mixed models showed only an association between AGI grades III and lower protein intake at day 10 (p = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: Occurrence of GI symptoms was limited and seems no major barrier for EN in our group of critically COVID-19 patients. Nutritional intake was just below requirements during the first 14 days of ICU admission. The effect on nutritional status remains to be studied."

Gastrointestinal function was evaluated using the Acute Gastrointestinal Injury (AGI) grade proposed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study at a single center.
SETTING: University hospital.
PATIENTS: Consecutive patients presenting for elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC).
INTERVENTIONS: None.
RESULTS: Daily assessment using the AGI grade was performed on the first 3 postoperative days in addition to standard care. For analysis, 3 groups were formed based on the maximum AGI grade: AGI 0, AGI 1, and AGI ≥2. Five hundred and one patients completed the study; 32.7%, 65.1%, and 2.2% of the patients scored a maximum AGI 0, AGI 1, and AGI ≥2, respectively. Patients with AGI grade ≥2 had more frequently undergone thoracic aortic surgery and had longer surgery duration and time on ECC. Patients with AGI grade ≥2 had statistically significant higher frequency of GI complications within 30 days (63.6% vs 1.2% and 5.5% in patients with AGI 0 and AGI 1) and higher 30-day mortality (9.1% vs 0.0% and 1.8% in patients with AGI 0 and AGI 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Early GI dysfunction following cardiac surgery was associated with an unfavorable outcome. Increased attention to GI dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients is warranted and the AGI grade could be a helpful adjunct to a structured approach."

Epub 2020 May 18.,Li H,Clin Nutr,2021,2020/06/04,,,10.1016/j.clnu.2020.05.011,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The impact of nutrition support on patients with acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) has not been fully determined. This study aimed to 1) investigate the relationship between nutrition support and AGI, as well as nutrition support and prognosis in critically ill AGI patients and 2) evaluate the prognostic benefits of nutrition support in different severity categories of AGI patients.
METHODS: This prospective study included 379 patients in whom AGI occurred in the first 72 h after admission from 12 teaching hospitals in China. Clinical characteristics including demographics, APACHE II score, modified NUTRIC score, SOFA score, calories of nutrition, and 7 and 28-day mortality were recorded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the risk factors for mortality. The survival benefit of nutrition support as reflected by calories of nutrition in 72 h was evaluated for patients categorized according to their APACHE II, modified NUTRIC, and SOFA scores.
RESULTS: Patients were classified into Grades I (n = 141), II (n = 173), III (n = 48), and IV (n = 17). Significant differences were observed among different AGI grade cohorts (I-IV) in terms of APACHE II, SOFA, and modified NUTRIC scores and calories of enteral nutrition (EN), parenteral nutrition (PN), and EN + PN. Ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that only SOFA score was an independent risk factor for AGI grades (P < 0.001). APACHE II score, mechanical ventilation (MV), AGI grades, and calories of EN + PN intake were independent risk factors for 28-d mortality. Increased nutritional intake was associated with reduced mortality in severely ill patients with APACHE II scores ≥15 (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: AGI grade affected the intake of calories and was one of the risk factors for 28-d mortality. The nutrition intake of patients with AGI grade III to IV was almost only PN. The positive association between nutrition support and prognosis was more apparent in AGI patients with higher APACHE II scores."

Epub 2016 Apr 21.,Gupta PK,Vasc Endovascular Surg,2016,2016/04/23,,,10.1177/1538574416637443,"BACKGROUND: Literature on postoperative outcomes following aortic surgery for aortic graft infection (AGI) is limited by relatively small sample sizes, resulting in lack of national benchmarks for quality of care. We report in-hospital outcomes following abdominal aortic surgery for AGI and identify factors associated with postoperative complications using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database.
METHODS: Patients who underwent aortic graft resection for AGI were identified from the 2002 to 2008 NIS database, a multicenter database capturing 20% of all US admissions. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Among 394 patients (men: 73.4%) who underwent abdominal aortic surgery for AGI, 53% of the admissions were emergent/urgent. A significant trend for decreasing number of abdominal aortic surgery for AGIs per year was observed (Pearson r correlation: -.96; P = .0006). Over the same time span, a significant correlation was also seen with decrease in open and increase in endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs in the NIS database. In-hospital rates of overall postoperative morbidity and mortality were 68.3% and 19.8%, respectively. In-hospital rates of postoperative respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiac arrest were 35.5%, 14.2%, and 8.9%, respectively. Median length of stay was 26 days, with median hospital charges being US$184 162. On multivariable analysis, increase in age per year (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.12) was independently associated with postoperative morbidity, while higher hospital volume for this procedure was protective (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.89). No preoperative factors were independently associated with postoperative mortality.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of abdominal aortic surgery for AGI has progressively declined over the span of our study in association with decreased open and increased endovascular aortic aneurysm repairs. Aortic surgery for AGI is associated with very high morbidity and mortality rates along with prolonged lengths of stay and elevated hospital charges. The outcomes of operations for AGI are better in younger patients and higher volume hospitals."

Among many modeling approaches, spectral graph model (SGM) is distinctive as it has a closed-form solution of the wide-band frequency spectra of brain oscillations, requiring only global biophysically interpretable parameters. While SGM is parsimonious in parameters, the determination of SGM parameters is non-trivial. Prior works on SGM determine the parameters through a computational intensive annealing algorithm, which only provides a point estimate with no confidence intervals for parameter estimates. To fill this gap, we incorporate the simulation-based inference (SBI) algorithm and develop a Bayesian procedure for inferring the posterior distribution of the SGM parameters. Furthermore, using SBI dramatically reduces the computational burden for inferring the SGM parameters. We evaluate the proposed SBI-SGM framework on the resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings from healthy subjects and show that the proposed procedure has similar performance to the annealing algorithm in recovering power spectra and the spatial distribution of the alpha frequency band. In addition, we also analyze the correlations among the parameters and their uncertainty with the posterior distribution which can not be done with annealing inference. These analyses provide a richer understanding of the interactions among biophysical parameters of the SGM. In general, the use of simulation-based Bayesian inference enables robust and efficient computations of generative model parameter uncertainties and may pave the way for the use of generative models in clinical translation applications."

Epub 2021 Jun 25.,Filiberto AC,Ann Vasc Surg,2021,2021/06/28,,,10.1016/j.avsg.2021.04.047,"BACKGROUND: Aortic graft infection (AGI) is a rare but devastating complication requiring both explant of the infected prosthesis and lower extremity revascularization. Despite a variety of methods to treat AGI, there is a paucity of evidence that describes comparative outcomes. Moreover, controversy exists surrounding what the optimal repair strategy is with limited descriptions of how these techniques should be employed in this complex group of patients. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to review our experience with AGI management while highlighting a practice philosophy that can achieve acceptable outcomes.
METHODS: All AGI patients between 2002-2019 were reviewed. The primary end-point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end-points included complications, re-infection, unplanned re-operation and all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate time to events. Cox regression models were employed to identify association between patient factors and operative strategy with survival. Subgroup analysis included outcome comparison among four different operative approaches(extra-anatomic bypass with aortic ligation [EAB] and in-situ reconstruction [ISR] using either NAIS, cryopreserved allograft [Cryo], or antibiotic-soaked prosthetic grafts [Other]).
RESULTS: 142 patients (male-69%, mean age 67 ± 11 years) were reviewed. Median time to AGI presentation was 52 (IQR 16-128) months. ISR was performed in 70% (n = 99)[ISR: NAIS-49% (n = 49), Cryo, 33% (n = 33) and Other-23% (n = 23)]. EAB was used in 26% (n = 37), of which 57% (n = 21) were staged repairs[no reconstruction, 4%: intraoperative death-2, AGI removal without reconstruction-2]. A graft enteric erosion/fistula was identified in 39% (n = 55). Mean follow-up time was 14 ± 27 (median 2.2[IQR 0.1-16]) months. Overall, 30-day mortality was 21% and 69% (n = 98) experienced a complication. The most common complications were pulmonary (35%;n = 50), vascular (28%;n = 39), gastrointestinal (22%;n = 31) and renal (21%;n = 30). Freedom from re-infection at one and three years was 78 ± 5% and 73 ± 6% while freedom from unplanned re-operation was 50 ± 5% and 40 ± 6%, respectively. Corresponding one- and five-year freedom from all-cause mortality was 67 ± 4% and 53 ± 4%. When stratified by the four different repair strategies, unadjusted rates of postoperative complications and mortality were not different. However, EAB patients had more renal complications. All-cause mortality predictors included age (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.1; P = 0.003), CHF (HR 2.7, 1.3-5.7; P = 0.01), and graft enteric erosion/fistula (HR 2.2, 1.3-3.8;P = 0.005) while total graft excision was protective (HR 0.34, 0.2-0.7; P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: AGI repair, regardless of operative strategy, results in significant early morbidity, and mortality. The need for unplanned re-operation is common; however, long-term survival is acceptable in appropriately selected patients. Re-infection risk mandates life-long surveillance and consideration of indefinite anti-microbial suppression in certain subgroups. Due to the complexity and intensity of care, all AGI should be treated, when possible, at centers performing high-volume aortic surgery."

This study aims to examine the frequency, risk factors, and clinical implications of AGI in elderly polytrauma patients. Methods: A retrospective, observational, multicenter study was carried out in two Level I trauma centers, encompassing a cohort of 1054 polytrauma patients from July 2020 to April 2022. Results: A total of 965 consecutive polytrauma patients were recruited who were divided into youth group (n=746) and elderly group (n=219). 73.5% of elderly patients after polytrauma were accompanied by AGI. An increasing ISS (OR=2.957, 95%CI: 1.285-7.714), SI (OR=2.861, 95%CI: 1.372-5.823), serum lactate (OR=2.547, 95%CI: 1.254-5.028), IL-6 (OR=1.771, 95%CI: 1.145-8.768), APTT (OR=1.462, 95%CI: 1.364-4.254) and a decreasing GCS (OR=0.325, 95%CI: 0.116-0.906) were each associated with an increasing risk of AGI in elderly polytrauma patients. Elderly polytrauma patients with AGI were presented relatively high 28-day mortality (40.4%) and super high 60-day mortality (61.2%) compared with elderly group without AGI and youth group with AGI. The area under the curve for predicting 28-day mortality in elderly polytrauma patients with AGI was 0.93 for AGI-III,IV with 96% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Conclusion: Elderly patients have a higher incidence and a worse prognosis of AGI after polytrauma. ISS, GCS, SI, serum lactate, IL-6, and APTT are identified as reliable prognostic markers to distinguish the AGI and N-AGI in elderly polytrauma patients. AGI-III,IV was the independent predictor of mortality in elderly polytrauma patients with AGI."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify effects of alpha-glucosidase-inhibiting (AGI) drugs on acute PPG and PPI responses.
METHODS: We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE until March 13, 2018 for controlled studies using AGI drugs together with a standardized carbohydrate load or mixed meal. The mean incremental PPG and PPI levels were calculated as outcomes. Meta-analyses, stratified by diabetes state, were performed by using random effects models.
RESULTS: The 66 included publications comprised 127 drug-control comparisons for PPG, and 106 for PPI, mostly testing acarbose or miglitol. The absolute effects on PPG were larger among individuals with diabetes (-1.5 mmol/l mean PPG [95% CI -1.9, -1.1] by acarbose, and -1.6 [-1.9, -1.4] by miglitol) as compared to individuals without diabetes (-0.4 [95% CI -0.5, -0.3] by acarbose, and -0.6 [-0.8, -0.4] by miglitol). Relative reductions in PPG by both drugs were similar for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals (43-54%). Acarbose and miglitol also significantly reduced mean PPI, with absolute and relative reductions being largest among individuals without diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analyses provide quantitative estimates of reductions of PPG and PPI responses by AGI drugs in diabetes and non-diabetic individuals. These data can serve as benchmarks for clinically relevant reductions in PPG and PPI via drug or diet and lifestyle interventions."

We identified clinical factors predictive of increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with FD targeted to improve clinical outcomes. Ninety-five patients studied over a median follow-up time of 6.3 years, and 26 patients reached the composite endpoint with a high prevalence of heart failure and cerebrovascular events and no cardiac-related mortality. Patients with MACE had worse health-related quality of life scores. Hypertrophy and presence of myocardial fibrosis increase risk of MACE by 4-5 times, and dyslipidemia increases risk of MACE by 3 times. Early Fabry-specific treatment and close monitoring of comorbidities reduce cardiac complications and mortality. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive multidisciplinary management to help improve outcomes in FD patients."

This study aimed to study traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) bundle therapy (based on TCM syndrome differentiation) as add-on to conventional treatments on the incidence of AGI and on the prognosis of patients with sepsis.
DESIGN: This was a prospective multicenter randomized single-blind controlled trial.
SETTING: Intensive care units (ICUs) of five university teaching hospitals in Zhejiang Province (China) from December 2012 to December 2014.
INTERVENTIONS: The control group received conventional treatment for sepsis and AGI. The intervention group received the conventional treatment combined with TCM bundle therapy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The secondary outcomes included the clinical indicators of sepsis. The 28-day mortality (35.3% vs. 48.3%, P = 0.01) and AGI-attributable mortality (15.1% vs. 36.2%, P = 0.02) in the intervention group were significantly lower than in controls.

We compared three approaches (drinking water attributable risk, quantitative microbial risk assessment, and population intervention model) to estimate the annual number of emergency department visits for AGI attributable to microorganisms in North Carolina community water systems. All three methods used 2007-2013 water monitoring and emergency department data obtained from state agencies. The drinking water attributable risk method, which was the basis for previous U.S. Environmental Protection Agency national risk assessments, estimated that 7.9% of annual emergency department visits for AGI are attributable to microbial contamination of community water systems. However, the other methods' estimates were more than 2 orders of magnitude lower, each attributing 0.047% of annual emergency department visits for AGI to community water system contamination. The differences in results between the drinking water attributable risk method, which has been the main basis for previous national risk estimates, and the other two approaches highlight the need to improve methods for estimating endemic waterborne disease risks, in order to prioritize investments to improve community drinking water systems."

The percentages of different treatments and agents were calculated from the patients' 1st prescriptions. Subgroup analyses were conducted for primary, secondary, and tertiary hospital settings.The initial treatments given to 57.7%, 30.7%, and 11.7% of patients were oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) monotherapy, OHA polytherapy, and insulin, respectively. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) (43.0%) were the most commonly used agents for monotherapy, followed by metformin (35.5%) and sulfonylureas (14.9%). AGIs were most commonly used in primary hospitals (52.0%), while metformin was prescribed most often in secondary (37.6%) and tertiary (41.8%) hospitals. From 2011 to 2015, there were increases in the use of AGIs (40.1-41.1%, P < .001) and metformin (34.0-40.4%, P < .001), but a decrease in the use of sulfonylureas (18.1-12.8%, P < .001). Similar trends were seen in the different hospital settings. Metformin plus an AGI, a sulfonylurea plus an AGI, and metformin plus a sulfonylurea were the most common OHA polytherapy combinations.

Epub 2019 Jun 7.,Post ICJH,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,2019,2019/06/11,,,10.1016/j.ejvs.2019.03.013,"OBJECTIVE: Aortic graft infection (AGI) is a disastrous complication with an incidence of 0.2-6% in operated patients. With little or no high quality evidence, the best treatment option remains unclear. Therefore, the literature on the management of open abdominal AGI was systematically reviewed to determine optimal treatment.
METHODS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for AGI. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Methodological quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-randomised Studies (MINORS) score. Primary outcomes were 30 day mortality and one year survival. Secondary outcomes were survival, infection recurrence, limb salvage, and graft patency.
RESULTS: Of 1574 studies identified, 32 papers were included in the study. The overall quality of the studies was moderate, with an average MINORS score of 11.9. Pooled overall 30 day mortality and one year survival were 13.5% (95% CI 10.5-16.4) and 73.6% (95% CI 68.8-78.4), respectively. The lowest 30 day mortality and highest one year survival were found for in situ repair compared with extra-anatomic repair and for prosthetic grafts compared with venous grafts or arterial allografts. The infection recurrence rate was highest for prosthetic grafts.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of well designed, qualitative comparative studies making conclusive recommendations impossible. The current best available data suggests that partial graft removal should be avoided and the lowest 30 day mortality and best one year survival are achieved with in situ repair using prosthetic grafts. Initiatives such as the MAGIC database to collaboratively collect prospective data are an important step forward in obtaining more solid answers on this topic."

A secondary goal was to analyze the relationship between AGI<sub>max</sub> and vasopressor dosage with increasing caloric intake.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective multicenter cohort study in ten ICUs across Argentina. Consecutive adult patients on MV, requiring vasopressors and receiving enteral nutrition (EN) were included. AGI<sub>max</sub> was identified (I-IV) using a modified AGI score. Comparisons of clinical and outcome variables were performed in 3 predetermined EN-groups: &lt;10 kcal/kg/d, ≥10 to &lt;20 kcal/kg/d, or ≥ 20 kcal/kg/d.
RESULTS: A total of 494 patients met all inclusion criteria. Forty-four percent of patients had severe AGI<sub>max</sub> and 17% received &lt;10 kcal/kg/day, indicating more severity and higher mortality. Notable independent predictors of mortality were AGI<sub>max</sub>, vasopressors, and caloric intake. PN was the only factor which had an inverse relationship to mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population, patients with AGI<sub>max</sub> III-IV were significantly associated with lower caloric intake and greater hospital mortality, highlighting the importance of AGI as a prognostic tool. As PN was linked with lower mortality, it could be an option to explore in further studies."

Epub 2016 May 10.,Li H,J Crit Care,2016,2016/08/23,,,10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.05.001,"PURPOSE: This prospective study investigated the association between disease severity and acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grade and between prognosis and AGI.
METHODS: In 12 teaching hospitals in China, patients in intensive care units who had received a diagnosis of AGI were enrolled (N = 196). Their demographics, body mass index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score, mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury, intensive care unit stay, and 7-day and 28-day mortality were recorded.
RESULTS: Of the 196 AGI patients, 90, 64, 29, and 13 were classified as grades I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores independently predicted grades III and IV; acute kidney injury independently predicted grade III. The 28-day mortality rates of grades I and II were similar, as were those of grades III and IV. The mortality rate of patients with grades I + II (gastrointestinal dysfunction) was significantly lower than that of patients with grades III + IV (gastrointestinal failure).
CONCLUSION: Differentiating AGI as gastrointestinal dysfunction or gastrointestinal failure appears to be more valid for predicting prognosis than the AGI 4-grade system."

The aim of this study was to compare these surgical strategies in a nationwide multicentre retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: The Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) was used to identify surgically treated abdominal AGIs in Sweden between January 1995 and May 2017. The primary aim was to compare short and long term survival, as well as complications for EAB and ISR.
RESULTS: Some 126 radically surgically treated AGI patients were identified - 102 graft infections and 24 endograft infections - treated by EAB: 71 and ISR: 55 (23 neo-aorto-iliac systems, NAISs). No differences in early 30 day (EAB 81.7% vs. ISR 76.4%, p = .46), or long term five year survival (48.2% vs. 49.9%, p = .87) were identified. There was no survival difference comparing NAIS to other ISR strategies. The frequency of recurrent graft infection during follow up was similar: EAB 20.3% vs. ISR 17.0% (p = .56). Survival and re-infection rates of the new conduit did not differ between NAIS and other ISR strategies. Age ≥ 75 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, confidence interval [CI] 1.1 - 14.8), coronary artery disease (OR 4.2, CI 1.2 - 15.1) and post-operative circulatory complications (OR 5.2, CI 1.2 - 22.5) were associated with early death. Prolonged antimicrobial therapy (> 3 months) was associated with reduced long term mortality (HR 0.3, CI 0.1 - 0.9).
CONCLUSION: In this nationwide multicentre study comparing outcomes of radically treated AGI, no differences in survival or re-infection rate could be identified comparing EAB and ISR."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the current AGI grading system and to investigate the association between AGI severity grades with clinical outcome in critically ill patients.
METHODS: Adult patients at 14 general intensive care units (ICUs) with an expected ICU stay ≥24 h were prospectively studied. The AGI grade was assessed daily on the basis of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, intra-abdominal pressures, and feeding intolerance (FI) in the first week of admission to the ICU.
RESULTS: Among the 550 patients enrolled, 456 patients (82.9%) received mechanical ventilation, and 470 patients were identified for AGI. The distribution of the global AGI grade was 24.5% with grade I, 49.4% with grade II, 20.6% with grade III, and 5.5% with grade IV. AGI grading was positively correlated with 28- and 60-day mortality (P &lt; 0.0001). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that age, sepsis, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, the use of vasoactive drugs, serum creatinine and lactate levels, mechanical ventilation, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and the global AGI grade were significantly (P ≤ 0.02) associated with 60-day mortality. In a multivariate analysis including these variables, diabetes mellitus (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03-1.87; P = 0.05), the use of vasoactive drugs (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.11; P = 0.01), serum lactate (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.24; P = 0.03), global AGI grade (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.28-2.12; P = 0.008), and APACHE II score (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06; P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with 60-day mortality. In a subgroup analysis of 402 patients with 7-day survival, in addition to clinical predictors and the AGI grade on the first day of ICU stay, FI within the first week of ICU stay had an independent and incremental prognostic value for 60-day mortality (χ2 = 41.9 vs. 52.2, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: The AGI grading scheme is useful for identifying the severity of GI dysfunction and could be used as a predictor of impaired outcomes. In addition, these results support the hypothesis that persistent FI within the first week of ICU stay is an independent determinant for mortality.

The acute GI injury (AGI) grading system, established in 2012, is extensively utilized to evaluate GI dysfunction and forecast outcomes in clinical settings. In 2021, the GI dysfunction score (GIDS) was developed, building on the AGI grading system, to enhance the accuracy of GI dysfunction severity assessment, improve prognostic predictions, reduce subjectivity, and increase reproducibility.
AIM: To compare the predictive capabilities of GIDS and the AGI grading system for 28-day mortality in critically ill patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at the general intensive care unit (ICU) of a regional university hospital. All data were collected during the first week of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed whether GIDS and AGI grade were independent risk factors for 28-day mortality. The predictive abilities of GIDS and AGI grade were compared using the receiver operating characteristic curve, with DeLong's test assessing differences between the curves' areas.
RESULTS: The incidence of AGI in the first week of ICU admission was 92.13%. There were 85 deaths (47.75%) within 28 days of ICU admission. There was no initial 24-hour difference in GIDS between the non-survival and survival groups. Both GIDS (OR 2.01, 95%CI: 1.25-3.24; P = 0.004) and AGI grade (OR 1.94, 95%CI: 1.12-3.38; P = 0.019) were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. No significant difference was found between the predictive accuracy of GIDS and AGI grade for 28-day mortality during the first week of ICU admission (Z = -0.26, P = 0.794).
CONCLUSION: GIDS within the first 24 hours was an unreliable predictor of 28-day mortality. The predictive accuracy for 28-day mortality from both systems during the first week was comparable."

However, the optimal second-line oral anti-diabetic agent (ADA) remains unclear. We investigated the cardiovascular risk of various ADAs used as add-on medication to metformin in T2DM patients from a nationwide cohort.
METHODS: T2DM patients using different add-on oral ADAs after an initial metformin therapy of > 90 days were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. Five classes of ADAs, including sulphonylureas (SU), glinides, thiazolidinediones (TZD), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4I) were selected for analysis. The reference group was the SU added to metformin. Patients were excluded if aged < 20 years, had a history of stroke or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or were receiving insulin treatment. The primary outcomes included any major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) including ACS, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, and death. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for MACE.
RESULTS: A total of 26,742 patients receiving their add-on drug to metformin of either SU (n = 24,277), glinides (n = 962), TZD (n = 581), AGI (n = 808), or DPP-4I (n = 114) were analyzed. After a mean follow-up duration of 6.6 ± 3.4 years, a total of 4775 MACEs occurred.

This study assesses SSIs after DLI closure and the temporal trends in skin closure technique.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for adult patients who underwent a DLI closure between 2012 and 2021 across a multistate health system. Skin closure technique was categorized as primary, primary ​+ ​drain, or purse-string closure. The primary outcome was SSI at the former DLI site.
RESULTS: A SSI was diagnosed in 5.7% of patients; 6.9% for primary closure, 5.7% for primary closure ​+ ​drain, and 2.7% for purse-string closure (p ​= ​0.25). A diagnosis of Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, and increasing operative time were significant risk factors for SSIs. There was a positive trend in the use of purse-string closure over time (p ​< ​0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a low SSI rate after DLI closure which did not vary significantly based on skin closure technique. Utilization of purse-string closure increased over time."

Most authorities agree that TR is mandatory for intracavitary AGI in patients with favorable conditions but there is an increasing number of patients with severe comorbidities for whom this approach is not suitable, resulting in a prohibitive mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to determine the most appropriate indication for TR or PR.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A meta-analysis was conducted on the rates of early/late mortality, amputations and reinfection. A meta-regression was performed with eight variables: patient age, male prevalence, presence of virulent or nonvirulent organisms, urgency, omentoplasty and follow-up.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies and 1052 patients were included. For TR and PR, the rates of early mortality and reinfection were 16.8% and 10.5%, 11% and 27%, respectively. For TR urgency and male gender were associated with increased rate of early mortality and male gender, PDF and virulent organisms were associated with increased risk of reinfection. For PR no statistical correlation was analyzable except for PDF with increased risk of reinfection.
CONCLUSIONS: Early mortality rates are higher for TR and reinfection rates are higher for PR. For TR early mortality increases in urgent cases and it is suggested that alternative option must be discussed, reinfection decreases in the presence of nonvirulent organisms and TR seems optimal. For TR and PR reinfection increases in presence of PDF and alternative technique may be more appropriate."

This study was a secondary analysis of a multicenter, prospective, observational study that enrolled adult patients with an expected duration of mechanical ventilation ≥ 48 h from 14 general intensive care units in Zhejiang Province between March and August 2014. The AGI grade was assessed daily on the basis of gastrointestinal symptoms, intra-abdominal pressures, and feeding intolerance in the first week of admission to the ICU. This study included 331 patients (69.2% men; mean age, 64.6 ± 18.9 years). Multivariate regression analysis showed that plateau pressure (Pplat) (OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.009-1.081, P = 0.013), serum creatinine (OR 1.003, 95% CI 1.001-1.006, P = 0.042) and APACHE II score (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.021-1.072, P = 0.045) were independently associated with global AGI grade III/IV within 7 days of ICU admission.

The aim of this study was to explore whether serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP), which is excreted specifically from damaged intestinal enterocytes, as a predictor of prognosis in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.From January 2017 to December 2017, 40 postoperative cardiac surgery patients were enrolled in this observational study. Serum IFABP levels and prognostic biomarkers were recorded at intensive care unit (ICU) admission.The serum IFABP levels were significantly higher in postoperative cardiac surgery patients who complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (median, 883.20 pg/mL vs 426.10 pg/mL; P < .001), infective complications (median, 917.70 pg/mL vs 409.40 pg/mL; P < .001), or who stayed in ICU beyond 4 days (median, 807.65 pg/mL vs 426.10 pg/mL; P < .001). Moreover, in patients who suffered from right ventricular dysfunction, the serum IFABP levels were significantly higher (median, 737.85 pg/mL vs 445.55 pg/mL; P = .016). The serum IFABP levels also showed great precision for the prediction of MODS (the area under curve, AUC 0.923), infective complications (AUC 0.961) and ICU stay beyond 4 days (AUC 0.853). And it correlated significantly with the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score (P < .05), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (P < .05), and acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grade (P < .001).The serum IFABP level at ICU admission is a valuable, convenient, and objective early predictor of prognosis in postoperative cardiac surgery patients."

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of AGI in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG), moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. The date of the last search of all databases was December 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with a duration of one year or more, comparing AGI with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with IFG, IGT, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles or records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data, which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with assessment of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.
MAIN RESULTS: For this update of the Cochrane Review (first published 2006, Issue 4) we included 10 RCTs (11,814 participants), eight investigating acarbose and two investigating voglibose, that included people with IGT or people ""at increased risk for diabetes"". The trial duration ranged from one to six years. Most trials compared AGI with placebo (N = 4) or no intervention (N = 4).Acarbose reduced the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo: 670 out of 4014 people (16.7%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 812 out of 3994 people (20.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89; P < 0.0001; 3 trials; 8008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial including participants with coronary heart disease and IGT contributed 64% of cases for this outcome. Acarbose reduced the risk of T2DM compared to no intervention: 7 out 75 people (9.3%) in the acarbose groups developed T2DM, compared to 18 out of 65 people (27.7%) in the no-intervention groups (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; P = 0.004; 2 trials; 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence).Acarbose compared to placebo did not reduce or increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; P = 0.86; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.10; P = 0.26; 3 trials; 8069 participants; very low-certainty evidence), serious adverse events (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.29; P = 0.13; 2 trials; 6625 participants; low-certainty evidence), non-fatal stroke (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.74; P = 0.43; 1 trial; 1368 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or congestive heart failure (RR of 0.87; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.12; P = 0.40; 2 trials; 7890 participants; low-certainty evidence). Acarbose compared to placebo reduced non-fatal myocardial infarction: one out of 742 participants (0.1%) in the acarbose groups had a non-fatal myocardial infarction compared to 15 out of 744 participants (2%) in the placebo groups (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53; P = 0.007; 2 trials; 1486 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Acarbose treatment showed an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (mainly gastro-intestinal events), compared to placebo: 751 of 775 people (96.9%) in the acarbose groups experienced an event, compared to 723 of 775 people (93.3%) in the placebo groups (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06; P = 0.0008; 2 trials; 1550 participants). Acarbose compared to no intervention showed no advantage or disadvantage for any of these outcome measures (very low-certainty evidence).One trial each compared voglibose with placebo (1780 participants) or diet and exercise (870 participants). Voglibose compared to placebo reduced the incidence of T2DM: 50 out of 897 participants (5.6%) developed T2DM, compared to 106 out of 881 participants (12%) in the placebo group (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64; P < 0.0001; 1 trial; 1778 participants; low-certainty evidence). For all other reported outcome measures there were no clear differences between voglibose and comparator groups. One trial with 90 participants compared acarbose with diet and exercise and another trial with 98 participants reported data on acarbose versus metformin. There were no clear differences for any outcome measure between these two acarbose interventions and the associated comparator groups.None of the trials reported amputation of lower extremity, blindness or severe vision loss, end-stage renal disease, health-related quality of life, time to progression to T2DM, or socioeconomic effects.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: AGI may prevent or delay the development of T2DM in people with IGT. There is no firm evidence that AGI have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Korean National Diabetes Program was a prospective, multicenter observational cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Korea. Of the 3,950 patients enrolled in the study, we studied 998 who were continuously maintained on monotherapy for at least 90 days at six participating centers. To balance the baseline characteristics of patients in each group, we used propensity matching at a 1:1 ratio (metformin vs sulfonylureas) and 4:1 ratio (metformin vs meglitinides and metformin vs alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [aGIs]). The hazard ratios (HRs) of treatments (compared with metformin) were determined by Cox's proportional hazards regression modeling.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 56 months, and monotherapy failed in 45% of all patients. The annual incidences of failure were 15.6%, 21.3%, 27% and 9.6% in the metformin, sulfonylurea, meglitinide and aGI groups. Compared with metformin, sulfonylureas and meglitinides were associated with higher risks of monotherapy failure (HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.80; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.13-3.27), and aGIs with risks similar to that of metformin (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.44-1.45). When analyzed by failure type, sulfonylureas, meglitinides and aGIs were associated with a higher risk of a switch to other agents (HR 4.43, 95% CI 2.14-9.17; HR 18.80, 95% CI 6.21-56.93; HR 4.25, 95% CI 1.49-12.13), and aGIs with a lower risk of prescription of add-on second agents (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was associated with a lower failure risk than were sulfonylureas and meglitinides, but a comparable aGI failure rate."

Sporadic cases continue to occur in different locations. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a high risk of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Successful control of blood glucose levels can effectively decrease the risks of severe infections and mortality. However, the effects of different treatments were reported differently and even adversely. This retrospective study included 4,922 patients who have been diagnosed as COVID-19 and T2DM from 138 Hubei hospitals. The clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared and calculated their risk for death using multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves. After adjustment of age, sex, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (AGI) use performed lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.71; p = 0.001 for metformin; 0.53, 0.35-0.80, p = 0.002 for AGIs), while insulin use was associated with increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 2.07, 95% CI, 1.61-2.67, p < 0.001). After propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis, adjusted HRs for insulin, metformin, and AGIs associated with all-cause mortality were 1.32 (95% CI, 1.03-1.81; p = 0.012), 0.48 (95% CI, 0.23-0.83, p = 0.014), and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.35-0.98, p = 0.05). Therefore, metformin and AGIs might be more suitable for patients with COVID-19 and T2DM while insulin might be used with caution."

METHODS: Patient data collected included pituitary hormone deficiencies, sleep studies, echocardiograms, gallbladder sonographies, colonoscopies, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone levels in patients with (DM) and without (non-DM) diabetes mellitus were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 241 patients enrolled. Pituitary hormone deficiencies were reported more frequently at enrollment in male (56.9%) vs female patients (32.0%; p < 0.001). TSH deficiency was the most common endocrine deficiency (69.8%), followed by gonadotropin deficiency (62.3%). Screening tests reported at enrollment: sleep studies in 29.9% (79.2% had sleep apnea), echocardiogram in 46.1% (46.8% abnormal), gallbladder sonography in 18.7% (17.8% had gallstones), and colonoscopy in 48.1% (35.3% had polyps). Follow-up studies were reported less frequently at 1 and 2 years. HbA1c data were reported in 30.8% and 41.2% after 1 and 2 years. HbA1c levels were similar at 1 and 2 years of LAN therapy among DM and non-DM patients with available data. Fewer DM vs non-DM patients achieved IGF-1 below upper limit of normal at Month 24 (58.3% vs 80.6%; p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: Fewer than half of patients in SODA had screening results reported at enrollment for sleep apnea, cardiomyopathy, and colon polyps. Gallbladder imaging was reported in a minority of patients. Lower IGF-1 control rates were observed in DM vs non-DM patients at Month 24. These data suggest a need for better monitoring of comorbidities in US acromegaly patients."

Epub 2024 Jul 15.,Girshfeld SJ,Ann Vasc Surg,2024,2024/07/17,,,10.1016/j.avsg.2024.05.033,"OBJECTIVES: Aortic graft infection (AGI) is a life-threatening complication that can result in death, amputation, sepsis, aorto-enteric fistula, and pseudoaneurysm formation. After explantation of the infected graft, options for reconstruction include extra-anatomic bypass or in-line reconstruction using antibiotic-coated prosthetic graft, cryopreserved allograft, or a neo-aortoiliac system (NAIS) using autogenous femoral veins. While the NAIS procedure has shown promising results, there is relatively limited clinical experience due the magnitude and morbidity of the surgery. In this study, we reviewed our single-center experience using the NAIS procedure and performed a systematic review of the contemporary literature more than the past decade.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all patients undergoing NAIS reconstruction with autogenous femoral vein conduits at a single institution from 2010 to 2022. Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were queried for studies published from 2012 to 2022 to identify those reporting on outcomes of patients undergoing the NAIS procedure. Outcome variables included early and late mortality, major complications including amputation, graft or conduit related complications, re-infection, and re-intervention. Additional variables collected include patient demographics, operative technique, and follow up.
RESULTS: There were 14 patients included in our case series with 30-day mortality of 21%. At a mean follow up of 22 months, complication rate was 64.3%, re-intervention rate was 14.3%, re-infection rate was 7.1%, and amputation rate was 7.1%. On review of the literature, 12 studies ultimately met criteria to be included in analysis with a combined total of 368 patients. Pooled averages included 30-day mortality of 9.0%, re-intervention rate of 20.5%, re-infection rate of 5.6%, and amputation rate of 6.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The NAIS procedure for management of AGI is a formidable procedure with significant early mortality and morbidity. This treatment should be considered in the context of other revascularization options for management of an AGI."

Data on the prevalence of NEA versus eosinophilic asthma (EA) in mild-to-moderate asthma are limited.
OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of the prevalence of mild-to-moderate asthma in adolescents and adults using sputum inflammatory cell analysis and their responses to ICS.
METHODS: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane) for studies in adolescents and adults with mild-to-moderate asthma. The primary outcome was the prevalence of asthma subtypes based on sputum inflammatory cell analysis, categorized into EA and NEA. The secondary outcome involved comparing asthma outcomes between different subtypes after ICS therapy. Certainty of evidence was reported for each pooled analysis.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 3,533 adolescents and adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were reviewed. The pooled prevalence (95% confidence interval) of NEA was estimated at 40.39% (27.54, 53.93) in patients with ICS naive with very low certainty of evidence. On reevaluating sputum cytology, the disease of approximately 20% to 30% of patients initially diagnosed as NEA transitioned to the EA subtype. EA patients showed significant improvements in asthma symptoms after ICS therapy: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (standardized mean difference, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.30, 1.27), and airway hyperresponsiveness (standardized mean difference, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.29, 2.40). NEA patients exhibited limited response.
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of adolescents and adults with mild-to-moderate asthma were identified with NEA subtype disease, which exhibited a poor response to ICS. A thorough diagnostic evaluation before initiating treatment should be integrated into clinical practice.Registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023484334)."

Their occurrence is probably underestimated due to the lack of a specific surveillance system. The French health insurance database provides an interesting opportunity to improve the detection of these events. A specific algorithm to identify AGI cases from drug payment reimbursement data in the health insurance database has been previously developed. The purpose of our comparative study was to retrospectively assess the ability of the health insurance data to describe WBDO. Data from the health insurance database was compared with the data from cohort studies conducted in two WBDO in 2010 and 2012. The temporal distribution of cases, the day of the peak and the duration of the epidemic, as measured using the health insurance data, were similar to the data from one of the two cohort studies. However, health insurance data accounted for 54 cases compared to the estimated 252 cases accounted for in the cohort study. The accuracy of using health insurance data to describe WBDO depends on the medical consultation rate in the impacted population. As this is never the case, data analysis underestimates the total number of AGI cases. However this data source can be considered for the development of a detection system of a WBDO in France, given its ability to describe an epidemic signal."

METHODS: Prospectively maintained institutional database was queried for all AWR between 2012 and 2019. AS and NS were included. Primary outcomes were wound and respiratory complications; secondary outcome was recurrence. Standard statistical analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Evaluation included 1088 patients, 305 AS and 783 NS. AS had a lower BMI (31.3 vs 32.7 ​kg/m2; P ​= ​0.004) but increased ASA Class III (51.5% vs 34.5 ​%, P ​= ​0.009), COPD (8.9% vs 4.0 ​%, P ​= ​0.001), comorbidities (6.3 vs 4.7, P &lt; 0.001), and wound class (Class III/IV: 25.3% vs 15.8 ​%, P ​= ​0.003).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We previously randomized men with mCRPC to enzalutamide or AAP to compare side-effects and measured androgen concentrations. In this post-hoc analysis, patients were grouped in quartiles (Q) based on their serum androgen values. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used to analyze progression-free and overall survival for baseline androgen groups, treatment subgroups and their interaction. The trial was registered at clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2017-000099-27).
RESULTS: Eighty-four patients received enzalutamide and 85 AAP. Overall, higher (Q4) compared with lower (Q1) baseline serum testosterone was associated with longer progression-free survival (24.8 vs. 10.7 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33; 0.84) and overall survival (52.8 vs. 31.5 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28; 0.85). The risk reduction in death seemed to be treatment dependent (treatment subgroup interaction P = .04). For men in the AAP subgroup, the Q4 compared with Q1 group had a significant lower risk of death (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13; 0.73), while no difference was found for enzalutamide (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.35; 1.69). Similar results were found for the other androgens.
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment serum testosterone levels may be a clinically useful biomarker for predicting mCRPC treatment responses and guiding treatment selection."

These graphs, i.e. biological knowledge graphs, are then processed using graph exploratory approaches to perform different types of analytical and predictive tasks. Despite the high predictive accuracy of these approaches, they have limited scalability due to their dependency on time-consuming path exploratory procedures. In recent years, owing to the rapid advances of computational technologies, new approaches for modelling graphs and mining them with high accuracy and scalability have emerged. These approaches, i.e. knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, operate by learning low-rank vector representations of graph nodes and edges that preserve the graph's inherent structure. These approaches were used to analyse knowledge graphs from different domains where they showed superior performance and accuracy compared to previous graph exploratory approaches. In this work, we study this class of models in the context of biological knowledge graphs and their different applications. We then show how KGE models can be a natural fit for representing complex biological knowledge modelled as graphs. We also discuss their predictive and analytical capabilities in different biology applications. In this regard, we present two example case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of KGE models: prediction of drug-target interactions and polypharmacy side effects. Finally, we analyse different practical considerations for KGEs, and we discuss possible opportunities and challenges related to adopting them for modelling biological systems."

However, the current approach to gene expression reversal has several limitations. First, most methods focus on validating the reversal expression of individual genes. Second, there is a lack of causal approaches for identifying drug repurposing candidates. Third, few methods for passing and summarizing information on a graph have been used for drug repurposing analysis, with classical network propagation and gene set enrichment analysis being the most common. Fourth, there is a lack of graph-valued association analysis, with current approaches using real-valued association analysis one gene at a time to reverse abnormal gene expressions to normal gene expressions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel causal inference and graph neural network (GNN)-based framework for identifying drug repurposing candidates. We formulated a causal network as a continuous constrained optimization problem and developed a new algorithm for reconstructing large-scale causal networks of up to 1,000 nodes. We conducted large-scale simulations that demonstrated good false positive and false negative rates. To aggregate and summarize information on both nodes and structure from the spatial domain of the causal network, we used directed acyclic graph neural networks (DAGNN). We also developed a new method for graph regression in which both dependent and independent variables are graphs. We used graph regression to measure the degree to which drugs reverse altered gene expressions of disease to normal levels and to select potential drug repurposing candidates. To illustrate the application of our proposed methods for drug repurposing, we applied them to phase I and II L1000 connectivity map perturbational profiles from the Broad Institute LINCS, which consist of gene-expression profiles for thousands of perturbagens at a variety of time points, doses, and cell lines, as well as disease gene expression data under-expressed and over-expressed in response to SARS-CoV-2."

While recent advancements in ADRD risk prediction have primarily relied on imaging analysis, not all patients undergo medical imaging before an ADRD diagnosis. Merging machine learning with claims data can reveal additional risk factors and uncover interconnections among diverse medical codes.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to use graph neural networks (GNNs) with claim data for ADRD risk prediction. Addressing the lack of human-interpretable reasons behind these predictions, we introduce an innovative, self-explainable method to evaluate relationship importance and its influence on ADRD risk prediction.
METHODS: We used a variationally regularized encoder-decoder GNN (variational GNN [VGNN]) integrated with our proposed relation importance method for estimating ADRD likelihood. This self-explainable method can provide a feature-important explanation in the context of ADRD risk prediction, leveraging relational information within a graph. Three scenarios with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year prediction windows were created to assess the model's efficiency, respectively. Random forest (RF) and light gradient boost machine (LGBM) were used as baselines. By using this method, we further clarify the key relationships for ADRD risk prediction.
RESULTS: In scenario 1, the VGNN model showed area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores of 0.7272 and 0.7480 for the small subset and the matched cohort data set. It outperforms RF and LGBM by 10.6% and 9.1%, respectively, on average. In scenario 2, it achieved AUROC scores of 0.7125 and 0.7281, surpassing the other models by 10.5% and 8.9%, respectively. Similarly, in scenario 3, AUROC scores of 0.7001 and 0.7187 were obtained, exceeding 10.1% and 8.5% than the baseline models, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate the significant superiority of the graph-based approach over the tree-based models (RF and LGBM) in predicting ADRD. Furthermore, the integration of the VGNN model and our relation importance interpretation could provide valuable insight into paired factors that may contribute to or delay ADRD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Using our innovative self-explainable method with claims data enhances ADRD risk prediction and provides insights into the impact of interconnected medical code relationships. This methodology not only enables ADRD risk modeling but also shows potential for other image analysis predictions using claims data."

The evidence base and features of ADR reports that are used to support signals remain to be comprehensively described. To this end, we have undertaken a scoping review.
METHODS: We searched the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, without language or time restrictions. We also hand searched the bibliographies of relevant studies. We included studies of any design if the results were described as signals. We assessed the levels of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) criteria and coded features of reports of ADRs using the Bradford Hill guidelines.
RESULTS: Overall, 1974 publications reported 2421 studies of signals; 1683/2421 were clinical assessments of anecdotal reports of ADRs, but only 225 (13%) of these included explicit judgments on which features of the ADR reports were supportive of a signal. These 225 studies yielded 228 signals; these were supported by features, which were: 'experimental evidence' (i.e., positive dechallenge or rechallenge, 154 instances [68%]), 'temporality' (i.e., time to onset, 130 [57%]), 'exclusion of competing causes' (49 [21%]), and others (40 [17%]). Positive dechallenge/rechallenge often co-occurred with temporality (77/228). OCEBM 4 (i.e., case series and case-control studies) was the most frequent level of evidence (2078 studies). Between 2013 and 2019, there was a three-fold increase in clinical assessments of reports of ADRs compared with a less than two-fold increase in studies supported by higher levels of evidence (i.e., OCEBM 1-3). We identified an increased rate between 2013 and 2019 in disproportionality analyses (about 15 studies per year), mostly from academia.
CONCLUSIONS: Most signals were supported by temporality and dechallenge/rechallenge, but clear reporting of judgments on causality remains infrequent. The number of studies supported only by anecdotal reports of ADRs increased from year to year. The impact of a growing number of signals of disproportionate reporting communicated without an accompanying clinical assessment should be evaluated."

Spatial-omics technologies can simultaneously measure information from three complementary domains related to this task: expression levels of a panel of molecular biomarkers at single-cell resolution, relative positions of cells, and images of tissue sections, but existing computational methods for performing this task on single-cell spatial-omics datasets often relinquish information from one or more domains. The additional reliance on the availability of ""atlas"" training or reference datasets limits cell type discovery to well-defined but limited cell population labels, thus posing major challenges for using these methods in practice. Successful integration of all three domains presents an opportunity for uncovering cell populations that are functionally stratified by their spatial contexts at cellular and tissue levels: the key motivation for employing spatial-omics technologies in the first place. In this work, we introduce Cell Spatio- and Neighborhood-informed Annotation and Patterning (CellSNAP), a self-supervised computational method that learns a representation vector for each cell in tissue samples measured by spatial-omics technologies at the single-cell or finer resolution. The learned representation vector fuses information about the corresponding cell across all three aforementioned domains. By applying CellSNAP to datasets spanning both spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we show that CellSNAP markedly enhances de novo discovery of biologically relevant cell populations at fine granularity, beyond current approaches, by fully integrating cells' molecular profiles with cellular neighborhood and tissue image information."

OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed at determining risk factors for long-term sleep impairment in very-preterm (VPT; <32 weeks of gestation) infants.
METHODS: Sleep problems were analyzed in an observational study in infants of the German Neonatal Network born between January 1st 2009 and December 31st 2014. Parental questionnaires of n = 2928 VPT children were evaluated regarding the child's sleep behavior at five years of age. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for delayed sleep onset and hyperactivity/inattention (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire). In a second cohort of n = 342 VPT infants, sleep habits were evaluated at toddlers age via the Infant Sleep Questionnaire.
RESULTS: In our cohorts, 424/2928 (14.5 %) preterm children were diagnosed with delayed sleep onset at early school age while 57/342 (16.7 %) had sleep impairment in early infancy. Gestational age was not independently associated with sleep problems (i.e., early school age: OR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.9-1.1, p = 0.15). Notably, in both our cohorts, neonatal exposure to analgesics and sedatives was associated with a higher risk for sleep problems, i.e., early school age: exposure to sedatives: OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.02-1.7, p = 0.03. Sleep problems and drug exposure were both associated with hyperactivity/inattention.
CONCLUSION: Sleep problems of VPT children are unrelated to gestational age which suggests rather individual risk factors. The significant neonatal exposure to analgesics and sedatives may contribute to long-term sleep impairment."

BACKGROUND: TIN presents in various malignant tumors, but its clinical significance in gastric cancer remains obscure.
METHODS: The study enrolled 3 independent sets of patients with gastric cancer from 2 institutional medical centers of China. TIN was estimated by immunohistochemical staining of CD66b, and its relationship with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Prognostic accuracies were evaluated by C-index and Akaike information criterion.
RESULTS: TINs in gastric cancer tissues ranged from 0 to 192 cells/high magnification filed (HPF), 0 to 117 cells/HPF, and 0 to 142 cells/HPF in the training, testing, and validation sets, respectively. TINs were negatively correlated with lymph node classification (P = 0.007, P = 0.041, and P = 0.032, respectively) and tumor stage (P = 0.019, P = 0.013, and P = 0.025, respectively) in the 3 sets. Moreover, multivariate analysis identified TINs and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage as 2 independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Incorporation of TINs into well-established TNM system generated a predictive model that shows better predictive accuracy for overall survival. More importantly, patients with higher TINs were prone to overall survival benefit from postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. These results were validated in the independent testing and validation sets.
CONCLUSIONS: TIN in gastric cancer was identified as an independent prognostic factor, which could be incorporated into standard TNM staging system to refine risk stratification and predict for overall survival benefit from postoperative chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer."

Headlines on national television channels and in newspapers had important consequences for the involved institutions and a negative impact on the relationship between families and staff in many German NICUs. OBJECTIVE To determine whether NICU outbreaks reported in the media influenced provider behavior in the community of neonatal care and led to more third-line antibiotic prescribing. DESIGN Observational cohort study. METHODS To investigate secular trends, we evaluated data for very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs, birth weight <1,500 g) enrolled in the German Neonatal Network (GNN) between 2009 and 2014 (N=10,253). For outbreak effects, we specifically analyzed data for VLBWIs discharged 6 months before (n=2,428) and 6 months after outbreaks (n=2,508). RESULTS The exposure of all VLBWIs to third-line antibiotics increased after outbreaks (19.4% before vs 22.5% after; P=.007). This trend particularly affected male infants (4.6% increase; P=.005) and infants with a birth weight between 1,000 and 1,499 g (3.5% increase; P=.001) In a logistic regression analysis, month of discharge as linear variable of time was associated with increased exposure to third-line antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.009-1.014; P<.001), and discharge within the 6-month period after outbreak reports independently contributed to this long-term trend (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.017-1.270; P=.024). CONCLUSIONS Media reports directly affect medical practice, eg, overuse of third-line antibiotics. Future communication and management strategies must be based on objective dialogues between the scientific community and investigative journalists. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;37:924-930."

METHODS: Patients included for salivary duct carcinoma between 2009 and 2016 in the Réseau d'Expertise Français des Cancers ORL Rares (REFCOR) database were selected. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included in this study. The primary site was the parotid gland in 90% of the cases. Fifty-seven percent of the tumors were stage IV, 65% of patients had lymph node involvement, and 10% had metastases. Tumors showed androgen receptor (89%) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu (36%). Ninety-four percent of patients underwent surgery and 86% had postoperative radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with targeted therapies. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 74% and the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 44%. Tumor stages III to IV reduced DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.3; P = .04). The N2/3 class reduced distant metastasis-free survival (HR 7.3; P = .007).
CONCLUSION: Salivary duct carcinoma prognosis is poor and is correlated with tumor stage and lymph node classification. Androgen receptor and HER2/neu should be tested as they offer the possibility of targeted therapies."

Epub 2016 Sep 21.,Muneoka Y,Int J Surg,2016,2016/11/08,,,10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.09.080,"BACKGROUND: Prognoses vary substantially among patients with advanced gastric cancer following curative surgery. The aim of the current study was to develop and verify the validity of a novel nomogram that predicts the probability of 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients who underwent curative resection for stage II/III gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A nomogram to predict 5-year RFS following surgical resection of gastric cancer was constructed based on the data of patients who underwent surgery for primary gastric carcinoma at three institutions in Japan in January 2001-December 2006. Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed, and the nomogram's predictive accuracy (discrimination) and the agreement between observed outcomes and predictions (calibration) were evaluated by internal validation.
RESULTS: Multivariate analyses revealed that age at operation, depth of tumor, tumor location, lymph node classification, and presence of combined resection were significant prognostic factors for RFS. In the internal validation, discrimination of the developed nomogram for 5-year RFS was superior to that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification (concordance indices of 0.80 versus 0.67; P < 0.001). Moreover, calibration appeared to be accurate. Based on these results, we have created free software to more easily predict 5-year RFS.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a nomogram to predict 5-year RFS after curative surgery for stage II/III gastric cancer. This tool will be useful for the assessing a patient's individual recurrence risk when considering additional therapy in clinical practice."

Epub 2021 Oct 8.,Humberg A,Stroke,2022,2021/10/08,,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.033432,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Associations of APOE genotypes with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in preterm infants were previously described. In adults, APOE-ε4 genotype has been proposed as susceptibility factor for impaired recovery after cerebral insult. We here aim to determine APOE genotype-specific neurological consequences of neonatal ICH at school age.
METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, very low birth weight (<1500 g, <32 weeks gestational age) children were studied for cerebral palsy (CP) after ultrasound diagnosed ICH stratified by APOE genotype. Follow-up examination was done at the age of 5 to 6 years. Study personnel were blinded for perinatal information and complications. Participants were born between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013 and enrolled in the German Neonatal Network. Of 8022 infants primarily enrolled, 2467 children were invited for follow-up between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact of APOE genotype (APOE-ε2, APOE-ε3, APOE-ε4) on CP after ICH.
RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred fifteen children participated at follow-up, including 363 children with ultrasound diagnosed neonatal ICH. In univariate analyses of children with a history of ICH, APOE-ε3 carriers had lower frequencies of CP (n=33/250; 13.2 [95% CI, 9.4%-17.8%]), as compared to APOE-ε2 (n=15/63; 23.8 [14.6%-35.3%], P=0.037) and -ε4 carriers (n=31/107; 29.0 [21.0%-38.0%], P&lt;0.001), respectively. Regression models revealed an association of APOE-ε4 genotype and CP development (odds ratio, 2.77 [1.44-5.32], P=0.002) after ICH. Notably, at low-grade ICH (grade I) APOE-ε4 expression resulted in an increased rate of CP (n=6/39; 15.4 [6.7-29.0]) in comparison to APOE-ε3 (n=2/105; 1.9 [0.4%-6.0%], P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: APOE-ε4 carriers have an increased risk for long-term motor deficits after ICH. We assume an effect even after low-grade neonatal ICH, but more data are needed to clarify this issue."

Characterization of these patients may inform post-hospitalization care.
OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who returned to the emergency department (ED) or required readmission within 14 days of discharge.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SARS-COV-2-positive patients with index hospitalization between February 27 and April 12, 2020, with ≥ 14-day follow-up. Significance was defined as P < 0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons.
PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 discharged alive from five New York City hospitals.
MAIN MEASURES: Readmission or return to ED following discharge.
RESULTS: Of 2864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared with patients who did not return, there were higher proportions of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%) among those who returned. Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; P<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; P<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, P<sub>adjusted</sub> = 0.06). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Return to hospital after admission for COVID-19 was infrequent within 14 days of discharge. The most common cause for return was respiratory distress. Patients who returned more likely had COPD and hypertension, shorter LOS on index-hospitalization, and lower rates of in-hospital treatment-dose anticoagulation. Future studies should focus on whether these comorbid conditions, longer LOS, and anticoagulation are associated with reduced readmissions."

It remains a matter of debate whether screening is worth the effort. We therefore aimed to evaluate sepsis related outcomes before and after the guideline update.
METHODS: The German Neonatal Network (GNN) is a prospective cohort study including data from extremely preterm infants between 22 + 0 and 28 + 6 gestational weeks born in 62 German level III NICUs.
RESULTS: Infants treated after guideline update (n = 8.903) had a lower mortality (12.5% vs. 13.8%, p = 0.036), reduced rates for clinical sepsis (31.4 vs. 42.8%, p <  0.001) and culture-proven sepsis (14.4% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.003) as compared to infants treated before update (n = 3.920). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, nine pathogens of culture-proven sepsis were associated with sepsis-related death, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa [OR 59 (19-180), p <  0.001)]. However, the guideline update had no significant effect on pathogen-specific case fatality, total sepsis-related mortality and culture-proven sepsis rates with MDRO. While the exposure of GNN infants to cefotaxime declined over time (31.1 vs. 40.1%, p <  0.001), the treatment rate with meropenem was increased (31.6 vs. 26.3%, p <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of weekly screening and extended hygiene measures is associated with reduced sepsis rates, but has no effects on sepsis-related mortality and sepsis with screening-relevant pathogens. The high exposure rate to meropenem should be a target of antibiotic stewardship programs."

We have analysed the results of our previously published scoping review to determine whether DME signals differ from those of other adverse events in terms of time to communication and characteristics of supporting reports of suspected adverse drug reactions.
METHODS: For all signals, we obtained the launch year of medicinal products from textbooks or regulatory agencies, extracted the year of the first report in VigiBase and calculated the interval between the first report and communication (time to communication, TTC). We further retrieved the average completeness (via vigiGrade) of the reports in each case series in the years before the communication. We categorised as DME signals those concerning an event in the EMA's list. We described the two groups of signals using medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and compared them using the Brunner-Munzel test, calculating 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and P values.
RESULTS: Of 4520 signals, 919 concerned DMEs and 3601 concerned non-DMEs. Signals of DMEs were supported by a median of 15 reports (IQR 6-38 reports) with a completeness score of 0.52 (IQR 0.43-0.62) and signals of non-DMEs by 20 reports (IQR 6-84 reports) with a completeness score of 0.46 (IQR 0.38-0.56). The probability that a random DME signal was supported by fewer reports than non-DME signals was 0.56 (95% CI 0.54-0.58, P < 0.001) and that of one having lower average completeness was 0.39 (95% CI 0.36-0.41, P < 0.001). The median TTCs of DME and non-DME signals did not differ (10 years), but the TTC was as low as 2 years when signals (irrespective of classification) were supported by reports whose average completeness was > 0.80.
CONCLUSIONS: Signals of designated medical events were supported by fewer reports and higher completeness scores than signals of other adverse events. Although statistically significant, the differences in effect sizes between the two groups were small. This suggests that listing certain adverse events as DMEs is not having the expected effect of encouraging a focus on reports of the types of suspected adverse reactions that deserve special attention. Further enhancing the completeness of the reports of suspected adverse drug reactions supporting signals of designated medical events might shorten their time to communication and reduce the number of reports required to support them."

Epub 2019 Jan 31.,Tham T,Laryngoscope,2019,2019/02/01,,,10.1002/lary.27818,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if delayed or prolonged treatment-related time intervals (TRTIs) was associated with survival in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) undergoing curative-intent concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT). The TRTIs investigated were duration of radiation treatment (RTd), time to radiation start (TTR), and time to chemotherapy start (TTC).
METHODS: Observational cohort study using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). In this observational cohort study, 3,893 eligible patients with NPC were identified from the NCDB. Patients received CCRT of at least 66 grays and radiation treatment time of at least 40 days. Separate univariable Cox regression model was used to analyze overall survival (OS) as a function of TRTIs, as well as for Charlson/Deyo Score, tumor classification, node classification, histological type, ethnicity, age, sex, and facility type. Upon finding significance at P < 0.05, the multivariable Cox regression analysis with backward elimination was performed to yield the final prediction model. Results were considered statistically significant when P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Radiation treatment was significantly associated with OS in the univariable analysis (hazard ratio: 1.006, 95% confidence interval = 1.004-1.008, P < 0.001). However, RTd was not related to OS in the multivariable analysis (P = 0.19). The TTR and TTC variables were not associated with OS in the univariable analysis (P = 0.88 and P = 0.88, respectively).
CONCLUSION: TRTIs were not independently associated with OS in this cohort of NPC patients in the NCDB. Future research into the association of TRTI with other disease outcomes, such as disease-free survival and locoregional control, is needed.

Epub 2015 Jul 21.,Faust K,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,2015,2015/07/23,,,10.1136/archdischild-2014-306483,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lowest mean arterial blood pressure during the first 24 h of life (minMAP(24)) in very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants and to identify associations between hypotension and short-term outcome.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of the minMAP(24) of 4907 VLBW infants with a gestational age <32 weeks in correlation with clinical data. Hypotension was defined as minMAP(24) being lower than the median value of all patients of the same gestational age.
RESULTS: MinMAP(24) values correlated with gestational age. Median minMAP(24) values of VLBW infants ≤29 weeks' gestation were 1-2 mm Hg lower than gestational age in completed weeks. Hypotensive infants had a higher rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH, 20.3% vs 15.9%, p<0.001), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, 19.2% vs 15.1%, p<0.001) and death (5.2% vs 3.0%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses, including potential confounders, confirmed these data. MinMAP(24) was an independent risk factor for IVH (OR 0.97/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, p=0.003), BPD (OR 0.96/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.98, p<0.001) and mortality (OR 0.94/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, p=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Hypotension during the first 24 h of life is associated with adverse outcomes in VLBW infants. This underlines the need for randomised controlled trials on the use of vasoactive drugs in this vulnerable patient cohort."

(2) Methods: We performed a 5-year-follow-up assessment including a strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and an intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI)-III test in preterm children previously enrolled in the German Neonatal Network (GNN). The analysis was restricted to children exposed to antenatal corticosteroids and postnatal antibiotics. (3) Results: 2467 primary school-aged children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In multivariable linear regression models breastfeeding ≥3 months was associated with lower conduct disorders (B (95% confidence intervals (CI)): -0.25 (-0.47 to -0.03)) and inattention/hyperactivity (-0.46 (-0.81 to -0.10)) as measured by SDQ. Probiotic treatment during the neonatal period had no effect on SDQ scores or intelligence. (4) Conclusions: Prolonged breastfeeding of highly vulnerable infants may promote their mental health later in childhood, particularly by reducing risk for inattention/hyperactivity and conduct disorders. Future studies need to disentangle the underlying mechanisms during a critical time frame of development."

However, it is unclear at what gestational age the benefits of spontaneous delivery outweigh the perinatal risks, i.e. intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or death.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the short-term outcome of VLBWI on IVH according to mode of delivery in a population-based cohort of the German Neonatal Network (GNN).
STUDY DESIGN: A total cohort of 2203 singleton VLBWI with a birth weight <1500g and gestational age between 22 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks born and discharged between 1st of January 2009 and 31st of December 2015 was available for analysis. VLBWI were stratified into three categories according to mode of delivery: (1) planned cesarean section (n=1381), (2) vaginal delivery (n=632) and (3) emergency cesarean section (n=190). Outcome was assessed in univariate and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Prevalence of IVH was significantly higher in the vaginal delivery (VD) (26.6%) and emergency CS group (31.1%) as compared to planned CS (17.2%), respectively. In a logistic regression analysis including known risk factors for IVH, vaginal delivery (OR 1.725 [1.325-2.202], p≤0.001) and emergency cesarean section (OR 1.916 [1.338-2.746], p≤0.001) were independently associated with IVH risk. In the subgroup of infants >30 weeks of gestation prevalence for IVH was not significantly different in VD and planned CS (5.3% vs. 4.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our observational data demonstrate that elective cesarean section is associated with a reduced risk of IVH in preterm infants <30 weeks gestational age when presenting with preterm labor."

We investigated the clinicopathological characteristics, survival impact, and appropriateness of ascribing No. 7 station LNs to D1 lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer. Patients (n=608) undergoing radical resection with No. 7 station LN dissection were recruited between January 1997 and June 2008. They were subdivided into four groups: N0, no LN metastasis; D1, LN without No. 7 station LN metastasis in the D1 lymphadenectomy region; No. 7, No. 7 station LN without LN metastasis in the D2 lymphadenectomy region; and D2, LN without No. 7 station LN metastasis in the D2 lymphadenectomy region. Of these, 17.2% (n=105) were positive for No. 7 LN metastasis, an important, independent prognostic factor associated with poor clinicopathological parameters, advanced tumor stage, and reduced survival. Tumor behavior in the No. 7 group was similar to that in the D2 group, but poorer than in the D1 group in terms of advanced tumor stage, with 5-year survival rates of 34.3%, 25.9% and 54.6%, respectively. Five-year survival rates in the No. 7 group were comparable to those in the D2 group (P>0.05), but significantly lower than in the D1 group (P<0.05). Logistic multivariate regression analysis established No. 3 and 9 station LN metastasis, node classification, and tumor-node-metastasis stage as independent risk factors for No. 7 station LN metastasis. Thus, No. 7 station LNs should be ascribed to D2 lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer."

There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at an increased risk of developing psychological effects from the pandemic. Given the differences in the response of individuals to stress, an analysis of both the perceived and physiological consequences of stressors can provide a comprehensive evaluation of its impact.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine characteristics associated with longitudinal perceived stress in HCWs and to assess whether changes in heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic nervous system function, are associated with features protective against longitudinal stress.
METHODS: HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City, NY, were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study to measure HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys measuring perceived stress, resilience, emotional support, quality of life, and optimism were collected at baseline and longitudinally.
RESULTS: A total of 361 participants (mean age 36.8, SD 10.1 years; female: n=246, 69.3%) were enrolled. Multivariate analysis found New York City's COVID-19 case count to be associated with increased longitudinal stress (P=.008). Baseline emotional support, quality of life, and resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (P<.001). A significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis was observed in the highest tertial of emotional support (P=.03) and resilience (P=.006). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had a significantly different circadian pattern of longitudinally collected HRV compared to subjects in the low or medium tertial.
CONCLUSIONS: High resilience, emotional support, and quality of life place HCWs at reduced risk of longitudinal perceived stress and have a distinct physiological stress profile. Our findings support the use of these characteristics to identify HCWs at risk of the psychological and physiological stress effects of the pandemic."

METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, we assigned patients with chronic coronary disease to receive 0.5 mg of colchicine once daily or matching placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous (nonprocedural) myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization. The key secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: A total of 5522 patients underwent randomization; 2762 were assigned to the colchicine group and 2760 to the placebo group. The median duration of follow-up was 28.6 months. A primary end-point event occurred in 187 patients (6.8%) in the colchicine group and in 264 patients (9.6%) in the placebo group (incidence, 2.5 vs. 3.6 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.83; P<0.001).

Sepsis is now increasingly being considered a dysregulated systemic inflammatory and immune response to microbial invasion that produces organ injury for which mortality rates are declining to 15-25%. Septic shock remains defined as sepsis with hyperlactataemia and concurrent hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy, with in-hospital mortality rates approaching 30-50%. With earlier recognition and more compliance to best practices, sepsis has become less of an immediate life-threatening disorder and more of a long-term chronic critical illness, often associated with prolonged inflammation, immune suppression, organ injury and lean tissue wasting. Furthermore, patients who survive sepsis have continuing risk of mortality after discharge, as well as long-term cognitive and functional deficits. Earlier recognition and improved implementation of best practices have reduced in-hospital mortality, but results from the use of immunomodulatory agents to date have been disappointing. Similarly, no biomarker can definitely diagnose sepsis or predict its clinical outcome. Because of its complexity, improvements in sepsis outcomes are likely to continue to be slow and incremental."

They are involved in the fine-tuning of fundamental biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis in many cell types. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate critical pathways involved in stem cell function. Several miRNAs have been suggested to target transcripts that directly or indirectly coordinate the cell cycle progression of stem cells. Moreover, previous studies have shown that altered expression levels of miRNAs can contribute to pathological conditions, such as cancer, due to the loss of cell cycle regulation. However, the precise mechanism underlying miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle in stem cells is still incompletely understood. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of miRNAs regulatory role in cell cycle progression of stem cells. We describe how specific miRNAs may control cell cycle associated molecules and checkpoints in embryonic, somatic and cancer stem cells. We further outline how these miRNAs could be regulated to influence cell cycle progression in stem cells as a potential clinical application."

As a deintensification strategy, we studied primary transoral surgery (TOS) and reduced postoperative radiation therapy (RT) in intermediate-risk HPV+ OPC.
METHODS: E3311 is a phase II randomized trial of reduced- or standard-dose postoperative RT for resected stage III-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer-seventh edition) HPV+ OPC, determined by pathologic parameters. Primary goals were feasibility of prospective multi-institutional study of TOS for HPV+ OPC, and oncologic efficacy (2-year progression-free survival) of TOS and adjuvant therapy in intermediate-risk patients after resection. TOS plus 50 Gy was considered promising if the lower limit of the exact 90% binomial confidence intervals exceeded 85%. Quality of life and swallowing were measured by functional assessment of cancer therapy-head and neck and MD Anderson Dysphagia Index.
RESULTS: Credentialed surgeons performed TOS for 495 patients. Eligible and treated patients were assigned as follows: arm A (low risk, n = 38) enrolled 11%, intermediate risk arms B (50 Gy, n = 100) or C (60 Gy, n = 108) randomly allocated 58%, and arm D (high risk, n = 113) enrolled 31%. With a median 35.2-month follow-up for 359 evaluable (eligible and treated) patients, 2-year progression-free survival Kaplan-Meier estimate is 96.9% (90% CI, 91.9 to 100) for arm A (observation), 94.9% (90% CI, 91.3 to 98.6]) for arm B (50 Gy), 96.0% (90% CI, 92.8 to 99.3) for arm C (60 Gy), and 90.7% (90% CI, 86.2 to 95.4) for arm D (66 Gy plus weekly cisplatin). Treatment arm distribution and oncologic outcome for ineligible or step 2 untreated patients (n = 136) mirrored the 359 evaluable patients. Exploratory comparison of functional assessment of cancer therapy-head and neck total scores between arms B and C is presented.
CONCLUSION: Primary TOS and reduced postoperative RT result in outstanding oncologic outcome and favorable functional outcomes in intermediate-risk HPV+ OPC."

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, open-label trial in Germany that involved patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and end-stage heart failure who were referred for heart transplantation evaluation. Patients were assigned to receive catheter ablation and guideline-directed medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or urgent heart transplantation.
RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were assigned to the ablation group and 97 to the medical-therapy group. The trial was stopped for efficacy by the data and safety monitoring board 1 year after randomization was completed. Catheter ablation was performed in 81 of 97 patients (84%) in the ablation group and in 16 of 97 patients (16%) in the medical-therapy group. After a median follow-up of 18.0 months (interquartile range, 14.6 to 22.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 8 patients (8%) in the ablation group and in 29 patients (30%) in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.52; P<0.001).

METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, we performed sequencing using a custom multigene amplicon-based panel to identify germline pathogenic variants in 28 cancer-predisposition genes among 32,247 women with breast cancer (case patients) and 32,544 unaffected women (controls) from population-based studies in the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium. Associations between pathogenic variants in each gene and the risk of breast cancer were assessed.
RESULTS: Pathogenic variants in 12 established breast cancer-predisposition genes were detected in 5.03% of case patients and in 1.63% of controls. Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were associated with a high risk of breast cancer, with odds ratios of 7.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.33 to 11.27) and 5.23 (95% CI, 4.09 to 6.77), respectively. Pathogenic variants in PALB2 were associated with a moderate risk (odds ratio, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.68 to 5.63). Pathogenic variants in BARD1, RAD51C, and RAD51D were associated with increased risks of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, whereas pathogenic variants in ATM, CDH1, and CHEK2 were associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Pathogenic variants in 16 candidate breast cancer-predisposition genes, including the c.657_661del5 founder pathogenic variant in NBN, were not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides estimates of the prevalence and risk of breast cancer associated with pathogenic variants in known breast cancer-predisposition genes in the U.S. population. These estimates can inform cancer testing and screening and improve clinical management strategies for women in the general population with inherited pathogenic variants in these genes.

Evidence comparing these systems has been based primarily on observational studies.
METHODS: We conducted a noninferiority trial in which patients with an indication for an ICD but no indication for pacing were assigned to receive a subcutaneous ICD or transvenous ICD. The primary end point was the composite of device-related complications and inappropriate shocks; the noninferiority margin for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio (subcutaneous ICD vs. transvenous ICD) was 1.45. A superiority analysis was prespecified if noninferiority was established. Secondary end points included death and appropriate shocks.
RESULTS: A total of 849 patients (426 in the subcutaneous ICD group and 423 in the transvenous ICD group) were included in the analyses.

Device-related complications occurred in 31 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 44 in the transvenous ICD group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.09); inappropriate shocks occurred in 41 and 29 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30). Death occurred in 83 patients in the subcutaneous ICD group and in 68 in the transvenous ICD group (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.70); appropriate shocks occurred in 83 and 57 patients, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.12).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an indication for an ICD but no indication for pacing, the subcutaneous ICD was noninferior to the transvenous ICD with respect to device-related complications and inappropriate shocks.

The secondary aim was to identify factors associated with burnout in this population. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines by searching PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, and Scopus from 1 January to 24 November 2020. Studies with information about burnout prevalence/level during the pandemic regarding ICU/ED HCWs were eligible. A total of 927 records were identified. The selection resulted in 11 studies. Most studies were conducted in April/May 2020. Samples ranged from 15 to 12,596 participants. The prevalence of overall burnout ranged from 49.3% to 58%. Nurses seemed to be at higher risk. Both socio-demographic and work-related features were associated with burnout. Many pandemic-related variables were associated with burnout, e.g., shortage in resources, worry regarding COVID-19, and stigma. This review highlighted a substantial burnout prevalence among ICU/ED HCWs. However, this population has presented a high burnout prevalence for a long time, and there is not sufficient evidence to understand if such prevalence is currently increased.

Epub 2019 Mar 18.,Pluymaekers NAHA,N Engl J Med,2019,2019/03/19,,,10.1056/NEJMoa1900353,"BACKGROUND: Patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation commonly undergo immediate restoration of sinus rhythm by pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion. However, whether immediate restoration of sinus rhythm is necessary is not known, since atrial fibrillation often terminates spontaneously.
METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients with hemodynamically stable, recent-onset (<36 hours), symptomatic atrial fibrillation in the emergency department to be treated with a wait-and-see approach (delayed-cardioversion group) or early cardioversion. The wait-and-see approach involved initial treatment with rate-control medication only and delayed cardioversion if the atrial fibrillation did not resolve within 48 hours. The primary end point was the presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks. Noninferiority would be shown if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the primary end point in percentage points was more than -10.
RESULTS: The presence of sinus rhythm at 4 weeks occurred in 193 of 212 patients (91%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 202 of 215 (94%) in the early-cardioversion group (between-group difference, -2.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.2 to 2.2; P = 0.005 for noninferiority). In the delayed-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm within 48 hours occurred spontaneously in 150 of 218 patients (69%) and after delayed cardioversion in 61 patients (28%). In the early-cardioversion group, conversion to sinus rhythm occurred spontaneously before the initiation of cardioversion in 36 of 219 patients (16%) and after cardioversion in 171 patients (78%). Among the patients who completed remote monitoring during 4 weeks of follow-up, a recurrence of atrial fibrillation occurred in 49 of 164 patients (30%) in the delayed-cardioversion group and in 50 of 171 (29%) in the early-cardioversion group. Within 4 weeks after randomization, cardiovascular complications occurred in 10 patients and 8 patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting to the emergency department with recent-onset, symptomatic atrial fibrillation, a wait-and-see approach was noninferior to early cardioversion in achieving a return to sinus rhythm at 4 weeks.

However, like other new technologies, the best application of WGS remains to be determined, for both conceptual and technical reasons. In this review, we consider the potential value of WGS in the clinical laboratory for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the prediction of antibiotic resistance. We also discuss issues pertaining to data generation, interpretation and dissemination, given that WGS has to date been generally performed in research labs where results are not necessarily packaged in a clinician-friendly format. Although WGS is far more accessible now than it was in the past, the transition from a research tool to study TB into a clinical test to manage this disease may require further fine-tuning. Improvements will likely come through iterative efforts that involve both the laboratories ready to move TB into the genomic era and the front-line clinical/public health staff who will be interpreting the results to inform management decisions."

The aim of this study was to analyse interventions related to anaesthesia tracheal intubations in this European cohort and identify their clinical consequences.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of tracheal intubations of the European multicentre observational trial (NEonate and Children audiT of Anaesthesia pRactice IN Europe [NECTARINE]) in neonates and small infants with difficult tracheal intubation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of difficult intubation and the related complications. The secondary endpoints were the risk factors for severe hypoxaemia attributed to difficult airway management, and 30 and 90 day outcomes.
RESULTS: Tracheal intubation was planned in 4683 procedures. Difficult tracheal intubation, defined as two failed attempts of direct laryngoscopy, occurred in 266 children (271 procedures) with an incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.5). Bradycardia occurred in 8% of the cases with difficult intubation, whereas a significant decrease in oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>&lt;90% for 60 s) was reported in 40%. No associated risk factors could be identified among co-morbidities, surgical, or anaesthesia management. Using propensity scoring to adjust for confounders, difficult anaesthesia tracheal intubation did not lead to an increase in 30 and 90 day morbidity or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate a high incidence of difficult tracheal intubation in children less than 60 weeks post-conceptual age commonly resulting in severe hypoxaemia. Reassuringly, the morbidity and mortality at 30 and 90 days was not increased by the occurrence of a difficult intubation event.

It is involved in numerous functional activities, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, structural stability, and gene expression. Despite this, FHL2-knockout (KO) mice are viable and fertile with no obvious abnormalities, rather suggesting a high capacity for fine-tuning adjustment and functional redundancy of FHL2. Indeed, challenging FHL2-KO cells or mice provided numerous evidences for the great functional significance of FHL2. In recent years, several reviews have been published describing the high capacity of FHL2 to bind diverse proteins as well as the versatile functions of FHL2, emphasizing in particular its role in cardiovascular diseases and carcinogenesis. Here, we view the function of FHL2 from a different perspective. We summarize the published data demonstrating the impact of FHL2 on wound healing and inflammation. FHL2 seems to be involved in numerous steps of these extremely complex and multidirectional but tightly regulated tissue remodeling processes, supporting tissue repair and coordinating inflammation. Deficiency of FHL2 not only slows down ongoing wound healing but also often turns it into a chronic condition.-Wixler, V. The role of FHL2 in wound healing and inflammation."

This requires readjustment of the functional balance of the sialic acid receptor-binding hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) to the sialoglycan-receptor repertoire of the new host. Novel techniques have revealed mechanistic details of this HA-NA-receptor balance, emphasizing a previously underappreciated crucial role for NA in driving the motility of receptor-associated IAV particles. Motility enables virion penetration of the sialylated mucus layer as well as attachment to, and uptake into, underlying epithelial cells. As IAVs are essentially irreversibly bound in the absence of NA activity, the fine-tuning of the HA-NA-receptor balance rather than the binding avidity of IAV particles per se is an important factor in determining host species tropism."

The pathogenesis of IDH is directly linked to the discontinuous nature of the HD treatment, in combination with patient-related factors such as age, diabetes mellitus and cardiac failure.
SUMMARY: Although the decline in blood volume due to removal of fluid by ultrafiltration is the prime mover, thermally induced reflex vasodilation compromises the haemodynamic response to hypovolemia. Recent studies have stressed the relevance of changes in tissue perfusion during HD, which may translate in long-term organ damage. Monitoring changes in tissue perfusion, for which emerging evidence becomes available, appears to have great promise in the fine-tuning of the dialysis procedure. Key Messages: While it is unlikely that IDH can be completely prevented, reduction in inter-dialytic weight gain, prevention of an increase in core temperature by adjusting the dialysate temperature and more frequent or prolonged dialysis treatment remain cornerstones in providing a more comfortable and safe treatment."

The pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from the viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the host cell, especially from those of the immune cells. Sensing of PAMPs by PRRs elicits an elegant signal transduction system, ultimately leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. Ubiquitination, with its versatile functions, plays a central role in modulating almost every single step of this signaling cascade. Ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze different types of ubiquitination correlating with multiple functions, are the key participant in fine-tuning antiviral signal transduction.

Nevertheless, many patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease have expressed concerns about possible cognitive decline and may have opted to forgo statin therapy. In this overview, the evidence leading to the statement by the FDA is reviewed. Potential mechanisms of the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction and statin therapy on cognition are discussed. Evidence from observational and prospective randomized trials is summarized, leading to the conclusion that as for now, there is no good evidence that statins cause cognitive impairment to a significant degree.

Especially human immunodeficiency virus sparked a global pandemic, but could be converted into a versatile tool for cell therapy. For all retroviral genera, the way from virus to vector was similar resulting in split-vector systems based on the separation of the genes needed for vector particle formation and transgene expression. The first gene therapy trials, although clinically effective, revealed the genotoxicity of retroviral vectors caused by insertional mutagenesis. This issue was solved using self-inactivating vectors carrying weaker cellular promoters. Further fine-tuning was able to generate inducible systems. The current toolbox also contains vectors for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells or efficient RNA interference. More recently the application of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing led to the development of genome-wide small guide RNA libraries targeting all human genes and single lentiviral vectors for an easy delivery of Cas9."

Mitochondria are also involved in the cellular innate immune response against microorganisms or environmental irritants, particularly in mammals. Mitochondrial-mediated innate immunity is achieved by the activation of two discrete signaling pathways, the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasomes and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor pathway. In both pathways, a mitochondrial outer membrane adaptor protein, called mitochondrial antiviral signaling MAVS, and mitochondria-derived components play a key role in signal transduction. In this review, we discuss current insights regarding the fundamental phenomena of mitochondrial-related innate immune responses, and review the specific roles of various mitochondrial subcompartments in fine-tuning innate immune signaling events. We propose that specific targeting of mitochondrial functions is a potential therapeutic approach for the management of infectious diseases and autoinflammatory disorders with an excessive immune response."

We sought an answer to the question whether the advances and major changes in lipid management are relevant and apply to children and adolescents.
RECENT FINDINGS: Latest research findings clearly demonstrate that lowering cholesterol levels at a young age prevents vascular atherosclerotic changes and decreases cardiovascular events in adulthood and emphasizes the importance of early detection and intervention in the pediatric FH patients group. FH is a common genetic disease caused by mutations in genes associated with the metabolism of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The hallmark of FH is elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from birth and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Often FH is either undiagnosed or diagnosed with a considerable delay, leading to vascular atherosclerotic changes and cardiovascular disease. Prompt identification of FH subjects is essential, to initiate early preventive measures. Safe and efficient pharmacological agents are approved for use in children and adolescents. Statins are the first line of therapy, in combination of ezetimibe. Unfortunately, these drugs do not warrant the achievement of therapeutic target, especially in HoFH patient. In the latter, lipoprotein apheresis (LA), which has been shown to be safe and effective, is strongly recommended. Finally, the new drugs still under study will allow a multimodal customized treatment. Lowering cholesterol levels at a young age hinders vascular atherosclerotic changes decreasing cardiovascular events in adulthood. Therefore, early detection, diagnosis, and intervention in FH patients are priority objectives."

Virus-specific adaptive immunity can, however, also trigger pathological processes characterized by localized or systemic inflammatory events. The protective and/or pathological role of virus-specific T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection has been the focus of many studies in COVID-19 patients and in vaccinated individuals. Here, we review the works that have elucidated the function of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in patients and in vaccinated individuals. Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are more linked to protection or pathogenesis is pivotal to define future therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to manage the current pandemic."

Although current direct antiviral therapies are very efficient in controlling viral replication and limiting the progression to cirrhosis, these treatments require lifelong administration due to the frequent viral rebound upon treatment cessation, and immune modulation with interferon is only effective in a subgroup of patients. Specific immunotherapies can offer the possibility of eliminating or at least stably maintaining low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional host antiviral response. Here, we review the development of immune cell therapy for HBV, highlighting the potential antiviral efficiency and potential toxicities in different groups of chronically infected HBV patients. We also discuss the chronic hepatitis B patient populations that best benefit from therapeutic immune interventions."

The aim of this review is to focus on the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main products of gut microbial fermentation from non-digestible carbohydrates in the colon, on the gut-brain axis. Evidence is accumulating regarding the role of SCFAs in the fine-tuning of the gut-brain axis, a feedback system which is vital not only for the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal and metabolic functions, but also for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. SCFAs are thought to play a key role in increasing the host capacity to harvest excess energy from the diet. SCFAs, however, can exert their effects on the host metabolism via multiple complementary pathways. Metabolic, inflammatory, and neural pathways can be regulated by SCFAs, which can act by sensing nutritional status, thereby maintaining body energy homeostasis. SCFA production from prebiotic consumption is the rationale for targeting intestinal mechanisms to increase energy expenditure and thereby reduce obesity risk."

In this review, we explore the possible reasons for the ongoing high prevalence of cancer pain and discuss possible future directions for improvement in personalised pain management. Among possible reasons for the lack of improvement are: Barriers for patients to discuss pain with clinicians spontaneously; pain measurement instruments are not routinely used in daily practice; limited knowledge concerning the assessment of undertreatment; changes in patients' characteristics, including the ageing of the population; lack of significant improvement in the treatment of neuropathic pain; limitations of pharmacological treatment and lack of evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment strategies. In order to improve cancer pain treatment, we recommend: (1) Physicians proactively ask about pain and measure pain using assessment instruments; (2) the development of an optimal tool measuring undertreatment; (3) educational interventions to improve health care workers' skills in pain management; (4) the development of more effective and personalised pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain treatment."

Commercially available LLMs, however, are not optimized for clinical uses and are prone to generating incorrect or hallucinatory information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an enterprise architecture that allows embedding of customized data into LLMs. This approach ""specializes"" the LLMs and is thought to reduce hallucinations.
METHODS: We developed ""LiVersa,"" a liver disease-specific LLM, by using our institution's protected health information (PHI)-complaint text embedding and LLM platform, ""Versa."" We conducted RAG on 30 publicly available American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines and guidance documents to be incorporated into LiVersa. We evaluated LiVersa's performance by comparing its responses versus those of trainees from a previously published knowledge assessment study regarding hepatitis B (HBV) treatment and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance.
RESULTS: LiVersa answered all 10 questions correctly when forced to provide a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Full detailed responses with justifications and rationales, however, were not completely correct for three of the questions.
DISCUSSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated the ability to build disease-specific and PHI-compliant LLMs using RAG. While our LLM, LiVersa, demonstrated more specificity in answering questions related to clinical hepatology - there were some knowledge deficiencies due to limitations set by the number and types of documents used for RAG. The LiVersa prototype, however, is a proof of concept for utilizing RAG to customize LLMs for clinical uses and a potential strategy to realize personalized medicine in the future."

Epub 2021 Jul 20.,Liu B,Mol Psychiatry,2022,2021/07/21,,,10.1038/s41380-021-01233-8,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by the aggregation of neurotoxic proteins in the central nervous system. Aberrant protein accumulation in NDs is largely caused by the dysfunction of the two principal protein catabolism pathways, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The two protein quality control pathways are bridged by ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that can induce protein degradation via both the UPS and the ALP. Perturbed ubiquitination leads to the formation of toxic aggregates and inclusion bodies that are deleterious to neurons. Ubiquitination is promoted by a cascade of ubiquitinating enzymes and counter-regulated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). As fine-tuning regulators of ubiquitination and protein degradation, DUBs modulate the stability of ND-associated pathogenic proteins including amyloid β protein, Tau, and α-synuclein. Besides, DUBs also influence ND-associated mitophagy, protein secretion, and neuroinflammation. Given the various and critical functions of DUBs in NDs, DUBs may become potential therapeutic targets for NDs."

Whether a general-purpose AI language model can perform diagnosis and triage is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Compare the general-purpose Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) AI model's diagnostic and triage performance to attending physicians and lay adults who use the Internet.
DESIGN: We compared the accuracy of GPT-3's diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated case vignettes of both common (e.g., viral illness) and severe (e.g., heart attack) conditions to lay people and practicing physicians. Finally, we examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was for diagnosis and triage.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The GPT-3 model, a nationally representative sample of lay people, and practicing physicians.
EXPOSURE: Validated case vignettes (&lt;60 words; &lt;6th grade reading level).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correct diagnosis, correct triage.
RESULTS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top 3 for 88% (95% CI, 75% to 94%) of cases, compared to 54% (95% CI, 53% to 55%) for lay individuals (p<0.001) and 96% (95% CI, 94% to 97%) for physicians (p=0.0354). GPT-3 triaged (71% correct; 95% CI, 57% to 82%) similarly to lay individuals (74%; 95% CI, 73% to 75%; p=0.73); both were significantly worse than physicians (91%; 95% CI, 89% to 93%; p<0.001). As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well-calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score = 0.18) and triage (Brier score = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below physicians and better than lay individuals. The model was performed less well on triage, where its performance was closer to that of lay individuals."

Early diagnosis is the milestone in their mitigation, control, and eradication. Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false-negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine-tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high-throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces, should be given considerable attention in the future. These approaches will have a substantial positive impact on the mitigation and eradication of coronaviruses, including the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."

METHODS: We randomly assigned 1644 patients without an established indication for oral anticoagulation after successful TAVR to receive rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg daily (with aspirin at a dose of 75 to 100 mg daily for the first 3 months) (rivaroxaban group) or aspirin at a dose of 75 to 100 mg daily (with clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg daily for the first 3 months) (antiplatelet group). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of death or thromboembolic events. The primary safety outcome was major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding. The trial was terminated prematurely by the data and safety monitoring board because of safety concerns.
RESULTS: After a median of 17 months, death or a first thromboembolic event (intention-to-treat analysis) had occurred in 105 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 78 patients in the antiplatelet group (incidence rates, 9.8 and 7.2 per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio with rivaroxaban, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.81; P = 0.04). Major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding (intention-to-treat analysis) had occurred in 46 and 31 patients, respectively (4.3 and 2.8 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.37; P = 0.08).

METHODS: We selected experimental and observational studies examining the efficacy (as reduction of desire to smoke and/or number of cigarettes smoked and/or quitting or as reduction of nicotine withdrawal symptoms) and the safety of EC (AEs self-reported or clinical/laboratory). The following search engines were used: PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register.
RESULTS: Finally, six experimental studies and six cohort studies were included. In the prospective 12-month, randomized controlled trial, smoking reduction was documented in 22.3 and 10.3% at Weeks 12 and 52, respectively (P < 0.001 versus baseline). Moreover, two cohort studies reported a reduction in the number of cigarette/day (from 50 to 80%) after the introduction of the EC. 'Mouth and throat irritation', 'nausea', 'headache' and 'dry cough' were the most frequently AEs reported.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the EC can reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and withdrawal symptoms, but the AEs reported are mainly related to a short period of use. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the EC usage after a chronic exposure."

METHODS: PubMED and NHS EED were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: English or Dutch language, model-based economic evaluation, chemotherapy or TT as intervention, population diagnosed with MBC, published between 2000 and 2014, reporting life years (LY) or quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. General characteristics, model characteristics and outcomes of the studies were extracted. Quality of the studies was assessed through a checklist.
RESULTS: 24 studies were included, considering 50 comparisons (20 concerning chemotherapy and 30 TT). Seven comparisons were represented in multiple studies. A health state-transition model including the following health states: stable/progression-free disease, progression and death was used in 18 studies. Studies fulfilled on average 14 out of the 26 items of the quality checklist, mostly due to a lack of transparency in reporting. Thirty-one per cent of the incremental net monetary benefit was positive. TT led to higher iQALY gained, and industry-sponsored studies reported more favourable cost-effectiveness outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a disease-specific reference model would improve the transparency and quality of model-based cost-effectiveness assessments for MBC treatments. Incremental health benefits increased over time, but were outweighed by the increased treatment costs. Consequently, increased health benefits led to lower value for money."

This study aims to determine the incidence and predictive risk factors for drug-resistant IGE.
METHODS: We systematically searched three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) in November 2022 and included 12 eligible studies which reported long-term outcomes (mean = 14.05) after antiseizure medications (ASMs) from 2001 to 2020. We defined drug resistance as the persistence of any seizure despite ASMs treatment (whether as monotherapies or in combination) given the criteria of drug resistance varied in original studies. A random-effects model was used to evaluate the prevalence of refractory IGE. Studies reporting potential poor prognostic factors were included for subsequent subgroup meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of drug resistance in IGE cohorts was 27% (95% CI: 0.19-0.36). Subgroup analysis of the risk factors revealed that the psychiatric comorbidities (odds ratio (OR): 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.97-7.98), combined three seizure types (absences, myoclonic jerks, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures) (OR: 5.37, 95% CI: 3.16-9.13), the presence of absence seizure (OR: 4.38, 95% CI: 2.64-7.28), generalized polyspike trains (GPT) (OR: 4.83, 95% CI: 2.42-9.64), sex/catamenial epilepsy (OR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.97-5.37), and status epilepticus (OR: 5.94, 95% CI: 2.23-15.85) increased the risk of poor prognosis. Other factors, including age onset, family history, and side effects of ASMs, were insignificantly associated with a higher incidence of refractory IGE.
CONCLUSION: Drug resistance is a severe complication of IGE. Further standardized research about clinical and electroencephalography factors is warranted."

While cardiovascular outcomes of diabetes are improving over time, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) still leads to an exceedingly high rate of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). A game-changing opportunity is offered by treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indisputably shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the rate of DKD progression, the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the development of ESKD. In parallel, SGLT2 inhibitors improve cardiovascular outcomes, especially the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Real-world studies (RWSs) have largely confirmed the findings of RCTs in broader populations of subjects with T2D followed under routine care. In the present paper, we review RWSs exploring the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and highlight the most critical challenges that can be encountered in designing and conducting such studies. Channelling bias (confounding by indication), time-lag bias, conditioning on the future, database heterogeneity, linearity of eGFR change over time, and duration of observation are critical issues that may undermine the robustness of RWS findings. We then elaborate on the new opportunities to overcome such limitations by describing the design and objectives of the DARWIN (DApagliflozin Real-World evIdeNce)-Renal study, a new RWS promoted by the Italian Diabetes Society. Fine-tuning of methods for comparative observational research will improve evidence derived from RWSs on the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, aiding the evolving discussion regarding the place of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2D treatment algorithms in different stages of DKD."

METHODS: We selected observational studies published from January 1990 until January 2014 that examined the use of self-medication in the adolescents (aged from 13 to 18 years). Keywords used on PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus were 'self medication', 'adolescent*', 'self prescription', 'over the counter preparations' and 'self administration'.
RESULTS: Finally, 15 articles met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 143 213 subjects involved. Overall, 50% of adolescents use to take drugs without consulting a physician. Further analyses stratified by number of drugs used demonstrated that in the studies reporting that adolescents use more than one type of drug the prevalence rises up to 63%. Only one study reported the possible adverse effects related to the inappropriate use of drugs, which were experienced by 31.1% of the females and 19.6% of the males.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-medication use among adolescents is a widespread phenomenon. It would be advisable to give more attention on this public health concern and to promote initiatives, such as mass media campaigns and governmental actions, in order to make the citizens more aware to the risks related to the consumption of drugs without medical consultation. Further studies on adverse effects are urgently needed."

How well a general-purpose AI language model performs diagnosis and triage relative to physicians and laypeople is not well understood.
METHODS: We compared the predictive accuracy of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3)'s diagnostic and triage ability for 48 validated synthetic case vignettes (<50 words; sixth-grade reading level or below) of both common (eg, viral illness) and severe (eg, heart attack) conditions to a nationally representative sample of 5000 lay people from the USA who could use the internet to find the correct options and 21 practising physicians at Harvard Medical School. There were 12 vignettes for each of four triage categories: emergent, within one day, within 1 week, and self-care. The correct diagnosis and triage category (ie, ground truth) for each vignette was determined by two general internists at Harvard Medical School. For each vignette, human respondents and GPT-3 were prompted to list diagnoses in order of likelihood, and the vignette was marked as correct if the ground-truth diagnosis was in the top three of the listed diagnoses. For triage accuracy, we examined whether the human respondents' and GPT-3's selected triage was exactly correct according to the four triage categories, or matched a dichotomised triage variable (emergent or within 1 day vs within 1 week or self-care). We estimated GPT-3's diagnostic and triage confidence on a given vignette using a modified bootstrap resampling procedure, and examined how well calibrated GPT-3's confidence was by computing calibration curves and Brier scores. We also performed subgroup analysis by case acuity, and an error analysis for triage advice to characterise how its advice might affect patients using this tool to decide if they should seek medical care immediately.
FINDINGS: Among all cases, GPT-3 replied with the correct diagnosis in its top three for 88% (42/48, 95% CI 75-94) of cases, compared with 54% (2700/5000, 53-55) for lay individuals (p<0.0001) and 96% (637/666, 94-97) for physicians (p=0·012). GPT-3 triaged 70% correct (34/48, 57-82) versus 74% (3706/5000, 73-75; p=0.60) for lay individuals and 91% (608/666, 89-93%; p<0.0001) for physicians. As measured by the Brier score, GPT-3 confidence in its top prediction was reasonably well calibrated for diagnosis (Brier score=0·18) and triage (Brier score=0·22). We observed an inverse relationship between case acuity and GPT-3 accuracy (p<0·0001) with a fitted trend line of -8·33% decrease in accuracy for every level of increase in case acuity. For triage error analysis, GPT-3 deprioritised truly emergent cases in seven instances.
INTERPRETATION: A general-purpose AI language model without any content-specific training could perform diagnosis at levels close to, but below, physicians and better than lay individuals. We found that GPT-3's performance was inferior to physicians for triage, sometimes by a large margin, and its performance was closer to that of lay individuals. Although the diagnostic performance of GPT-3 was comparable to physicians, it was significantly better than a typical person using a search engine.

To deal with host antiviral responses viruses evolved mechanisms to avoid or counteract this, most notably through expression of viral suppressors of RNA silencing. Besides working as silencing suppressors, these proteins may also fulfill other functions during infection. In many cases the interplay between the suppressor function and other ""unrelated"" functions remains elusive. We will present host factors implicated in antiviral pathways and summarize the current status of knowledge about the diverse viral suppressors' strategies acting at various steps of antiviral silencing in plants. Besides, we will consider the multi-functionality of these versatile proteins and related biochemical processes in which they may be involved in fine-tuning the plant-virus interaction. Finally, we will present the current applications and discuss perspectives of the use of these proteins in molecular biology and biotechnology."

ICTs are classified on the basis of whether they are combinations of conventional human insulin, human insulin analogs, insulin coformulations, and insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and have a subtle difference in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. ICTs have been consistently demonstrated to play a major role in improving glycemic control. In a different meta-analysis involving patients assessed for glycemic control as the primary endpoint, no significant difference was noted with regard to HbA1c reduction, hypoglycemia, weight change, and daily insulin dose in patients on basal-bolus regimen, as compared to ICTs. All international guidelines recommend ICTs for treatment intensification.ICTs provide more flexibility to the treating doctor in fine-tuning the insulin/GLP-1RA regimen and have the advantages of reducing daily needle-prick count and better long-term compliance."

Epub 2016 Apr 5.,Piedade D,Rev Med Virol,2016,2016/04/10,,,10.1002/rmv.1881,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that modulate protein production by post-transcriptional gene regulation. They impose gene expression control by interfering with mRNA translation and stability in cell cytoplasm through a mechanism involving specific binding to mRNA based on base pair complementarity. Because of their intracellular replication cycle it is no surprise that viruses evolved in a way that allows them to use microRNAs to infect, replicate and persist in host cells. Several ways of interference between virus and host-cell microRNA machinery have been described. Most of the time, viruses drastically alter host-cell microRNA expression or synthesize their own microRNA to facilitate infection and pathogenesis. HIV and HCV are two prominent examples of this complex interplay revealing how fine-tuning of microRNA expression is crucial for controlling key host pathways that allow viral infection and replication, immune escape and persistence. In this review we delve into the mechanisms underlying cellular and viral-encoded microRNA functions in the context of HIV and HCV infections. We focus on which microRNAs are differently expressed and deregulated upon viral infection and how these alterations dictate the fate of virus and cell. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Advances in structural biology techniques have contributed substantially to our current understanding of the life cycle of these small enveloped RNA viruses and led to deep insights into details of virus assembly, maturation and cell entry. In addition to large-scale conformational changes and oligomeric rearrangements of envelope proteins during these processes, there is increasing evidence that smaller-scale protein dynamics (referred to as virus ""breathing"") can confer extra flexibility to these viruses for the fine-tuning of their interactions with the immune system and possibly with cellular factors they encounter in their complex ecological cycles in arthropod and vertebrate hosts. In this review, we discuss how work with tick-borne encephalitis virus has extended our view on flavivirus breathing, leading to the identification of a novel mechanism of antibody-mediated infection enhancement and demonstrating breathing intermediates of the envelope protein in the process of membrane fusion. These data are discussed in the context of other flaviviruses and the perspective of a potential role of virus breathing to cope with the requirements of adaptation and replication in evolutionarily very different hosts."

Our previous review article provided an overview of non-invasive, non-EEG (electro-encephalography) body signals that can be measured, along with corresponding methods, state of the art research, and commercially available systems. Three years later, many more studies and devices have emerged. Moreover, the boom of smart phones and tablets created a new market for seizure detection applications.
METHOD: We performed a thorough literature review and had contact with manufacturers of commercially available devices.
RESULTS: This review article gives an updated overview of body signals and methods for seizure detection, international research and (commercially) available systems and applications. Reported results of non-EEG based detection devices vary between 2.2% and 100% sensitivity and between 0 and 3.23 false detections per hour compared to the gold standard video-EEG, for seizures ranging from generalized to convulsive or non-convulsive focal seizures with or without loss of consciousness. It is particularly interesting to include monitoring of autonomic dysfunction, as this may be an important pathophysiological mechanism of SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy), and of movement, as many seizures have a motor component.
CONCLUSION: Comparison of research results is difficult as studies focus on different seizure types, timing (night versus day) and patients (adult versus pediatric patients). Nevertheless, we are convinced that the most effective seizure detection systems are multimodal, combining for example detection methods for movement and heart rate, and that devices should especially take into account the user's seizure types and personal preferences."

Infection starts by attachment to host receptors, a crucial step that is targeted by immunological, prophylactic, and therapeutic intervention. Fine-tuning of virus hemagglutinin binding to host-specific receptor repertoires needs to remain balanced to receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) activity and is a key step in host adaptation. It determines NA-dependent virus motility, enabling IAVs to traverse the mucus layer and to bind to, and migrate over, the epithelial cell surface for reaching a location supporting endocytic uptake. Canonical adaptations in enzootic/zoonotic IAVs enhancing human-type receptor binding are well-known, but the context and timespan required for their selection pose many questions. We discuss recent developments, focusing on the dynamic nature of interactions of IAV with the heterogeneous receptor repertoires present in humans and potential intermediate hosts. Potential pre-adaption toward human-type receptor binding in intermediate hosts will be discussed."

Here, we demonstrate how multimodal models that effectively leverage both structured and unstructured data can be developed for predicting COVID-19 outcomes. The models are trained end-to-end using a technique we refer to as multimodal fine-tuning, whereby a pre-trained language model is updated based on both structured and unstructured data. The multimodal models are trained and evaluated using a multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients encompassing all encounters at the emergency department of six hospitals. Experimental results show that multimodal models, leveraging the notion of multimodal fine-tuning and trained to predict (i) 30-day mortality, (ii) safe discharge and (iii) readmission, outperform unimodal models trained using only structured or unstructured healthcare data on all three outcomes. Sensitivity analyses are performed to better understand how well the multimodal models perform on different patient groups, while an ablation study is conducted to investigate the impact of different types of clinical notes on model performance. We argue that multimodal models that make effective use of routinely collected healthcare data to predict COVID-19 outcomes may facilitate patient management and contribute to the effective use of limited healthcare resources."

We carried out a search using the website research tool for the five most widely read Italian newspapers and an internet search on Google and Yahoo's Italian websites, to identify lethal cases of children left unintentionally in a parked motor vehicle. We identified eight deaths, occurring between 1998 and 2017 in Italy. All incidents occurred in the period between May and July when the mean daily external temperature was between 16 and 27.5 °C. Five girls and three boys between 11 and 24 months in age were involved, and in all cases the caregiver concerned was a parent. The Public Health community must vigorously promote research by auto manufacturers to develop technological solutions such as visual and audio warning systems aimed at reducing the possibility that a child be inadvertently left inside a parked vehicle."

Results of the included studies varied, ranging from significant positive to significant negative associations with thyroid cancer incidence for different PFAS. Meta-analyses of PFOA, Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) were not significant. This comprehensive review of the current literature highlights the limited knowledge and inconsistent results of this association. Large longitudinal cohort studies with varying time between sample collection and thyroid cancer diagnosis are needed to better understand the role of PFAS exposure on thyroid carcinogenesis."

RECENT FINDINGS: Lung-protective ventilation has become a pivotal component of perioperative care, aiming to enhance patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). High-quality research has established the benefits of strategies such as low tidal volume ventilation and low driving pressures. Debate is still ongoing on the most suitable levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the role of recruitment maneuvers. Adapting PEEP according to patient-specific factors offers potential benefits in maintaining ventilation distribution uniformity, especially in challenging scenarios like pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positions. Advanced monitoring systems, which continuously assess patient responses and enable the fine-tuning of ventilation parameters, offer real-time data analytics to predict and prevent impending lung complications. However, their impact on postoperative outcomes, particularly PPCs, is an ongoing area of research.
SUMMARY: Refining protective lung ventilation is crucial to provide patients with the best possible care during surgery, reduce the incidence of PPCs, and improve their overall surgical journey."

For people with epilepsy, social determinants of health are associated with disparities in access to care, but their impact on seizure outcomes among those with access to specialty care remains unclear. Here we (1) evaluated our validated, epilepsy-specific LLM for intrinsic bias, and (2) used LLM-extracted seizure outcomes to test the hypothesis that different demographic groups have different seizure outcomes.
METHODS: First, we tested our LLM for intrinsic bias in the form of differential performance in demographic groups by race, ethnicity, sex, income, and health insurance in manually annotated notes. Next, we used LLM-classified seizure freedom at each office visit to test for outcome disparities in the same demographic groups, using univariable and multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: We analyzed 84,675 clinic visits from 25,612 patients seen at our epilepsy center 2005-2022. We found no differences in the accuracy, or positive or negative class balance of outcome classifications across demographic groups. Multivariable analysis indicated worse seizure outcomes for female patients (OR 1.33, p = 3×10-8), those with public insurance (OR 1.53, p = 2×10-13), and those from lower-income zip codes (OR ≥ 1.22, p ≤ 6.6×10-3). Black patients had worse outcomes than White patients in univariable but not multivariable analysis (OR 1.03, p = 0.66).
SIGNIFICANCE: We found no evidence that our LLM was intrinsically biased against any demographic group. Seizure freedom extracted by LLM revealed disparities in seizure outcomes across several demographic groups. These findings highlight the critical need to reduce disparities in the care of people with epilepsy."

The genome of the virus's most common subtype, HTLV-1A, encodes structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins that contribute to viral persistence and pathogenesis. Among these is the p30 protein encoded by the doubly spliced Tax-orf II mRNA, a nuclear/nucleolar protein with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity. The p30 protein inhibits the productive replication cycle via nuclear retention of the mRNA that encodes for both the viral transcriptional trans-activator Tax, and the Rex proteins that regulate the transport of incompletely spliced viral mRNA to the cytoplasm. In myeloid cells, p30 inhibits the PU-1 transcription factor that regulates interferon expression and is a critical mediator of innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, p30 alters gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage responses in T-cells, raising the hypothesis that p30 may directly contribute to T cell transformation. By fine-tuning viral expression while also inhibiting host innate responses, p30 is likely essential for viral infection and persistence. This concept is supported by the finding that macaques, a natural host for the closely genetically related simian T-cell leukemia virus 1 (STLV-1), exposed to an HTLV-1 knockout for p30 expression by a single point mutation do not became infected unless reversion and selection of the wild type HTLV-1 genotype occurs. All together, these data suggest that inhibition of p30 may help to curb and eventually eradicate viral infection by exposing infected cells to an effective host immune response."

METHODS: We identified 275 individuals who developed ALS while enrolled in 5 US prospective cohorts, and randomly selected 2 controls, alive at the time of the case diagnosis, matched on cohort, birth year, sex, ethnicity, fasting status, and time of blood draw. We measured PUFA, expressed as percentages of total fatty acids, using gas liquid chromatography and used conditional logistic regression to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between PUFA and ALS.
RESULTS: There was no association between total, n-3, and n-6 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosapentaenoic acid levels and ALS. Higher plasma α-linolenic acid (ALA) in men was associated with lower risk of ALS in age- and matching factor-adjusted analyses (top vs bottom quartile: RR = 0.21 [95% CI 0.07, 0.58], p for trend = 0.004). In women, higher plasma arachidonic acid was associated with higher risk (top vs bottom quartile: RR = 1.65 [95% CI 0.99, 2.76], p for trend = 0.052). Multivariable adjustment, including correlated PUFA, did not change the findings for ALA and arachidonic acid. In men and women combined, higher plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was associated with higher risk of ALS (top vs bottom quartile: RR = 1.56 [95% CI 1.01, 2.41], p for trend = 0.054), but in multivariable models the association was only evident in men.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of individual PUFAs were not associated with ALS. In men, ALA was inversely and DHA was positively related to risk of ALS, while in women arachidonic acid was positively related. These findings warrant confirmation in future studies."

The industrial revolution has also intensified livestock farming, resulting in an increased demand for productivity and stressed animals. The livestock industry faces significant challenges from a projected sharp increase in global food and high animal protein demand. Nutrition genomics holds great promise for the future as its advances have opened up a whole new world of disease understanding and prevention. Nutrigenomics is the study of the interactions between genes and diet. It investigates molecular relationships between nutrients and genes to identify how even minor modifications could potentially alter animal and human health/performance by using techniques like proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. Dietary modifications mostly studied in livestock focus mainly on health and production traits through protein, fat, mineral, and vitamin supplementation changes. Nutrigenomics meticulously selects nutrients for fine-tuning the expression of genes that match animal/human genotypes for better health, productivity, and the environment. As a step forward, nutrigenomics integrates nutrition, molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular medicine, and epidemiology to better understand the role of food as an epigenetic factor in the occurrence of these diseases.

Epub 2019 Sep 26.,Liaw YF,Hepatol Int,2019,2019/09/28,,,10.1007/s12072-019-09989-6,"Potent nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUC), such as entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, are able to suppress HBV DNA to undetectable level. These agents have no direct action on cccDNA, which is a very stable template for HBV production, hence long-term or even life-long NUC therapy is required in HBeAg-negative patients to maintain HBV suppression and to achieve the ultimate goal of HBsAg loss. However, there are concerns of indefinite or life-long NUC therapy, including drug resistance, financial burden, adherence and willingness for indefinite long-term NUC therapy. Patients lost to follow-up and hence, not monitored may risk severe relapse that may deteriorate to hepatic decompensation or even hepatic failure. This Review integrated the cumulated evidence and assessed the strategy of finite NUC therapy in HBeAg-negative patients which was first tried in early 2000s. Earlier Asian findings that 2-year NUC therapy is feasible and safe have founded APASL stopping rule for patients on NUC therapy over 2-3 years since 2008. Subsequent studies have supported the strategy of finite NUC therapy, which has finally been accepted as an option by American and European liver associations since 2016. More recent studies have further shown greatly increased HBsAg loss rate (up to 5-year 39%) after stopping NUC therapy. The cumulated evidence has shown that the paradigm shift from indefinite long-term therapy to finite NUC therapy in HBeAg-negative patients is emerging. More studies are needed to fine-tuning the strategy including research for the optimal duration of consolidation therapy, timing to stop and to start re-treatment."

Although the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is the mainstay of chemotherapy, therapeutic resistance rapidly develops in patients. Base excision repair inhibitor TRC102 (methoxyamine) reverses TMZ resistance in preclinical glioma models. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral TRC102+TMZ in recurrent GBM (rGBM).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A preregistered (NCT02395692), nonrandomized, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial (BERT) was planned and conducted through the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC-1402). Arm 1 included patients with bevacizumab-naïve GBM at the first recurrence, with the primary endpoint of response rates. If sufficient activity was identified, a second arm was planned for the bevacizumab-refractory patients. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), PFS at 6 months (PFS6), and toxicity.
RESULTS: Arm 1 enrolled 19 patients with a median of two treatment cycles. Objective responses were not observed; hence, arm 2 did not open. The median OS was 11.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.2-17.9]. The median PFS was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.7). The PFS6 was 10.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-33.1%). Most toxicities were grades 1 and 2, with two grade 3 lymphopenias and one grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Two patients with PFS ≥ 17 months and OS > 32 months were deemed ""extended survivors."" RNA sequencing of tumor tissue, obtained at diagnosis, demonstrated significantly enriched signatures of DNA damage response (DDR), chromosomal instability (CIN70, CIN25), and cellular proliferation (PCNA25) in ""extended survivors.""
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the safety and feasibility of TRC102+TMZ in patients with rGBM. They also warrant further evaluation of combination therapy in biomarker-enriched trials enrolling GBM patients with baseline hyperactivated DDR pathways."

METHODS: A retrospective observational study in two tertiary centers in France was performed. Pregnant patients during the follow-up of a non-infectious uveitis as well as those with new-onset uveitis were included. The medical records were analyzed with a systematic collection of the characteristics of the uveitis, the treatment and evolution of the uveitis, and the course of the pregnancy including obstetric complications.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine pregnancies in 59 women were included: 48 patients (68 pregnancies) were followed for uveitis and 11 had a new-onset uveitis diagnosis. Most patients had idiopathic uveitis (32.2%) or sarcoid uveitis (27.1%). Among the patients followed for uveitis at the time of conception, there were 18 relapses (26.5%) requiring treatment escalation. Relapses occurred mainly in the two first trimester (n = 12) or during the postpartum period (n = 5) and were significantly associated with an active uveitis at the time of conception (OR = 9.2, 95% CI [1.57-48.4], p = 0.01). The characteristics of the new-onset uveitis were similar to those already existing before pregnancy. Obstetric complications occurred in 25 pregnancies (31.6%), mainly gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of non-infectious uveitis relapses decreases as pregnancy progresses, in agreement with data from other non-European studies. However, multidisciplinary monitoring should be advised, especially to uncontrolled patients at the time of conception."

METHODS: Review of medical literature and expert opinion were used in the development of this review.
RESULTS: There is undoubtedly a large clinical and public health burden associated with AMR in ICU, but it is challenging to quantify the associated excess morbidity and mortality. In the last decade, antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention and control have been unable to prevent the rapid spread of resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), in particular carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (and other non-fermenting GNB), extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). The situation appears more optimistic currently for Gram-positive, where Staphylococcus aureus, and particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), remains a cardinal cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Recent advancements in laboratory techniques allow for a rapid identification of the infecting pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Their impact can be particularly relevant in settings with prevalence of MDR, since they may guide fine-tuning of empirically selected regimen, facilitate de-escalation of unnecessary antimicrobials, and support infection control decisions. Currently, antibiotics are the primary anti-infective solution for patients with known or suspected MDR bacteria in intensive care. Numerous incentives have been provided to encourage researchers to work on alternative strategies to reverse this trend and to provide a means to treat these pathogens. Although some promising antibiotics currently in phase 2 and 3 of development will soon be licensed and utilized in ICU, the continuous development of an alternative generation of compounds is extremely important. There are currently several promising avenues available to fight antibiotic resistance, such as faecal microbiota, and phage therapy."

Epub 2022 Feb 11.,Thamm OC,Burns,2023,2022/03/02,,,10.1016/j.burns.2022.02.010,"BACKGROUND: From 1991-2014, all major burn centers of the German-speaking countries participated in a multicenter study in which essentially demographic data were collected. Individual patient data was located at the particular burn centers and only cumulated data were summarized annually for presentation. Retrospective statistical analysis of the entire data collection and identification of subgroups was not possible. In 2015 the German Burn Registry was established for prospective collection of individual patient data as a tool for quality management (QM) and for scientific analyses.
METHODS: A working group was formed to ensure the development and administration of the registry. From the official start of the German Burn Registry at the beginning of the year 2015 prospective data collection was realized with an individualized, web-based data collection software in a pseudonymized way. Selected data analysis was performed for the first 5 years of data collection. Severely burned adults and all hospitalized children with burn injuries were documented in the registry.
RESULTS: The German Burn Registry was successfully established. 64 burn divisions have already been registered. 18,891 patients were documented over 5 years, of which 58% where children (<16 years). Mean ABSI Score was 4 (children: 3, adults: 6) with a mortality rate of 3.8.0% (children: 0.2%, adults: 9.3%). Children were hospitalized for an average of 7 days, whereas adults were discharged after 18 days.
CONCLUSION: A registry is mandatory for quality assurance in burn medicine, since realization of randomized studies is difficult due to the heterogeneity of burn injuries. The German Burn Registry already is one of the biggest burn registries in Europe. Several scientific projects, based on the registry database, are in working process or have already been published."

METHODS: Information specific to each state program was identified from Internet resources including state pharmacy associations, licensing boards, and professional associations. Each state's site was evaluated for currency within 2016-2017. Direct contact by e-mail or telephone using the program information, or association, or licensing board contacts was pursued to identify the current program status.
RESULTS: Five states with no program in 1990 have since developed programs, and 2 states with programs in 1990 have closed their programs. Overall, 4 states do not currently have a program, 2 of which have never had one. One of the 2 states has recent authorization from their legislature to develop a program. Three other programs are currently in transition from 1 model to another, resulting in website inaccuracies. The operational models have undergone significant shifts with a decrease in the association (± [with or without] Foundation) model toward a group health care association or organization model including other health- or all state-licensed professionals.
CONCLUSION: Currently, 46 states have programs for assisting pharmacy professionals. Information presented in this article provides the most current contact information and model structure used by states with programs. Frequent updating of program information is critical for those who might decide to seek assistance. Expansion to include a central database that enables rigorous evaluation of outcomes and specific features is viewed as desirable."

Online ahead of print.,Liu M,Int Dent J,2024,2024/11/12,,,10.1016/j.identj.2024.10.014,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: This study systematically reviews and conducts a meta-analysis to evaluate the performance of various large language models (LLMs) in dental licensing examinations worldwide. The aim is to assess the accuracy of these models in different linguistic and geographical contexts. This will inform their potential application in dental education and diagnostics.
METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published from 1 January 2022 to 1 May 2024. Two authors independently reviewed the literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the studies in accordance with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. We conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the performance of LLMs.
RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing dental licensing examinations from eight countries. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard achieved integrated accuracy rates of 54%, 72%, and 56%, respectively. GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and Bard, passing more than half of the dental licensing examinations. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression showed that GPT-3.5 performed significantly better in English-speaking countries. GPT-4's performance, however, remained consistent across different regions.
CONCLUSION: LLMs, particularly GPT-4, show potential in dental education and diagnostics, yet their accuracy remains below the threshold required for clinical application. The lack of sufficient training data in dentistry has affected LLMs' accuracy. The reliance on image-based diagnostics also presents challenges. As a result, their accuracy in dental exams is lower compared to medical licensing exams. Additionally, LLMs even provide more detailed explanation for incorrect answer than correct one. Overall, the current LLMs are not yet suitable for use in dental education and clinical diagnosis."

METHODS: This prospective, observational study recruited patients up to 60 weeks' postmenstrual age undergoing anaesthesia for surgical or diagnostic procedures from 165 centres in 31 European countries between March 2016 and January 2017. The primary aim was to identify thresholds of pre-determined physiological variables that triggered a medical intervention. The secondary aims were to evaluate morbidities, mortality at 30 and 90 days, or both, and associations with critical events.
RESULTS: Infants (n=5609) born at mean (standard deviation [sd]) 36.2 (4.4) weeks postmenstrual age (35.7% preterm) underwent 6542 procedures within 63 (48) days of birth. Critical event(s) requiring intervention occurred in 35.2% of cases, mainly hypotension (&gt;30% decrease in blood pressure) or reduced oxygenation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;85%). Postmenstrual age influenced the incidence and thresholds for intervention. Risk of critical events was increased by prior neonatal medical conditions, congenital anomalies, or both (relative risk [RR]=1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.28) and in those requiring preoperative intensive support (RR=1.27; 95% CI, 1.15-1.41). Additional complications occurred in 16.3% of patients by 30 days, and overall 90-day mortality was 3.2% (95% CI, 2.7-3.7%). Co-occurrence of intraoperative hypotension, hypoxaemia, and anaemia was associated with increased risk of morbidity (RR=3.56; 95% CI, 1.64-7.71) and mortality (RR=19.80; 95% CI, 5.87-66.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Variability in physiological thresholds that triggered an intervention, and the impact of poor tissue oxygenation on patient's outcome, highlight the need for more standardised perioperative management guidelines for neonates and infants.

METHODS: We analyzed the agreement between Medicare claims for LLM and LLM use indicated by self-report during a telephone interview and, separately, by a medication inventory performed during an in-home study visit upon enrollment into the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. We included REGARDS participants ≥65 years enrolled in 2006-2007 with Medicare pharmacy benefits (Part D) from 120 days before their telephone interview through their medication inventory (n = 899).
RESULTS: Overall, 39.2% and 39.5% of participants had a Medicare claim for an LLM within 120 days prior to their interview and medication inventory, respectively. Also, 42.7% of participants self-reported using LLMs, and 41.8% had an LLM in their medication inventory. The Kappa statistic (95% confidence interval [CI]) for agreement of Medicare claims with self-report and medication inventory was 0.68 (0.63-0.73) and 0.72 (0.68-0.77), respectively. No Medicare claims for LLMs were present for 22.1% (95%CI: 18.1-26.6%) of participants who self-reported taking LLMs and 18.9% (15.1-23.3%) with LLMs in their medication inventory. Agreement between Medicare claims and self-report was lower among Black male individuals (Kappa = 0.34 [95%CI: 0.14-0.54]) compared with Black female individuals (0.70 [0.61-0.79]), White male individuals (0.65 [0.56-0.75]), and White female individuals (0.79 [0.72-0.86]). Agreement between Medicare claims and the medication inventory was also low among Black male individuals (Kappa = 0.48 [95%CI: 0.29-0.66]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although substantial agreement exists, many Medicare beneficiaries who self-report LLM use or have LLMs in a medication inventory have no claims for these medications. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

AIM: We aimed to analyse the characteristics of patients with sarcoidosis diagnosed after 75 and to compare them with those of younger patients.
DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study comparing elderly-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) with young-onset sarcoidosis (YOS) seen at Lyon University Hospitals between 2006 and 2018.
METHODS: Using our institutional database, we included 34 patients in the EOS group and compared them with 102 controls from the YOS group in a 1:3 ratio. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, sites of biopsies, histological analyses, treatments and outcomes were recorded using a comprehensive questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were more Caucasians in the EOS group (94.1% vs. 59.8%; P < 0.001), who had significantly more comorbidities (mean, 3.1 ± 2 vs. 1.1 ± 1.6; P < 0.001). In the EOS group, there was less pulmonary involvement (26.5% vs. 49%; P = 0.022), less lymphadenopathy (2.9% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.041), no erythema nodosum (0% vs. 12.8%; P = 0.029) and no arthralgia (0% vs. 25.5%; P = 0.001). Conversely, uveitis was more common in the EOS group (55.9% vs. 20.6%; P < 0.001). Pathological confirmation was obtained significantly less frequently in the EOS group (67.7% vs. 85.3%; P = 0.023). Corticosteroid-related side effects were significantly more common in the EOS group (100% vs. 75.9%; P = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Epidemiology and clinical presentation of EOS differs from YOS, including more comorbidities and more uveitis. Elderly patients are more prone to corticosteroid side effects."

Within 2 months after its description, the disease has reached epidemic proportion, affecting over 2000 people and resulting in a number of fatalities. The substance(s) responsible for the lung injury are still unknown, and the pathophysiology of the disease is still incompletely understood. The manifestations of the disease are protean, and the insidiously starting respiratory, gastrointestinal, and constitutional symptoms may initially resemble a viral flu-like illness. The disease may increase in severity, requiring hospitalization, and in more severe cases, mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis of VAPI currently relies on the identification of pulmonary infiltrates on imaging studies in patients who have used vaping products, after excluding infections and other plausible alternative diagnoses. Because VAPI is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, some authors have suggested the use of lipid-laden macrophages (LLM) as a diagnostic test to confirm the disease. We review the current state of the knowledge about the pathologic basis of VAPI, and the literature on the analytic performance of the LLM test to better understand the potential utility of this test in the diagnosis of VAPI. Our review finds little evidence to suggest the use of LLM in the diagnosis of VAPI, since its underlying pathology is acute lung injury, which is unrelated to LLM, and the frequency of their detection varies greatly in different reported series."

Changes in autophagy are indeed correlated with several pathological disorders such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, infections, cancer and inflammatory diseases. Conversely, autophagy controls both apoptosis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the cells. Therefore, any changes in the autophagy pathway will affect both the UPR and apoptosis. Recent evidence has shown that several natural products can modulate (induce or inhibit) the autophagy pathway. Natural products may target different regulatory components of the autophagy pathway, including specific kinases or phosphatases. In this review, we evaluated ~100 natural compounds and plant species and their impact on different types of cancers via the autophagy pathway. We also discuss the impact of these compounds on the UPR and apoptosis via the autophagy pathway. A multitude of preclinical findings have shown the function of botanicals in regulating cell autophagy and its potential impact on cancer therapy; however, the number of related clinical trials to date remains low. In this regard, further pre-clinical and clinical studies are warranted to better clarify the utility of natural compounds and their modulatory effects on autophagy, as fine-tuning of autophagy could be translated into therapeutic applications for several cancers."

However, whether high serum uric acid (sUA) is a causative factor or just comorbidity remains unclear. When asked if asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients need treatment, even artificial intelligence in the form of the GPT chat provides an ambivalent answer and refers us to a healthcare provider. We believe that such discrepancies stem from an incomplete understanding of the role that uric acid (UA) plays inside and outside the cell. With the rapid development of genomics, proteomics, immunology, and novel biomarkers, we are armed with new data to help us better understand the weight of inborn and environmental factors on an individual's UA concentrations. This review sums up the latest progress that has been made in the field of asymptomatic HU, compares the results presented by various research teams, and indicates new directions that emerge for future studies."

Epub 2022 Dec 1.,Avau B,Vox Sang,2023,2022/12/01,PMC10107266,,10.1111/vox.13387,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Platelet transfusions are used across multiple patient populations to prevent and correct bleeding. This scoping review aimed to map the currently available systematic reviews (SRs) and evidence-based guidelines in the field of platelet transfusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in seven databases for SRs on effectiveness (including dose and timing, transfusion trigger and ratio to other blood products), production modalities and decision support related to platelet transfusion. The following data were charted: methodological features of the SR, population, concept and context features, outcomes reported, study design and number of studies included. Results were synthesized in interactive evidence maps.
RESULTS: We identified 110 SRs. The majority focused on clinical effectiveness, including prophylactic or therapeutic transfusions compared to no platelet transfusion (34 SRs), prophylactic compared to therapeutic-only transfusion (8 SRs), dose, timing (11 SRs) and threshold for platelet transfusion (15 SRs) and the ratio of platelet transfusion to other blood products in massive transfusion (14 SRs). Furthermore, we included 34 SRs on decision support, of which 26 evaluated viscoelastic testing. Finally, we identified 22 SRs on platelet production modalities, including derivation (4 SRs), pathogen inactivation (6 SRs), leucodepletion (4 SRs) and ABO/human leucocyte antigen matching (5 SRs). The SRs were mapped according to concept and clinical context.
CONCLUSION: An interactive evidence map of SRs and evidence-based guidelines in the field of platelet transfusion has been developed and identified multiple reviews. This work serves as a tool for researchers looking for evidence gaps, thereby both supporting research and avoiding unnecessary duplication."

We evaluated weight change with cutpoints of low lean mass (LLM) in older adults.
METHODS: Of 4984 subjects ≥60 years from NHANES 1999-2004, we applied LLM cutoffs of appendicular lean mass (ALM):body mass index (BMI) males<0.789, females<0.512. Self-reported weight was assessed at time of survey, and questions asked participants their weight one and 10 years earlier, and at age 25. Weight changes were categorized as greater/less/none than 5%. Logistic regression assessed weight change (gain, loss, no change) on LLM, after adjustment.
RESULTS: Of 4984 participants (56.5% female), mean age and BMI were 71.1 years and 28.2 kg/m2. Mean ALM was 19.7 kg. In those with LLM, 13.5% and 16.3% gained/lost weight in the past year, while 48.9% and 19.4% gained/lost weight in the past decade. Compared to weight at age 25, 85.2 and 6.1% of LLM participants gained and lost ≥5% of their weight, respectively. Weight gain over the past year was associated with a higher risk of LLM (OR 1.35 [0.99,1.87]) compared to weight loss ≥5% over the past year (0.89 [0.70,1.12]). Weight gain (≥5%) over 10-years was associated with a higher risk of LLM (OR 2.03 [1.66, 2.49]) while weight loss (≥5%) was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.98 [0.76,1.28]). Results were robust compared to weight at 25 years (gain OR 2.37 [1.76,3.20]; loss OR 0.95 [0.65,1.39]).
CONCLUSION: Self-reported weight gain suggests an increased risk of LLM. Future studies need to verify the relationship with physical function."

International literature reveals no consensus on which and how many characteristics and risk indicators must be present to diagnose (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The aim of this survey was to reach consensus among a panel of clinical medical experts in geriatrics and pulmonology about the characteristics required for diagnosing pneumonia, and about the risk indicators needed to consider the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
METHODS: Literature review and three expert-rating iterations using the electronically-modified Delphi Method were carried out. After each expert rating iteration, data analysis was performed. Qualitative responses and additional (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia characteristics which were mentioned in reply to structured open-ended questions were summarised, whilst similar responses were combined and these combinations were ordered by frequency in order to use them in the next iteration. Characteristics which failed to reach consensus were considered as inconclusive and eliminated. Consensus was reached when at least 70 % of the participants agreed.
RESULTS: Literature review revealed 16 currently used common characteristics for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. No consensus was reached about characteristics and the number of characteristics required for diagnosing (nursing home-acquired) pneumonia. However, 57 % agreed that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are the most important characteristics and the responses by the participants suggested that two or three characteristics should be present. Subsequently, 80 % of the participants agreed on the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment for considering the diagnosis aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: No final consensus could be reached about which and how many characteristics are required for diagnosing pneumonia in nursing home residents. However, the results indicated that dyspnea, fever, deterioration of general functioning, tachypnea and crepitation with auscultation are characteristics of some importance and that at least two or three characteristics should be present. With regard to considering aspiration pneumonia in nursing home residents with pneumonia, final consensus was reached about the risk indicators dysphagia, choking incident, (history of) tube feeding, neurological disease and cognitive impairment."

The establishment of a FH registry could facilitate a deeper understanding of this disease. We described the clinical characteristics of subjects with FH from the Thai FH Registry, compared our data with the regional and global data, and identified gaps in the care of these subjects.
METHODS: A multicenter, nationwide prospective FH registry was established in Thailand. Our data were compared with those of the European Atherosclerosis Society-FH Studies Collaboration. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for variables associated with lipid-lowering medication (LLM) use and the attainment of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal.
RESULTS: The study includes 472 subjects with FH (mean age at FH diagnosis: 46±12 years, 61.4% women). A history of premature coronary artery disease was found in 12%. The percentage of LLM use in subjects with a Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score of ≥ 6 (probable or definite FH) in our registry (64%) was slightly lower than the regional data but higher than the global data. Among those who received statins, 25.2% and 6.4% achieved LDL-C levels of ＜100 mg/dL and ＜70 mg/dL, respectively. Women with FH were less likely to achieve LDL-C ＜70 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio: 0.22, 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.71, p=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: FH in Thailand was diagnosed late, and treatment was inadequate for the majority of subjects. Women with FH were less likely to achieve LDL-C goals. Our insights could potentially help raise awareness and narrow the gap in patient care."

We evaluated the ability of three large language models (LLMs) (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Google Bard) to generate novel patient education materials (PEMs) and improve the readability of existing PEMs on paediatric cataract.
METHODS: We compared LLMs' responses to three prompts. Prompt A requested they write a handout on paediatric cataract that was 'easily understandable by an average American.' Prompt B modified prompt A and requested the handout be written at a 'sixth-grade reading level, using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability formula.' Prompt C rewrote existing PEMs on paediatric cataract 'to a sixth-grade reading level using the SMOG readability formula'. Responses were compared on their quality (DISCERN; 1 (low quality) to 5 (high quality)), understandability and actionability (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (≥70%: understandable, ≥70%: actionable)), accuracy (Likert misinformation; 1 (no misinformation) to 5 (high misinformation) and readability (SMOG, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL); grade level <7: highly readable).
RESULTS: All LLM-generated responses were of high-quality (median DISCERN ≥4), understandability (≥70%), and accuracy (Likert=1). All LLM-generated responses were not actionable (<70%). ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 prompt B responses were more readable than prompt A responses (p<0.001). ChatGPT-4 generated more readable responses (lower SMOG and FKGL scores; 5.59±0.5 and 4.31±0.7, respectively) than the other two LLMs (p<0.001) and consistently rewrote them to or below the specified sixth-grade reading level (SMOG: 5.14±0.3).
CONCLUSION: LLMs, particularly ChatGPT-4, proved valuable in generating high-quality, readable, accurate PEMs and in improving the readability of existing materials on paediatric cataract."

There are several methods to assess trial outcomes beyond time-to-first-event analysis, such as analyzing total events and ranking outcomes. In the GLOBAL LEADERS study, time-to-first-event analysis did not show superiority of ticagrelor monotherapy following one-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention to conventional 12-month DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy in the reduction of the primary composite end point of all-cause mortality or new Q-wave myocardial infarction. This study sought to explore various analytical approaches in assessing total ischemic and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary intervention in the GLOBAL LEADERS study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Total ischemic and bleeding events were defined as all-cause mortality, any stroke, any myocardial infarction, any revascularization, or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grade 2 or 3 bleeding. We used various analytical approaches to analyze the benefit of ticagrelor monotherapy over conventional DAPT. For ischemic and bleeding events at 2 years after percutaneous coronary intervention, ticagrelor monotherapy demonstrated a 6% risk reduction, compared with conventional 12-month DAPT in time-to-first-event analysis (hazard ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-1.01]; log-rank P=0.10). In win ratio analysis, win ratio was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.97-1.13; P=0.20). Negative binomial regression and Andersen-Gill analyses which include repeated events showed statistically significant advantage for ticagrelor monotherapy (rate ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99; P=0.020] and hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99; P=0.028], respectively), although in weighted composite end point analysis, the hazard ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-1.04; log-rank P=0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analyses considering repeated events or event severity showed that ticagrelor monotherapy consistently reduced ischemic and bleeding events by 5% to 8%, compared with conventional 1-year DAPT. Applying multiple statistical methods could emphasize the multiple facets of a trial and result in accurate and more appropriate analyses. Considering the recurrence of ischemic and bleeding events, ticagrelor monotherapy appeared to be beneficial after percutaneous coronary intervention.

However, the ideal patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be well-defined. Moreover, biologic therapy has disadvantages, such as high costs and limited access. The proposal of a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm offers an intriguing solution for optimizing decision-making protocols.
METHODS: The AI algorithm was initially programmed to conduct a systematic literature review searching for the current primary guidelines on biologics' clinical efficacy and safety in treating CRSwNP. The review included a total of 12 studies: 6 systematic reviews, 4 expert consensus guidelines, and 2 surveys. Simultaneously, two independent human researchers conducted a literature search to compare the results. Subsequently, the AI was tasked to critically analyze the identified papers, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, thereby creating a decision-making algorithm and pyramid flow chart.
RESULTS: The studies evaluated various biologics, including monoclonal antibodies targeting Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-4, IL-13, and Immunoglobulin E (IgE), assessing their effectiveness in different patient populations, such as those with comorbid asthma or refractory CRSwNP. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit, demonstrated significant improvement in nasal symptoms and quality of life in patients with CRSwNP in several randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Similarly, mepolizumab and reslizumab, which target IL-5, have also shown efficacy in reducing nasal polyp burden and improving symptoms in patients with CRSwNP, particularly those with comorbid asthma. However, additional studies are required to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of these biologics in treating CRSwNP.
CONCLUSIONS: Biologic therapies have surfaced as a promising treatment option for patients with severe or refractory CRSwNP; however, the optimal patient population, dosage, and treatment duration are yet to be defined. The application of AI in decision-making protocols and the creation of therapeutic algorithms for biologic drug selection, could offer fascinating future prospects in the management of CRSwNP."

METHODS: The CREACTIVE observational study enrolled more than 8000 patients from 83 ICUs. Adult TBI patients admitted to no-NSH ICUs within 48 h of trauma were propensity-score matched 1:3 with patients admitted to NSH ICUs. The primary outcome was the 6-month extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), while secondary outcomes were ICU and hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 232 patients, less than 5% of the eligible cohort, were admitted to no-NSH ICUs. Each of them was matched to 3 NSH patients, leading to a study sample of 928 TBI patients where the no-NSH and NSH groups were well-balanced with respect to all of the variables included into the propensity score. Patients admitted to no-NSH ICUs experienced significantly higher ICU and in-hospital mortality. Compared to the matched NSH ICU admissions, their 6-month GOS-E scores showed a significantly higher prevalence of upper good recovery for cases with mild TBI and low expected mortality risk at admission, along with a progressively higher incidence of poor outcomes with increased TBI severity and mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, centralization of TBI patients significantly impacted short- and long-term outcomes. For TBI patients admitted to no-NSH centers, our results suggest that the least critically ill can effectively be managed in centers without neurosurgical capabilities. Conversely, the most complex patients would benefit from being treated in high-volume, neuro-oriented ICUs."

Current systems, like those run by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the National Toxicology Program (NTP), face challenges due to manual vetting and disparities in carcinogen classification spurred by the volume of emerging data. To address these issues, we introduced the Carcinogen Detection via Transformers (CarD-T) framework, a text analytics approach that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic statistical analysis to efficiently nominate carcinogens from scientific texts. CarD-T uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) trained on PubMed abstracts featuring known carcinogens from IARC groups and includes a context classifier to enhance accuracy and manage computational demands. Using this method, journal publication data indexed with carcinogenicity & carcinogenesis Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms from the last 25 years was analyzed, identifying potential carcinogens. Training CarD-T on 60% of established carcinogens (Group 1 and 2A carcinogens, IARC designation), CarD-T correctly to identifies all of the remaining Group 1 and 2A designated carcinogens from the analyzed text. In addition, CarD-T nominates roughly 1500 more entities as potential carcinogens that have at least two publications citing evidence of carcinogenicity. Comparative assessment of CarD-T against GPT-4 model reveals a high recall (0.857 vs 0.705) and F1 score (0.875 vs 0.792), and comparable precision (0.894 vs 0.903). Additionally, CarD-T highlights 554 entities that show disputing evidence for carcinogenicity. These are further analyzed using Bayesian temporal Probabilistic Carcinogenic Denomination (PCarD) to provide probabilistic evaluations of their carcinogenic status based on evolving evidence. Our findings underscore that the CarD-T framework is not only robust and effective in identifying and nominating potential carcinogens within vast biomedical literature but also efficient on consumer GPUs. This integration of advanced NLP capabilities with vital epidemiological analysis significantly enhances the agility of public health responses to carcinogen identification, thereby setting a new benchmark for automated, scalable toxicological investigations."

Manual literature curation of biological pathways is useful but cannot keep up with the exponential growth of the literature. Large-scale language models (LLMs), notable for their vast parameter sizes and comprehensive training on extensive text corpora, have great potential in automated text mining of biological pathways.
METHOD: This study assesses the effectiveness of 21 LLMs, including both API-based models and open-source models. The evaluation focused on two key aspects: gene regulatory relations (specifically, 'activation', 'inhibition', and 'phosphorylation') and KEGG pathway component recognition. The performance of these models was analyzed using statistical metrics such as precision, recall, F1 scores, and the Jaccard similarity index.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a significant disparity in model performance. Among the API-based models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-Pro showed superior performance, with an F1 score of 0.4448 and 0.4386 for the gene regulatory relation prediction, and a Jaccard similarity index of 0.2778 and 0.2657 for the KEGG pathway prediction, respectively. Open-source models lagged their API-based counterparts, where Falcon-180b-chat and llama1-7b led with the highest performance in gene regulatory relations (F1 of 0.2787 and 0.1923, respectively) and KEGG pathway recognition (Jaccard similarity index of 0.2237 and 0. 2207, respectively).
CONCLUSION: LLMs are valuable in biomedical research, especially in gene network analysis and pathway mapping. However, their effectiveness varies, necessitating careful model selection. This work also provided a case study and insight into using LLMs as knowledge graphs."

Furthermore, it plays a critical role in the regulation of RNA degradation by primarily recruiting the YTHDF2 reader protein. However, the selective regulation of mRNA decay of the m6A-methylated mRNA through YTHDF2 binding is poorly understood. To improve our understanding, we developed m6A-BERT-Deg, a BERT model adapted for predicting YTHDF2-mediated degradation of m6A-methylated mRNAs. We meticulously assembled a high-quality training dataset by integrating multiple data sources for the HeLa cell line. To overcome the limitation of small training samples, we employed a pre-training-fine-tuning strategy by first performing a self-supervised pre-training of the model on 427,760 unlabeled m6A site sequences. The test results demonstrated the importance of this pre-training strategy in enabling m6A-BERT-Deg to outperform other benchmark models. We further conducted a comprehensive model interpretation and revealed a surprising finding that the presence of co-factors in proximity to m6A sites may disrupt YTHDF2-mediated mRNA degradation, subsequently enhancing mRNA stability.

Epub 2021 Jul 8.,Avau B,Pharmacoeconomics,2021,2021/07/08,PMC8476458,,10.1007/s40273-021-01044-3,"OBJECTIVES: For anaemic elective surgery patients, current clinical practice guidelines weakly recommend the routine use of iron, but not erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs), except for short-acting ESAs in major orthopaedic surgery. This recommendation is, however, not based on any cost-effectiveness studies. The aim of this research was to (1) systematically review the literature regarding cost effectiveness of preoperative iron and/or ESAs in anaemic, elective surgery patients and (2) update existing economic evaluations (EEs) with recent data.
METHODS: Eight databases and registries were searched for EEs and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting cost-effectiveness data on November 11, 2020. Data were extracted, narratively synthesized and critically appraised using the Philips reporting checklist. Pre-existing full EEs were updated with effectiveness data from a recent systematic review and current cost data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed as cost per (quality-adjusted) life-year [(QA)LY] gained.
RESULTS: Only five studies (4 EEs and 1 RCT) were included, one on intravenous iron and four on ESAs + oral iron. The EE on intravenous iron only had an in-hospital time horizon. Therefore, cost effectiveness of preoperative iron remains uncertain. The three EEs on ESAs had a lifetime time horizon, but reported cost per (QA)LY gained of 20-65 million (GBP or CAD). Updating these analyses with current data confirmed ESAs to have a cost per (QA)LY gained of 3.5-120 million (GBP or CAD).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost effectiveness of preoperative iron is unproven, whereas routine preoperative ESA therapy cannot be considered cost effective in elective surgery, based on the limited available data. Future guidelines should reflect these findings."

This article aimed to present the Consensus of Ukrainian experts devoted to VDD management. Following the creation of the multidisciplinary Consensus group, consent on the formation process, drafting and fine-tuning of key recommendations, and two rounds of voting, 14 final recommendations were successfully voted upon. Despite a recent decrease in VDD prevalence in Ukraine, we recommend raising awareness regarding VDD's importance and improving the strategies for its decline. We recommend screening the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in risk groups while maintaining a target concentration of 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL). We recommend prophylactic cholecalciferol supplementation (800-2000 IU/d for youthful healthy subjects, and 3000-5000 IU/d for subjects from the risk groups). For a VDD treatment, we recommend a short-term administration of increased doses of cholecalciferol (4000-10,000 IU/d) with 25(OH)D levels monitored after 4-12 weeks of treatment, followed by the use of maintenance doses. Additionally, we recommend assessing serum 25(OH)D levels before antiosteoporotic treatment and providing vitamin D and calcium supplementation throughout the full course of the antiosteoporotic therapy."

This study aims to assess factors associated with perceived stress in Italian MSs. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 Italian medical schools (MSCs) in November 2018. A questionnaire assessed socio-demographic characteristics, habits, opinions about MSC, and concerns about the future. Stress was assessed with the PSS-10. Descriptive and univariable tests were performed. A linear model was fitted to find associations of the PSS-10 score with characteristics. There were 2513 collected questionnaires. Median PSS-10 score was 18 (IQR 11). Median age was 22 (IQR 4) and 61% of the sample was female. Female gender, being part of a sexual minority, poor financial situation, competitive atmosphere, having hobbies, resting, and sleeping hindered by MSC were characteristics associated with higher PSS-10 scores. Current relationship, good family relationship, and no concerns about the future were protective factors. Being part of sexual minorities had greater effects in students not living away from home, while in the other group it was not having satisfying friendships. Medical students suffer higher levels of stress than the general population, and many MSC stressors are associated. Living away from home modifies risk and protective factors, offering the possibility to tailor group-specific interventions."

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a realist review, which involved searching multiple sources (eg, databases, experts) to determine what about guideline implementability works, for whom, and under what circumstances. Two sets of reviewers independently screened abstracts and extracted data from 278 included studies. Analysis involved the development of a codebook of definitions, validation of data, and development of hierarchical narratives to explain guideline implementability.
RESULTS: We found that guideline implementability is associated with two broad goals in guideline development: (1) creation of guideline content, which involves addressing the domains of stakeholder involvement in CPGs, evidence synthesis, considered judgment (eg, clinical applicability), and implementation feasibility and (2) the effective communication of this content, which involves domains related to fine-tuning the CPG's message (using simple, clear, and persuasive language) and format.
CONCLUSION: Our work represents a comprehensive and interdisciplinary effort toward better understanding, which attributes of guidelines have the potential to improve uptake in clinical practice. We also created codebooks and narratives of key concepts, which can be used to create tools for developing better guidelines to promote better care."

However, septic surgical and trauma patients are unique in that they incur two or more inflammatory insults. The effects of advanced age on sepsis pathophysiology and outcomes remain unclear.
METHODS: We performed a single-center, prospective observational cohort study of surgical intensive care unit patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. Peripheral blood was collected for genomic, cytokine, and biomarker analysis at 0.5 day, 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days after sepsis onset. Based on sensitivity analysis, cohorts were defined as ""young"" (<55 years) and ""aged"" (≥55 years). We compared age-defined cohorts to determine differences in patient characteristics, biomarker profiles, and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The cohort included 173 patients with severe sepsis (n = 93; 53.8%) or septic shock (n = 80; 46.2%), with a mean age of 60.9 (±14.5) years. Intra-abdominal sepsis was the leading source (n = 81; 46.8%), followed by necrotizing soft tissue infection (n = 33, 19.1%) and pneumonia (n = 30; 17.3%). Aged patients had a higher comorbidity burden, but were otherwise similar to the young cohort. The aged cohort had a higher severity of early physiologic derangement (median APACHE II, 23 vs. 18; p = 0.002), greater incidence of multiple organ failure (64.3% vs. 40.4%, p = 0.006), and hospital mortality (15.9% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.016). Six-month mortality was significantly higher in the aged cohort as compared with young cohort (31% vs. 9%; p = 0.003). Aged septic patients biomarker trajectories suggestive of persistent immunosuppression (absolute lymphocyte count, soluble programed death ligand-1) and catabolism (Urine 3MH-Cr ratio, insulin growth factor, IGF1BP3, albumin) out to 28 days after sepsis.
CONCLUSION: Aged, critically ill surgical patients have greater organ dysfunction and incidence of adverse clinical outcomes after sepsis. Biomarker profiles suggest an immunophenotype of persistent immunosuppression and catabolism. Advanced age may necessitate novel therapeutic strategies to promote multisystem organ recovery and improve survival after sepsis.

Clinical data, particularly the laboratory tests for liver function, were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the survivor and non-survivor groups.Compared to survivors, non-survivors had significantly higher total bilirubin (TBIL), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at the terminal point of this study (P <.05). In addition, the peak values of TBIL, GPT, and longer APTT were higher in non-survivors than in survivors during hospital course, and the peak values of TBIL was one of major prognostic factors for mortality risk. Furthermore, at the first 2 weeks, the cumulative survival rates were significantly lower in patients with liver dysfunction than those without liver dysfunction (P <.01).Our findings show that the great changes in liver function occurred in first 2 weeks after severe burns. Liver dysfunction may have an effect on clinical outcomes of post-burn. Measures to protect liver function and prevent from deterioration could be beneficial in improvement survival rate, especially during the first 2 weeks."

Four major areas of supportive care can enhance responsiveness to cancer immunotherapy whilst minimizing adverse effects: diet (indirectly, by modulating the microbiota or directly, by modulating the immune system), physical activity (by modulating the immune system), electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) (by detecting and treating immune-related adverse events early on), and co-medication management (to possibly suppress those drugs that negatively affect the efficacy of ICIs). Therefore, patients treated with ICIs could receive a systematic multimodal supportive care program encompassing regular nutritional counseling, regular physical activity under the supervision of a physical activity professional, ePRO follow-up, and regular pharmaceutical counseling. This type of approach needs to be evaluated in well-conducted randomized clinical trials."

This systematic review assesses AAN literature from 2007 to 2020, to investigate: (a) the demographic characteristics of AAN studies, (b) the prevalence of AAN compared with AN, (c) the range of operational definitions of AAN and the implications of these definitions, and (d) the proportion of patients with AAN and AN represented in consecutive admission and referral samples.
METHOD: PsychINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, Greylit.org, and ProQuest databases were searched according to methods for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic reviews, yielding 3,184 potential articles. Seventy-five eligible studies were coded for sixty-one variables.
RESULTS: Clinical samples predominantly included younger, female, white samples with limited diversity. In epidemiological designs, AAN was typically as common or more common than AN, and AAN rates varied significantly based on the population studied and operational definitions. In consecutive clinical samples, AAN was frequently less represented.
DISCUSSION: Although AAN appears to occur more frequently than AN in communities, fewer patients with AAN are being referred and admitted to eating disorder specific care, particularly in the United States. Given the significant medical and psychosocial consequences of AAN, and the importance of early intervention, this represents a crucial treatment gap. Additionally, results suggest the need for fine-tuning diagnostic definitions, greater diversity in AAN studies, and increased screening and referral for this vulnerable population."

Trained on extensive data sources, including open-access publications, peer-reviewed research articles and biomedical websites, ChatGPT extracted information on gene relationships and biological pathways. However, a major challenge is model hallucination, i.e., high false positive rates. To assess and address this challenge, we systematically evaluated ChatGPT's capacity for predicting gene relationships using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Benchmarking against the KEGG Pathway Database as the ground truth, we experimented with diverse prompting strategies, targeting gene relationships of activation, inhibition, and phosphorylation. We introduced an innovative iterative prompt refinement technique. By assessing prompt efficacy using metrics like F-1 score, precision, and recall, GPT-4 was re-engaged to suggest improved prompts. A refined prompt, which combines a specialized role with explanatory text, significantly enhances the performance. Going beyond pairwise gene relationships, we also deciphered complex gene interplays, such as gene interaction chains and pathways pertinent to diseases like non-small cell lung cancer. Direct prompts showed limited success, but ""least-to-most"" prompting exhibited significant potentials for such network constructions. The methods in this study may be used for some other bioinformatics prediction problems."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is ideally suited for those analyses; however, conventional TEM protocols are not satisfactory for cysts of free-living protozoa. Here we report on the design and testing of four protocols for TEM sample preparation of cysts. Two protocols, one based on chemical fixation in coated well plates and one on high-pressure freezing, were selected as the most effective for TEM-based ultrastructural studies of cysts. Our protocols will enable improved analysis of cyst structure and a better understanding of bacterial survival mechanisms in cysts."

Epub 2017 Mar 29.,Wykrzykowska JJ,N Engl J Med,2017,2017/04/13,,,10.1056/NEJMoa1614954,"BACKGROUND: Bioresorbable vascular scaffolds were developed to overcome the shortcomings of drug-eluting stents in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We performed an investigator-initiated, randomized trial to compare an everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffold with an everolimus-eluting metallic stent in the context of routine clinical practice.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 1845 patients undergoing PCI to receive either a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (924 patients) or a metallic stent (921 patients). The primary end point was target-vessel failure (a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early reporting of the study results because of safety concerns. This report provides descriptive information on end-point events.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 707 days. Target-vessel failure occurred in 105 patients in the scaffold group and in 94 patients in the stent group (2-year cumulative event rates, 11.7% and 10.7%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.48; P=0.43); event rates were based on Kaplan-Meier estimates in time-to-event analyses. Cardiac death occurred in 18 patients in the scaffold group and in 23 patients in the stent group (2-year cumulative event rates, 2.0% and 2.7%, respectively), target-vessel myocardial infarction occurred in 48 patients in the scaffold group and in 30 patients in the stent group (2-year cumulative event rates, 5.5% and 3.2%), and target-vessel revascularization occurred in 76 patients in the scaffold group and in 65 patients in the stent group (2-year cumulative event rates, 8.7% and 7.5%). Definite or probable device thrombosis occurred in 31 patients in the scaffold group as compared with 8 patients in the stent group (2-year cumulative event rates, 3.5% vs. 0.9%; hazard ratio, 3.87; 95% CI, 1.78 to 8.42; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary report of a trial involving patients undergoing PCI, there was no significant difference in the rate of target-vessel failure between the patients who received a bioresorbable scaffold and the patients who received a metallic stent. The bioresorbable scaffold was associated with a higher incidence of device thrombosis than the metallic stent through 2 years of follow-up.

Novel genetic engineering and genome editing tools have accelerated the study of BSR genes and engineering of BSR in crops, and this area represents the primary focus of this review. We first summarize recent advances in the understanding of the plant immune system. We then examine progress in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying BSR in crops. Finally, we highlight diverse strategies employed to achieve BSR, such as gene stacking to combine multiple R genes, multiplexed genome editing of susceptibility (S) genes and promoters of executor R genes, editing cis-regulatory elements for fine-tuning gene expression, RNA interference, saturation mutagenesis, and precise genomic insertions. Genetic studies and engineering of BSR accelerate breeding of disease-resistant cultivars and crop improvement, which will act to safeguard global food security."

Several generations of PE have been developed based on an editor machine or prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to achieve any kind of genetic correction. However, due to the early stage of development, PE complex elements need to be optimized for more efficient editing. Smart optimization of editor proteins as well as pegRNA has been contemplated by many researchers, but the universal PE machine's current shortcomings remain to be solved. The modification of PE elements, fine-tuning of the host genes, manipulation of epigenetics, and blockage of immune responses could be used to reach more efficient PE. Moreover, the host factors involved in the PE process, such as repair and innate immune system genes, have not been determined, and PE cell context dependency is still poorly understood. Regarding the large size of the PE elements, delivery is a significant challenge and the development of a universal viral or nonviral platform is still far from complete. PE versions with shortened variants of reverse transcriptase are still too large to fit in common viral vectors. Overall, PE faces challenges in optimization for efficiency, high context dependency during the cell cycling, and delivery due to the large size of elements. In addition, immune responses, unpredictability of outcomes, and off-target effects further limit its application, making it essential to address these issues for broader use in nonpersonalized gene editing. Besides, due to the limited number of suitable animal models and computational modeling, the prediction of the PE process remains challenging. In this review, the fundamentals of PE, including generations, potential, optimization, delivery, in vivo barriers, and the future landscape of the technology are discussed."

However, the lack of studies describing the impact of these diseases on the outcome of very old subjects makes it difficult to appreciate their real clinical burden.
METHODS: Prospective, observational, population-based cohort study in Belgium. Five hundred fifty six subjects aged 80 years and older were followed up for 5.1 ± 0.25 years for mortality and 3.0 ± 0.25 years for hospitalization. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) was calculated for each subject.
RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate-to-severe VHD was 17% (n = 97). Mitral stenosis was more prevalent in women and an age-dependent increase of the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis was seen. The overall disease burden was higher in participants with VHD (median CIRS 3 [IQR 3-5] vs 4 [IQR 3-6] (P = 0.008)). Moderate-to-severe VHD, and more specifically mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis, was found to be an independent predictor of both all-cause (HR 1.42 (95% CI 1.04-1.95)) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.13 (95% CI 1.38-3.29)). Moderate-to-severe VHD was also found to be an independent predictor of the need for a first unplanned hospitalization (HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.06-1.94)).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of moderate-to-severe VHD was found in the very old. Moderate-to-severe VHD was identified as an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and as well for unplanned hospitalizations, independent of other structural cardiac abnormalities, ventricular function and major co-morbidities."

Observational real world data pre-post study included 9966 men aged &gt;16 years registered as having the diagnosis of alcohol abuse disorder in the electronic medical records (EMR) of the Aragon Regional Health Service (Spain). Clinical (Glutamate-oxaloacetate -GOT-, Glutamate pyruvate -GPT-, creatinine, glomerular filtration, systolic blood pressure -SBP-, diastolic blood pressure -DBP-, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and body mass index -BMI-), pharmacological (dose per inhabitant per day, DHD, of drugs used in addictive disorders, benzodiazepines and antidepressants) and health resource use variables (primary and specialized care) were considered. A Student's t-test for matched samples was performed to analyze the changes in clinical variables between alcohol abuse disorder patients with and without COVID-19. Only creatinine and LDL showed a significant but clinically irrelevant change six months after the end of the strict lockdown. The total number of DHDs for all drugs included in the study (except for benzodiazepines), decreased. In the same way, the use of health services by these patients also decreased. The impact of COVID-19 among this group of patients has been moderate. The reorganization of health and social services after the declaration of the state of alarm in our country made possible the maintenance of care for this vulnerable population."

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,Le Bert N,Gastroenterology,2020,2020/04/18,,,10.1053/j.gastro.2020.04.019,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of defective viral envelope proteins (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) and the duration of infection-most patients acquire the infection at birth or during the first years of life. We investigated the effects of these factors on patients' lymphocyte and HBV-specific T-cell populations.
METHODS: We collected blood samples and clinical data from 243 patients with HBV infection (3-75 years old) in the United Kingdom and China. We measured levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg, hepatitis B e antigen, and alanine aminotransferase; analyzed HBV genotypes; and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In PBMCs from 48 patients with varying levels of serum HBsAg, we measured 40 markers on nature killer and T cells by mass cytometry. PBMCs from 189 patients with chronic infection and 38 patients with resolved infections were incubated with HBV peptide libraries, and HBV-specific T cells were identified by interferon gamma enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assays or flow cytometry. We used multivariate linear regression and performed variable selection using the Akaike information criterion to identify covariates associated with HBV-specific responses of T cells.
RESULTS: Although T- and natural killer cell phenotypes and functions did not change with level of serum HBsAg, numbers of HBs-specific T cells correlated with serum levels of HBsAg (r = 0.3367; P < .00001). After we performed the variable selection, the multivariate linear regression model identified patient age as the only factor significantly associated with numbers of HBs-specific T cells (P = .000115). In patients younger than 30 years, HBs-specific T cells constituted 28.26% of the total HBV-specific T cells; this value decreased to 7.14% in patients older than 30 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of immune cells from patients with chronic HBV infection, we found that the duration of HBsAg exposure, rather than the quantity of HBsAg, was associated with the level of anti-HBV immune response. Although the presence of HBs-specific T cells might not be required for the clearance of HBV infection in all patients, strategies to restore anti-HBV immune responses should be considered in patients younger than 30 years."

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in neonates born at ≥34 weeks of gestation (WG). The primary endpoint was EOS, defined by isolation of pathogenic species from blood culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture within 72 hours after birth. Data on EOS were collected exhaustively from all maternity wards in Paris area (April 2019-March 2021).
RESULTS: 108 EOS were recorded (annual incidence, 0.32 per 1000 live births; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.38). In term infants, the most frequent pathogens were group B Streptococcus (GBS) (n=47) and Escherichia coli (n=20); in late preterm infants, the most frequent pathogens were E. coli (n=15) and GBS (n=7). Fifteen meningitis cases were diagnosed. Five E. coli strains (14%) were resistant to both amoxicillin and gentamicin, which is an empiric treatment for EOS. Of the 54 infants with GBS infections, 35 were born from mothers with negative GBS prepartum screening test and 8 from mothers with no screening. Two deaths were reported, both in term infants (Proteus mirabilis and E. coli).
CONCLUSION: In neonates ≥34 WG born in the Paris area, GBS was twice as frequent as E. coli in term infants. EOS was six times more frequent in late preterm than in term infants and was due to E. coli in 60% of cases. Prevention of GBS EOS and empiric antibiotic treatment of EOS could be improved."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective cohort study of HBV carriers with negative HBe antigen (2005-2012), with no other causes of liver disease.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients were included, with mean age 40.5±12.2 years; 54% were women, and 38% were of foreign origin; the number of foreign patients significantly increased (P&lt;.001) over the years. Transaminases were normal in nearly 75% and HBV-DNA was &lt;2,000IU/ml in 56% of patients at diagnosis. There was a gradual decrease in HBV-DNA levels in inactive carriers over the study period. Fibrosis study was performed in 47% of patients by Fibroscan® or liver biopsy: 55.4% normal histology and 6.1% cirrhosis. Just over three quarters of patients (77.77%) were inactive carriers. Treatment was required in 15.5% of patients (20% because of cirrhosis and 80% HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B). Five patients cleared HBsAg (annual rate .94%), all of whom presented HBV-DNA &lt;2,000IU/ml at diagnosis. Five patients developed complications (3.6%), 4 of them hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), of which only 2 had cirrhosis. There was 1 HBV-related death (.72%).
CONCLUSION: Among HBV carriers with negative HBe antigen, inactive HBs-Ag carriers are predominant. HBV-DNA gradually decreases in the first few years after diagnosis. Morbidity and mortality are low, especially if glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) is normal and HBV-DNA levels are low at diagnosis. Treatment is needed in a considerable number of patients. HCC is the most frequent complication, even in the absence of cirrhosis."

We sought to define clinical outcomes and incidence of chronic critical illness (CCI) after sepsis and to determine whether selected biomarkers of inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism differ between these patients and those that rapidly recover (RAP).
METHODS: This 3-year prospective observational cohort study (NCT02276417) evaluated 145 surgical intensive care unit patients with sepsis for the development of CCI (≥14 days of intensive care unit resource utilization with persistent organ dysfunction). Patient clinical demographics, outcomes, and serial serum/urine samples were collected for plasma protein and urinary metabolite analyses.
RESULTS: Of 145 sepsis patients enrolled, 19 (13%) died during their hospitalization and 71 (49%) developed CCI. The CCI patients were significantly older (mean, 63 ± 15 vs. 58 ± 13 years, p = 0.006) and more likely to be discharged to long-term acute care facilities (32% vs. 3%, p < 0.0001), whereas those with RAP were more often discharged to home or a rehabilitation facility. Six-month mortality was significantly higher in CCI as compared with RAP cohort (37% vs. 2%; p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression modeling revealed delayed onset sepsis (>48 hours after admission; odds ratio [OR], 10.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.15-28.82]), interfacility transfer (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.43-8.96), vasopressor-dependent septic shock (OR, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.47-9.54), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 5 or greater at 72 hours (OR, 5.03; 95% CI, 2.00-12.62) as independent risk factors for the development of CCI. The CCI patients also demonstrated greater elevations in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), and biomarker profiles are consistent with persistent immunosuppression (absolute lymphocyte count and soluble programmed death ligand 1) and catabolism (plasma insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 and urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion).
CONCLUSION: The development of CCI has become the predominant clinical trajectory in critically ill surgical patients with sepsis. These patients exhibit biomarker profiles consistent with an immunocatabolic phenotype of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism.

Epub 2021 Nov 9.,Rollin G,Int J Infect Dis,2022,2021/11/12,,,10.1016/j.ijid.2021.11.013,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze and compare the characteristics and outcomes of spontaneous meningitis (SM) versus postsurgical/traumatic meningitis (PSTM) due to Klebsiella pneumoniae.
METHODS: A retrospective multicentric cohort study of all K. pneumoniae meningitis cases managed between January 2007 and May 2018 was carried out in seven university hospitals in the Paris area. The microbiological characteristics of 16 available K. pneumoniae isolates were further analyzed, and the genomes of seven of those isolated from SM were sequenced.
RESULTS: Among 35 cases, 10 were SM and 25 were PSTM. SM cases more severe than PSTM cases, with higher septic shock (p = 0.004) and in-hospital mortality rates (p = 0.004). In contrast, relapse occurred in five patients from the PSTM group versus no patients from the SM group. All K. pneumoniae strains recovered from SM but none of those recovered from PSTM displayed hypervirulent phenotypic (positive string test) and genotypic (genes corresponding to capsular serotypes K1 or K2; virulence genes rmpA and iutA) characteristics (p < 0.0001). PSTM tended to be more frequently polymicrobial (p = 0.08) and caused by an extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing strain (p = 0.08) than SM.
CONCLUSIONS: SM and PSTM are two entities differing both from a clinical and a microbiological standpoint. SM appears to be a more serious infection, induced by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains."

Physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in PLHIV are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to describe physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness by sex and age and to examine the association between physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in PLHIV, controlling for covariates.
METHODS: Seven hundred two PLHIV participated in a cross-sectional study and completed validated measures of self-reported physical activity (7-day Physical Activity Recall) and cardiorespiratory fitness (6-minute walk test). Participants were recruited from 7 diverse sites in the United States and Thailand, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression to examine the relationship between physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness.
RESULTS: On average, participants self-reported engaging in 115 minutes of, mostly light (75%), physical activity. Men reported twice the amount of physical activity as women (155 vs 73 minutes, P = .01). Participants' ability to achieve their predicted 6-minute walk test distances was similar between men (68%) and women (69%) (P > .01). For women, vigorous physical activity was associated with a 6.6% increase in cardiorespiratory fitness and being temporarily unemployed was associated with an 18% decline in cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness increased with age (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Weekly physical activity of people living with human immunodeficiency virus averaged 85 minutes of mostly light activity, well below the recommended 150 minutes of moderate activity. Vigorous physical activity was associated with improved cardiorespiratory fitness in women, but not men. Although PLHIV would benefit from interventions to increase physical activity, our data suggest a need to develop sex-specific physical activity strategies."

Case-patients with CRE were compared to two control populations. In multivariate analysis comparing 160 CRE cases to 160 controls C1 (patients with a clinical sample positive for carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae), five characteristics were linked to CRE: male gender (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.3-3.4), travel in Asia (OR = 10.0; 95% CI = 1.1-91.2) and hospitalisation in (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.3-4.4) or out of (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 0.8-24.1) France in the preceding 12 months, infection in the preceding 3 months (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.5-5.9), and antibiotic receipt between admission and inclusion (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.0-3.3). In multivariate analysis comparing 148 CRE cases to 148 controls C2 [patients with culture-negative sample(s)], four characteristics were identified: prior infection (OR = 3.3; 95% CI = 1.6-6.8), urine drainage (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.5-6.1) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.7; 95% CI = 1.1-13.0) during the current hospitalisation, and antibiotic receipt between admission and inclusion (OR = 6.6; 95% CI = 2.8-15.5). Univariate analyses comparing separately CPE cases to controls (39 CPE vs C1 and 36 CPE vs C2) and non-CPE cases to controls (121 non-CPE vs C1 and 112 non-CPE vs C2), concomitantly with comparison of CPE to non-CPE cases showed that only CPE cases were at risk of previous travel and hospitalisation abroad. This study shows that, among CRE, risk factors are different for CPE and non-CPE infection, and suggests that question patients about their medical history and lifestyle should help for early identification of patients at risk of CPE among patients with CRE."

However, prospective studies in diverse populations in the United States addressing dietary patterns and mortality are limited.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the ability of the following 4 diet-quality indexes [the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010), the Alternative HEI-2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMED), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)] to predict the reduction in risk of mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer.
DESIGN: White, African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and Latino adults (n = 215,782) from the Multiethnic Cohort completed a quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Scores for each dietary index were computed and divided into quintiles for men and women. Mortality was documented over 13-18 y of follow-up. HRs and 95% CIs were computed by using adjusted Cox models.
RESULTS: High HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, aMED, and DASH scores were all inversely associated with risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, and cancer in both men and women (P-trend < 0.0001 for all models). For men, the HEI-2010 was consistently associated with a reduction in risk of mortality for all causes (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.79), CVD (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81), and cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.83) when lowest and highest quintiles were compared. In women, the AHEI and aMED showed large reductions for all-cause mortality (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.82), the AHEI showed large reductions for CVD (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.83), and the aMED showed large reductions for cancer (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76, 0. 92).
CONCLUSION: These results, in a US multiethnic population, suggest that consuming a dietary pattern that achieves a high diet-quality index score is associated with lower risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, and cancer in adult men and women."

Epub 2024 May 31.,Diddeniya G,J Dairy Sci,2024,2024/06/02,,,10.3168/jds.2024-24835,"This comprehensive review highlights the intricate interplay between maternal factors and the co-development of the microbiome and immune system in neonatal calves. Based on human and mouse studies, multiple prenatal and postnatal factors influence this process by altering the host-associated microbiomes (gut, respiratory tract, skin), microbial colonization trajectories, and priming of the immune systems (mucosal and systemic). This review emphasizes the importance of early-life exposure, highlighting postnatal factors that work in synergy with maternal factors in further fine-tuning the co-development of the neonatal microbiome and immunity. In cattle, there is a general lack of research to identify the maternal effect on the early colonization process of neonatal calves (gut, respiratory tract) and its impact on the priming of the immune system. Past studies have primarily investigated maternal effects on the passive transfer of immunity at birth. The co-development process of the microbiome and immune system is vital for lifelong health and production in cattle. Therefore, comprehensive research beyond the traditional focus on passive immunity is an essential step in this endeavor. Calf microbiome research reports the colonization of diverse bacterial communities in newborns, which is affected by the colostrum feeding method immediately after birth. In contrast to human studies reporting a strong link between maternal and infant bacterial communities, there is a lack of evidence to clearly define cow-to-calf transmission in cattle. Maternal exposure has been shown to promote the colonization of beneficial bacteria in neonatal calves. Nonetheless, calf microbiome research lacks links to early development of the immune system. An in-depth understanding of the influence of maternal factors on microbiomes and immunity will improve the management of pregnant cows to raise immune-fit neonatal calves. It is essential to investigate the diverse effects of maternal health conditions and nutrition during pregnancy on the gut microbiome and immunity of neonatal calves through collaboration among researchers from diverse fields such as microbiology, immunology, nutrition, veterinary science, and epidemiology."

Patients who were referred from the ED for psychiatric consultation (EDPC) at the Maggiore della Carità Hospital between March 2008 and March 2015 were recruited consecutively. Socio-demographic, clinical and consultation variables were recorded along with information about suicidal behaviours; migrants ( n = 379; 42.74% males, 57.26% females; age: 45.38 ± 16.95 years) were compared with native Italians ( n = 2942; 43.51% males, 56.49% females; age: 42.08 ± 15.89 years). Migrants were younger, more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be already under the care of a psychiatrist. Symptoms related to use of alcohol or substances were more frequent in migrants, especially female migrants. Migrants were less likely than native Italians to be referred for PC because of the presence of psychiatric symptoms, however they were more likely to be referred because of self-harming behaviour. Nonetheless, migrant status was not identified as a risk factor for suicidal behaviour in the multivariate analysis. The outcome of EDPC showed differences between migrants and natives. In absolute terms migrants were less likely to be admitted to a psychiatric ward after the EDPC than native Italians, while they were more likely to be monitored in the ED before being discharged or referred to outpatient care. In a high percentage of psychiatric examinations of migrants, no psychiatric symptoms were identified. Further studies are warranted to disentangle the meaning of these findings."

The Heart Assist 5 (Micromed Cardiovascular Inc, Houston, TX) continuous-flow LVAD has been on the market in Europe since May 2009.
METHODS: We evaluated nine Heart Assist 5 LVAD patients with two- and three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) parameters between December 2011 and December 2013. The pre-operative TTE LVAD evaluations included left ventricular (LV) function and structure, quantification of right ventricular (RV) function and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), assessment of aortic and mitral regurgitation, and presence of patent foramen ovale and intra-cardiac clots. Peri-operative TEE determined the inflow cannula and septum position, and assessed the de-airing process while weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Post-operative serial follow-up TTE showed the surgical results of LVAD implantation, determined the overall structure and function of the LV, RV and TR, and observed the inflow and outflow cannula position.
RESULTS: Nine patients who had undergone Heart Assist 5 LVAD implantation and had been followed up for more than 30 days were included in this study. Eight patients had ischaemic cardiomyopathy and one had adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. Pre-implantation data: the mean age of the patients was 52 ± 13 (34-64) years, mean body surface area (BSA) was 1.8 ± 0.2 (1.6-2.0) m2, mean cardiac index (CI) was 2.04 ± 0.4 (1.5-2.6) l/min/m2, mean cardiac output (CO) was 3.7 ± 0.7 (2.6-4.2) l/min, mean ejection fraction (EF) was 23 ± 5 (18-28)%, and right ventricular fractional area contraction (RVFAC) was 43 ± 9 (35-55)%. One patient had aortic valve replacement (AVR) during the LVAD implantation, and excess current alarms and increased power were suspected to be caused by a possible thrombus. Close follow up with TTE studies were carried out to clear the LV of thrombus formation, and the inflow cannula position was checked to maintain the septum in the midline, so preventing the suction cascade. Four patients were followed up for more than two years, and two were followed up for more than a year. Three patients died due to multi-organ failure. Follow-up speed-change TTE studies of six patients showed that the mean speed was 9 800 ± 600 (9 500-10 400) rpm, and mean CO was 4.7 ± 0.3 (4.3-5.0) l/min during the three-month post-implant period.
CONCLUSION: We believe that TTE can play a major role in managing LVAD patients to achieve optimal settings for each patient. A large series is mandatory for assessment of echocardiographic studies on Heart Assist 5 LVAD."

Design: Observational, cross-sectional study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Women (18-65 years old) who underwent bariatric surgery (BG) ≥ 2 years and reached stable weight ≥ 6 months, were investigated. Control group (CG) comprised non-operated matched women with obesity. Body composition was determined through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Low lean mass (LLM) was defined as appendicular lean mass index (ALM kg/height m2) &lt; 5.5 kg/m2. Physical strength was assessed through dynamometer and sit-to-stand test (SST), whereas performance was assessed through 4-m gait speed and Short Physical Performance Battery Tests (SPPB). Sarcopenia was diagnosed in the presence of LLM and low strength.
RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty women (60 in each group, 50 ± 9.7 years old) were investigated. All anthropometric and body composition parameters were lower in BG than in CG, whereas strength and performance were similar between groups. Women with reduced strength presented high total fat mass and low physical activity level (p < 0.005). LLM was observed in 35% of BG and in 18.3% of CG (p = 0.04), whereas sarcopenia was diagnosed in 28.3% of BG and in 16.6% of CG (p = 0.12). Sarcopenic women in BG had better performance both in SST (p = 0.001) and SPPB (p = 0.004). Total lean mass (OR:1.41, 95% CI [1.18; 1.69], p < 0.001) and obesity (OR: 38.2 [2.27; 644.12], p < 0.001) were associated with sarcopenia in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Despite great weight loss, sarcopenia prevalence did not increase in BG and its presence was influenced by total lean mass and obesity."

This overview aimed to describe the main measures planned for the 2020-2021 academic year within the WHO European Region. A rapid systematic review of scientific databases was also performed. The websites of the government, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Education of European Region countries were searched through 1 October for official documents about the prevention and management of suspected cases/confirmed cases in primary and secondary schools. To find further suggestions, a rapid systematic review was conducted through 20 October searching Pubmed, Scopus, and Embase. There were 23 official documents. France, Luxembourg, Malta, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Spain, and San Marino were considered. Performing the rapid review, 855 records were identified and 7 papers were finally selected. The recommendations mostly agreed. However, there was no consensus on the criteria for the return to school of students that tested positive, and the flexibility between attendance at school and remote education for high-risk children often varied. School closure was commonly considered as the very last resort for COVID-19 control. Studies are required to evaluate the impact of different recommendations during this autumn term."

Epub 2024 Apr 9.,Blanchard F,Lancet Infect Dis,2024,2024/04/12,,,10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00151-8,"BACKGROUND: Listeriosis is a foodborne infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Three main forms of listeriosis are well characterised, but little is known about L monocytogenes-associated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We used data from the French national surveillance of listeriosis to perform a nationwide retrospective study.
METHODS: All patients with L monocytogenes isolated by culture from a peritoneal fluid sample in France between April 1, 1993, and Dec 31, 2022, were included. Individuals for whom bacterial peritonitis was not confirmed and those who also had another type of invasive listeriosis were excluded. A standardised checklist was used to collect demographic, clinical, and biological data as well as antibiotic treatment and follow-up data. The primary outcome was to determine the characteristics of L monocytogenes-associated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We did descriptive analyses and assessed risk factors for 1-month mortality using an exploratory multivariable Cox model analysis.
FINDINGS: Among the 8768 L monocytogenes cases reported, 208 (2%) were patients with L monocytogenes-associated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Mean age was 65 years (SD 13), 50 (24%) of 208 patients were female, and 158 (76%) were male (no data on race or ethnicity were available). 200 (98%) of 205 patients with L monocytogenes-associated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with available data had immunosuppressive comorbidities, including cirrhosis (148 [74%] of 201 with available data), ongoing alcoholism (58 [62%] of 94), and ongoing neoplasia (60 [31%] of 195). Causes of ascites included cirrhosis (146 [70%] of 208), ongoing neoplasia (26 [13%]), end-stage heart failure (13 [6%]), and peritoneal dialysis (11 [5%]). Among those with available data, presentation was pauci-symptomatic and non-specific; only 67 (50%) of 135 patients presented with fever, 49 (37%) of 132 with abdominal pain, and 27 (21%) of 129 with diarrhoea. 61 (29%) of 208 patients were dead at 1 month, 92 (44%) were dead at 3 months, and 109 (52%) were dead at 6 months after diagnosis. Ongoing neoplasia (hazard ratio 2·42 [95% CI 1·05-5·56]; p=0·039), septic shock (8·03 [2·66-24·02]; p=0·0021), and high blood leukocyte count (1·05 [1·00-1·09]; p=0·045) were independently associated with 1-month mortality.
INTERPRETATION: Despite the non-specific and mild presentation of L monocytogenes-associated spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the outcome is poor and similar to that of neurolisteriosis, and so identification of L monocytogenes in ascitic fluid samples requires urgent parenteral amoxicillin-based treatment to avoid a fatal outcome.

Six left sided breast cancer patients were CT-simulated in S and P positions and four patients only in P position. Treatment plans were made using non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc photon therapy (VMAT) or pencil beam scanning intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Dose prescription was 15*2.67 Gy(GyRBE). The average mean heart doses for S or P VMAT were 5.6 or 4.3 Gy, respectively (p = 0.16) and 1.02 or 1.08 GyRBE, respectively for IMPT (p = 0.8; p < 0.001 for IMPT versus VMAT). The average mean lung doses for S or P VMAT were 5.91 or 2.90 Gy, respectively (p = 0.002) and 1.56 or 1.09 GyRBE, respectively for IMPT (p = 0.016). In high-risk patients, average (range) thirty-year mortality rates from radiotherapy-related cardiac injury and lung cancer were estimated at 6.8(5.4-9.4)% or 3.8(2.8-5.1)% for S or P VMAT (p < 0.001), respectively, and 1.6(1.1-2.0)% or 1.2(0.8-1.6)% for S or P IMPT (p = 0.25), respectively. Radiation-related mortality risk could outweigh the ~8% disease-specific survival benefit of WB + LN_IM radiotherapy for S VMAT but not P VMAT. IMPT carries the lowest radiation-related mortality risks."

However, it is also evident that children and adolescents have been significantly impacted and experienced major disruptions in their lives. The psychological, mental, and developmental repercussions have been major and have led to a reshaping of drug abuse dynamics and substance addiction. The authors have outlined a narrative review of the major issues affecting adolescents and their mental well-being by clarifying the lingering effects and pandemic aftermath, especially on drug abuse, developmental aspects, and behavioral addiction. The unique traits of adolescent risk factors have been outlined, in order to identify areas to be prioritized for future strategies. Possible repercussions on juvenile crime linked to social estrangedness and disrupted interactions have been briefly explored as well. All such aspects are highly meaningful and relevant from a medicolegal perspective as well. The looming mental health crisis involving youngsters will have to be confronted by fine-tuning and optimizing mental health care services, building on current experiences, raising awareness, and eliminating the stigma that often comes with mental issues. Healthcare systems should look at the current scenario as an opportunity to improve care delivery to eliminate access inequalities and stigmatization of mental issues and raise awareness for the benefit and well-being of all. Similarly, law enforcement, lawmakers, and the judiciary will have to account for such factors, too, as will economic policy-makers. In that regard, a set of defining criteria has been framed in order to provide a degree of objectivity when meeting the unique challenges of the pandemic for youth mental health, in a comprehensive and tailored fashion."

Studies have shown that the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and mortality is null or even inverted within this age group. This relationship could be modified by the presence of frailty. This study was performed to examine the effect of frailty on the association between cardiovascular risk factors and mortality in the oldest old.
METHODS: The BELFRAIL study is a prospective, observational, population-based cohort study of 567 subjects aged 80 years and older. Data on cardiovascular risk factors were recorded. Frailty was assessed using three different models: the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Fried and Puts models. Participants were considered robust if they were 'not frail' according to all three models, and frail if they met the frailty criteria for one of the three models. The follow-up data on mortality and cause of death were registered.
RESULTS: No cardiovascular risk factor was associated with mortality in subjects with and without cardiovascular disease. The presence of frailty was a strong risk factor for mortality [HR: 2.5, 95%CI: (1.9-3.2) for all-cause mortality; HR: 2.2, 95%CI: (1.4-3.4) for cardiovascular mortality]. In robust patients, a history of cardiovascular disease increased the risk for mortality [HR: 1.7, 95%CI: (1.1-2.5) for all-cause mortality; HR: 2.2, 95%CI: (1.2-3.9) for cardiovascular mortality]. In frail patients, there was no association between any of the traditional risk factors and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with mortality in very old subjects. Frailty was shown to be a strong risk factor for mortality in this age group. However, frailty could not be used to identify additional subjects who might benefit more from cardiovascular risk management."

Here, we report results on treatment safety.
METHODS: MPH and PLAC were flexibly dosed. Among 433 randomized patients, adverse events (AEs) were documented and analyzed on an ""as received"" basis during week 0-52. Electrocardiogram data were recorded at baseline and week 24.
RESULTS: Comparing 205 patients who received ≥1 dose of MPH with 209 patients who received PLAC, AEs occurring significantly more frequently in the MPH group were decreased appetite (22 vs. 3.8%), dry mouth (15 vs. 4.8%), palpitations (13 vs. 3.3%), gastrointestinal infection (11 vs. 4.8%), agitation (11 vs. 3.3%), restlessness (10 vs. 2.9%), hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, weight decrease (all 6.3 vs. 1.9%), depressive symptom, influenza (both 4.9 vs. 1.0%), and acute tonsillitis (4.4 vs. 0.5%). Syncope occurred significantly more often in the PLAC group (2.4 vs. 0%). Clinically relevant ECG changes occurred very rarely in both groups. Serious AEs were rare and without a significant group difference. The comparison of 206 patients treated with GPT versus 209 patients who received CM revealed no major differences. Serious AE classified as psychiatric occurred in 5 cases in the CM group and in 1 case in the GPT group.
CONCLUSION: In this so far longest-running clinical trial, methylphenidate treatment was safe and well-tolerated."

The Ten-Eleven-Translocation (TET) family of proteins is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hmC. We hypothesized that epigenetic editing by 5-hmC might be a novel mechanism through which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-associated molecular traits could be explained.Hence, we performed an observational study to explore global levels of 5-hmC in fresh liver samples of patients with NAFLD and controls (n = 90) using an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay and immunohistochemistry. We also screened for genetic variation in TET 1-3 loci by next generation sequencing to explore its contribution to the disease biology. The study was conducted in 2 stages (discovery and replication) and included 476 participants.We observed that the amount of 5-hmC in the liver of both NAFLD patients and controls was relatively low (up to 0.1%); a significant association was found with liver mitochondrial DNA copy number (R = 0.50, P = 0.000382) and PPARGC1A-mRNA levels (R = -0.57, P = 0.04).We did not observe any significant difference in the 5-hmC nuclear immunostaining score between NAFLD patients and controls; nevertheless, we found that patients with NAFLD (0.4 ± 0.5) had significantly lower nonnuclear-5-hmC staining compared with controls (1.8 ± 0.8), means ± standard deviation, P = 0.028. The missense p.Ile1123Met variant (TET1-rs3998860) was significantly associated with serum levels of caspase-generated CK-18 fragment-cell death biomarker in the discovery and replication stage, and the disease severity (odds ratio: 1.47, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.97; P = 0.005). The p.Ile1762Val substitution (TET2-rs2454206) was associated with liver PPARGC1A-methylation and transcriptional levels, and Type 2 diabetes.Our results suggest that 5-hmC might be involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating liver mitochondrial biogenesis and PPARGC1A expression. Genetic diversity at TET loci suggests an ""epigenetic"" regulation of programmed liver-cell death and a TET-mediated fine-tuning of the liver PPARGC1A-transcriptional program."

Sentiment analysis, a computational process of identifying and categorizing opinions and judgment expressed in text, may enhance traditional prediction methodologies based on structured variables. Large language models (LLMs), such as generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), have demonstrated abilities to perform sentiment analyses on non-clinical texts. We sought to determine if GPT-performed sentiment analysis could improve upon predictions using clinical covariates alone in the prediction of HRS-AKI.
METHODS: Adult patients admitted to a single academic medical center with decompensated cirrhosis and AKI. We used a protected health information (PHI) compliant version of Microsoft Azure OpenAI GPT-4o to derive a sentiment score ranging from 0 to 1 for HRS-AKI, and conduct natural language processing (NLP) extraction of clinical terms associated with HRS-AKI in clinical notes. The area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) was compared in logistic regression models incorporating structured variables (socio-demographics, MELD 3.0, hemodynamic parameters) with compared to without sentiment scores and NLP-extracted clinical terms.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 314 participants, higher sentiment score was associated with the diagnosis of HRS-AKI (OR 1.33 per 0.1, 95% CI 1.02-1.79) in multivariate models. AUROC of the baseline model using structured clinical covariates alone was 0.639. With the addition of the GPT-4o derived sentiment score and clinical terms to structured covariates, the final model yielded an improved AUROC of 0.758 (p=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical texts contain large amounts of data that are currently difficult to extract using standard methodologies. Sentiment analysis and NLP-based variable derivation with GPT-4o in clinical application is feasible and can improve the prediction of HRS-AKI over traditional modeling methodologies alone."

Unfortunately, the time and effort needed from well-trained human subject matter experts makes extensive manual social media listening unfeasible. Generative large language models (LLMs) can potentially summarize and interpret large amounts of text, but it is unclear to what extent LLMs can glean subtle health-related meanings in large sets of social media posts and reasonably report health-related themes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs for topic model selection or inductive thematic analysis of large contents of social media posts by attempting to answer the following question: Can LLMs conduct topic model selection and inductive thematic analysis as effectively as humans did in a prior manual study, or at least reasonably, as judged by subject matter experts?
METHODS: We asked the same research question and used the same set of social media content for both the LLM selection of relevant topics and the LLM analysis of themes as was conducted manually in a published study about vaccine rhetoric. We used the results from that study as background for this LLM experiment by comparing the results from the prior manual human analyses with the analyses from 3 LLMs: GPT4-32K, Claude-instant-100K, and Claude-2-100K. We also assessed if multiple LLMs had equivalent ability and assessed the consistency of repeated analysis from each LLM.
RESULTS: The LLMs generally gave high rankings to the topics chosen previously by humans as most relevant. We reject a null hypothesis (P<.001, overall comparison) and conclude that these LLMs are more likely to include the human-rated top 5 content areas in their top rankings than would occur by chance. Regarding theme identification, LLMs identified several themes similar to those identified by humans, with very low hallucination rates. Variability occurred between LLMs and between test runs of an individual LLM. Despite not consistently matching the human-generated themes, subject matter experts found themes generated by the LLMs were still reasonable and relevant.
CONCLUSIONS: LLMs can effectively and efficiently process large social media-based health-related data sets. LLMs can extract themes from such data that human subject matter experts deem reasonable. However, we were unable to show that the LLMs we tested can replicate the depth of analysis from human subject matter experts by consistently extracting the same themes from the same data. There is vast potential, once better validated, for automated LLM-based real-time social listening for common and rare health conditions, informing public health understanding of the public's interests and concerns and determining the public's ideas to address them."

Here, we describe the large European MultiPartner IPF Registry (EMPIRE) and validate predictors of long-term survival in IPF.
METHODS: The multinational prospective EMPIRE registry enrolled IPF patients from 48 sites in 10 Central and Eastern European countries since 2014. Survival from IPF diagnosis until death was estimated, accounting for left-truncation. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of death for prognostic factors, using restricted cubic splines to fit continuous factors.
RESULTS: The cohort included 1620 patients (mean age at diagnosis 67.6 years, 71% male, 63% smoking history), including 75% enrolled within 6 months of diagnosis. Median survival was 4.5 years, with 45% surviving 5 years post-diagnosis. Compared with GAP stage I, mortality was higher with GAP stages II (HR 2.9; 95% CI: 2.3-3.7) and III (HR 4.0; 95% CI: 2.8-5.7) while, with redefined cut-offs, the corresponding HRs were 2.7 (95% CI: 1.8-4.0) and 5.8 (95% CI: 4.0-8.3) respectively. Mortality was higher with concurrent pulmonary hypertension (HR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.5-2.9) and lung cancer (HR 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3-4.9).
CONCLUSIONS: EMPIRE, one of the largest long-term registries of patients with IPF, provides a more accurate confirmation of prognostic factors and co-morbidities on longer term five-year mortality. It also suggests that some fine-tuning of the indices for mortality may provide a more accurate long-term prognostic profile for these patients."

However, the current evaluation of these models often relies on fine-tuning and limited datasets, which introduces biases and limits the assessment of their true potential. Here, we present a benchmarking study of three recent DNA foundation language models, including DNABERT-2, Nucleotide Transformer version-2 (NT-v2), and HyenaDNA, focusing on the quality of their zero-shot embeddings across a diverse range of genomic tasks and species through analyses of 57 real datasets. We found that DNABERT-2 exhibits the most consistent performance across human genome-related tasks, while NT-v2 excels in epigenetic modification detection. HyenaDNA stands out for its exceptional runtime scalability and ability to handle long input sequences. Importantly, we demonstrate that using mean token embedding consistently improves the performance of all three models compared to the default setting of sentence-level summary token embedding, with average AUC improvements ranging from 4.3% to 9.7% for different DNA foundation models. Furthermore, the performance differences between these models are significantly reduced when using mean token embedding. Our findings provide a framework for selecting and optimizing DNA language models, guiding researchers in applying these tools effectively in genomic studies."

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval (IR) methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system's ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections."

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of medical knowledge in the most advanced LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus) as of 2024. It is the first to evaluate these LLMs using a non-English medical licensing exam. The insights from this study will guide educators, policymakers, and technical experts in the effective use of AI in medical education and clinical diagnosis.
METHOD: Authors inputted 790 questions from Japanese National Medical Examination into the chat windows of the LLMs to obtain responses. Two authors independently assessed the correctness. Authors analyzed the overall accuracy rates of the LLMs and compared their performance on image and non-image questions, questions of varying difficulty levels, general and clinical questions, and questions from different medical specialties. Additionally, authors examined the correlation between the number of publications and LLMs' performance in different medical specialties.
RESULTS: GPT-4o achieved highest accuracy rate of 89.2% and outperformed the other LLMs in overall performance and each specific category. All four LLMs performed better on non-image questions than image questions, with a 10% accuracy gap. They also performed better on easy questions compared to normal and difficult ones. GPT-4o achieved a 95.0% accuracy rate on easy questions, marking it as an effective knowledge source for medical education. Four LLMs performed worst on ""Gastroenterology and Hepatology"" specialty. There was a positive correlation between the number of publications and LLM performance in different specialties.
CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4o achieved an overall accuracy rate close to 90%, with 95.0% on easy questions, significantly outperforming the other LLMs. This indicates GPT-4o's potential as a knowledge source for easy questions. Image-based questions and question difficulty significantly impact LLM accuracy. ""Gastroenterology and Hepatology"" is the specialty with the lowest performance. The LLMs' performance across medical specialties correlates positively with the number of related publications."

METHODS: A cohort study with 283 CHD subjects was launched from 2011 to 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression model, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and nomogram were used to compare the effect of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on secondary PCI rate and disease risk factors. Even why the two statins had different effects based on gene expression profile analysis has been explored.
RESULTS: Gene FFA (Freely fatty acid), AST (Aspartate Transaminase) and ALT (Alanine transaminase) showed the statistical difference between the four statin groups (P<0.05). In the AA group (Continuous Atorvastatin usage), albumin was a risk factor (Hazard Ratio (HR):1.076, 95%CI (1.001, 1.162), p<0.05). In the AR group (Start with Atorvastatin usage, then change to Rosuvastatin usage), ApoA was a protective factor (HR:0.004, 95%CI (0.001, 0.665), p<0.05). GLB (Galactosidase Beta) was a risk factor (HR:1.262, 95%CI (1.010, 1.576), p<0.05). In RR group (Continuous Rosuvastatin usage), ApoE was a protective factor (HR:0.943, 95%CI (0.890, 1.000), <0.05). ALT was a risk factor (HR:1.030, 95%CI (1.000, 1.060), p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Patients in the RA group had the lowest secondary PCI rate. ALT was a risk factor in the RR group. Gene Gpt (Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase) encoded for one subtype of ALT had a significantly different expression in different statin groups."

To improve our understanding of the development of psychosis, a different approach to psychopathology may be productive. We propose to reconceptualise psychopathology from a network perspective, according to which symptoms act as a dynamic, interconnected system, impacting on each other over time and across diagnostic boundaries to form symptom networks. Adopting this network approach, the Mapping Individual Routes of Risk and Resilience study aims to determine whether characteristics of symptom networks can predict illness course and outcome of early psychotic symptoms.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The sample consists of n=100 participants aged 18-35 years, divided into four subgroups (n=4×25) with increasing levels of severity of psychopathology, representing successive stages of clinical progression. Individuals representing the initial stage have a relatively low expression of psychotic experiences (general population), whereas individuals representing the end stage are help seeking and display a psychometric expression of psychosis, putting them at ultra-high risk for transition to psychotic disorder. At baseline and 1-year follow-up, participants report their symptoms, affective states and experiences for three consecutive months in short, daily questionnaires on their smartphone, which will be used to map individual networks. Network parameters, including the strength and directionality of symptom connections and centrality indices, will be estimated and associated to individual differences in and within-individual progression through stages of clinical severity and functioning over the next 3 years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the local medical ethical committee (ABR no. NL52974.042.15). The results of the study will be published in (inter)national peer-reviewed journals, presented at research, clinical and general public conferences. The results will assist in improving and fine-tuning dynamic models of psychopathology, stimulating both clinical and scientific progress.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in transforming cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports into text that is comprehensible to medical laypersons.
METHODS: ChatGPT with GPT-4 architecture was used to generate three different explained versions of 20 various CMR reports (n = 60) using the same prompt: ""Explain the radiology report in a language understandable to a medical layperson"". Two cardiovascular radiologists evaluated understandability, factual correctness, completeness of relevant findings, and lack of potential harm, while 13 medical laypersons evaluated the understandability of the original and the GPT-4 reports on a Likert scale (1 ""strongly disagree"", 5 ""strongly agree""). Readability was measured using the Automated Readability Index (ARI). Linear mixed-effects models (values given as median [interquartile range]) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: GPT-4 reports were generated on average in 52 s ± 13. GPT-4 reports achieved a lower ARI score (10 [9-12] vs 5 [4-6]; p < 0.001) and were subjectively easier to understand for laypersons than original reports (1 [1] vs 4 [4,5]; p < 0.001). Eighteen out of 20 (90%) standard CMR reports and 2/60 (3%) GPT-generated reports had an ARI score corresponding to the 8th grade level or higher. Radiologists' ratings of the GPT-4 reports reached high levels for correctness (5 [4, 5]), completeness (5 [5]), and lack of potential harm (5 [5]); with ""strong agreement"" for factual correctness in 94% (113/120) and completeness of relevant findings in 81% (97/120) of reports. Test-retest agreement for layperson understandability ratings between the three simplified reports generated from the same original report was substantial (ICC: 0.62; p < 0.001). Interrater agreement between radiologists was almost perfect for lack of potential harm (ICC: 0.93, p < 0.001) and moderate to substantial for completeness (ICC: 0.76, p < 0.001) and factual correctness (ICC: 0.55, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: GPT-4 can reliably transform complex CMR reports into more understandable, layperson-friendly language while largely maintaining factual correctness and completeness, and can thus help convey patient-relevant radiology information in an easy-to-understand manner."

Epub 2024 Jul 31.,Neyarapally GA,Drug Saf,2024,2024/07/31,PMC11554693,,10.1007/s40264-024-01468-8,"INTRODUCTION: The accurate identification and timely updating of adverse reactions in drug labeling are crucial for patient safety and effective drug use. Postmarketing surveillance plays a pivotal role in identifying previously undetected adverse events (AEs) that emerge when a drug is used in broader and more diverse patient populations. However, traditional methods of updating drug labeling with new AE information have been manual, time consuming, and error prone. This paper introduces the LabelComp tool, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of postmarketing drug safety surveillance. Utilizing a combination of text analytics and a trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, the LabelComp tool automatically identifies changes in AE terms from updated drug labeling documents.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to create and validate an AI tool with high accuracy that could enable researchers and FDA reviewers to efficiently identify safety-related drug labeling changes.
RESULTS: Our validation study of 87 drug labeling PDF pairs demonstrates the tool's high accuracy, with F1 scores of overall performance ranging from 0.795 to 0.936 across different evaluation tiers and a recall of at least 0.997 with only one missed AE out of 483 total AEs detected, indicating the tool's efficacy in identifying new AEs.
CONCLUSION: The LabelComp tool can support drug safety surveillance and inform regulatory decision-making. The publication of this tool also aims to encourage further community-driven enhancements, aligning with broader interests in applying AI to advance regulatory science and public health."

This post-hoc analysis evaluates the multimodal effects of first-line medication (methylphenidate [MPH] vs placebo [PLB]) and psychotherapeutic (group psychotherapy [GPT] vs clinical management [CM]) treatments on the ADHD core symptoms inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. For the two-by-two factorial, observer-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled Comparison of Methylphenidate and Psychotherapy in Adult ADHD Study (COMPAS; ISRCTN54096201), 419 outpatients with ADHD were considered for analysis. ADHD symptoms were assessed by blind observer-rated and patient-rated Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales before treatment (T1), 13 weeks (T2) and 26 weeks (T3) after T1, at treatment completion after 52 weeks (T4), and at follow-up (130 weeks, T5). MPH was superior to PLB in improving symptoms of inattention at almost all endpoints (observer-rated T2, T3, T4, T5; patient-rated T2, T3, T4), while a significant decrease in hyperactivity and impulsivity was at first found after 6 months of treatment. CM compared to GPT decreased inattention and impulsivity in the early treatment phase only (observer-rated T2, patient-rated T2, T3). In conclusion, while MPH seems to have a direct and sustained effect on inattention, premature medication discontinuation should particularly be avoided in patients with hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Also, especially in high inattention and/or impulsivity presentations, initial individual patient management might be beneficial. Consequently, considering individual core symptom profiles may enhance the efficacy of treatments in adult ADHD."

To identify the changes induced by HIV co-infection we compared MTB-specific CD4+ responses in subjects with active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI), with and without HIV co-infection. CD4+ T-cell subsets producing interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and expressing CD279 (PD-1) were measured using polychromatic flow-cytometry. HIV-TB co-infection was consistently and independently associated with a reduced frequency of CD4+ IFN-γ and IL-2-dual secreting T-cells and the proportion correlated inversely with HIV viral load (VL). The impact of HIV co-infection on this key MTB-specific T-cell subset identifies them as a potential correlate of mycobacterial immune containment. The percentage of MTB-specific IFN-γ-secreting T-cell subsets that expressed PD-1 was increased in active TB with HIV co-infection and correlated with VL. This identifies a novel correlate of dysregulated immunity to MTB, which may in part explain the paucity of inflammatory response in the face of mycobacterial dissemination that characterizes active TB with HIV co-infection."

A systematic review was performed by searching in MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 1966 to 1 August 2015. All studies reporting hazard ratios or data on survival and histological regression were included. Primary random-effects meta-analyses were used to summarize outcome measures. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 -test and I2 -statistic. To assess the potential bias of small studies we used funnel plots and the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted rank correlation method. Summaries of survival outcomes were measured as hazard ratios or relative risk of death at 5 years according to the presence of histological regression of primary melanoma. In total, 183 articles were reviewed out of 1876 retrieved. Ten studies comprising 8557 patients were included. Patients with histological regression had a lower relative risk of death (0·77, 95% confidence interval 0·61-0·97) than those without. Examination of the funnel plot did not provide evidence of publication bias. The results showed that histological regression is a protective factor for survival."

The evolution of depression, cognitive functioning, and fatigue was evaluated in a group of older cancer patients in comparison with a group of younger cancer patients and older persons without cancer.
METHODS: Older (≥70 years) and younger cancer patients (50-69 years) with breast or colorectal cancer stage I-III, and older persons without cancer (≥70 years) were included. Data were collected at baseline and one year follow-up and were available for 536 persons. Depression was evaluated with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Cognitive functioning was measured with the cognitive functioning subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Fatigue was measured with a Visual Analogue Scale. Risk factors for depression, cognitive functioning, and fatigue were analysed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. Risk factors included cancer- and ageing-related factors such as functional status, cancer treatment, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: The evolution of psychosocial problems was similar for the group of older (N = 125) and younger cancer patients (N = 196): an increase in depression (p < 0.01), slight worsening in cognitive functioning (p = 0.01), and no clear change in fatigue. Also, compared to the group of people without cancer (N = 215), the differences were small and after one year of follow-up only depression was more frequent in older cancer patients compared to older persons without cancer (18% versus 9%, p = 0.04). In multivariate analyses the main risk factors for psychosocial problems after one year follow-up were changes in functional status and presence of baseline depression, fatigue, or cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: Over the course of one year after a diagnosis of cancer, cancer patients face increasing levels of depression and increasing difficulties in cognitive functioning. The main risk factor for psychosocial problems was presence of the problem at baseline. This calls for regular screening for psychosocial problems and exchange of information on psychosocial functioning between different health care providers and settings during the treatment and follow-up trajectory of cancer patients."

Epub 2017 Sep 14.,Hosomura N,Diabet Med,2017,2017/09/15,,,10.1111/dme.13454,"AIMS: To design and validate a natural language processing algorithm to identify insulin therapy decline from the text of physician notes, and to determine the prevalence of insulin therapy decline and its impact on insulin initiation.
METHODS: We designed the algorithm using the publicly available natural language processing platform Canary. We evaluated the accuracy of the algorithm on 1501 randomly selected primary care physicians' notes from the electronic medical record system of a large academic medical centre. Using the validated language model, we then studied the prevalence of insulin therapy decline between 2000 and 2014.
RESULTS: The algorithm identified documentation of insulin therapy decline with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 82.4-100), a positive predictive value of 95% (95% CI 74.4-99.9), and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100.0). We identified 3295 insulin-naïve adults with Type 2 diabetes who were recommended insulin therapy; 984 of them (29.9%) initially declined insulin. People with HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥ 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) were more likely [766/2239 (34.2%)] to have declined insulin than people with HbA<sub>1c</sub> 53-63 mmol/mol (7.0-7.9%) and 64-74 mmol/mol (8.0-8.9%; P &lt; 0.0001). Among the people who initially declined but ultimately started insulin [374/984 (38.0%)], mean time to insulin initiation was 790 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin therapy decline is common, potentially leading to progression of hyperglycaemia and a delay in achievement of glycaemic control. Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons, risk factors and long-term outcomes of this important clinical phenomenon."

However, directed evolution methods are labor intensive, cannot efficiently optimize over multiple protein properties, and are often trapped by local maxima. In silico-directed evolution methods incorporating protein language models (PLMs) have the potential to accelerate this engineering process, but current approaches fail to generalize across diverse protein families. We introduce EVOLVEpro, a few-shot active learning framework to rapidly improve protein activity using a combination of PLMs and protein activity predictors, achieving improved activity with as few as four rounds of evolution. EVOLVEpro substantially enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of in silico protein evolution, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods and yielding proteins with up to 100-fold improvement of desired properties. We showcase EVOLVEpro for five proteins across three applications: T7 RNA polymerase for RNA production, a miniature CRISPR nuclease, a prime editor, and an integrase for genome editing, and a monoclonal antibody for epitope binding. These results demonstrate the advantages of few-shot active learning with small amounts of experimental data over zero-shot predictions. EVOLVEpro paves the way for broader applications of AI-guided protein engineering in biology and medicine."

Epub 2017 Mar 7.,Williams JF,J Surg Educ,2017,2017/03/12,,,10.1016/j.jsurg.2017.02.004,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop an objective motor skills testing system to aid in the evaluation of potential orthopedic residents.
DESIGN: Participants attempted a battery of 5 motor skills tests (4 novel tests and the Grooved Pegboard [GPT] Test) in one 10-minute session. A percentile-based scoring system was created for each test based on raw scores. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare testing scores among 3 cohorts. Each novel test and overall scores were compared with GPT scores as a relative measure of validity.
SETTING: The 2015 orthopedic surgery residency interview season at an academic institution.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty orthopedic residents and 72 nonresidents (15 community volunteers and 57 orthopedic surgery residency applicants).
RESULTS: Overall, residents performed better than nonresidents (p < 0.0001) and applicants performed worse than residents or volunteers (p < 0.0001). There were positive correlations between the GPT score and overall battery score (r = 0.63), screw and nut test (r = 0.40), and mimic a structure test (r = 0.26). The fracture reduction test and drilling test scores did not correlate to performance on the GPT.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychomotor testing for surgical applicants is an area in need of study. This investigation successfully piloted a novel battery of tests, which is easily reproducible and thus may be feasible for use in the orthopedic surgery residency interview setting. Longitudinal evaluation is required to explore correlation with future operative skill."

Epub 2019 Jun 22.,Storr A,Reprod Biomed Online,2019,2019/09/14,,,10.1016/j.rbmo.2019.06.008,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Which blastocyst morphology parameter is associated with live birth after controlling for female age and endometrial receptivity?
DESIGN: Retrospective study including fresh single blastocyst transfers (n = 2461) where the value of serum progesterone on day of human chorionic gonadotrophin trigger (PdHCG) was available. Generalized estimating equation regression models evaluated the independent effects of developmental stage (DevSt), inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm grade on live birth rates while controlling for the confounding effects of female age and PdHCG.
RESULTS: DevSt was strongly associated with the probability of live birth (P < 0.0001) independently of female age (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-0.91) and PdHCG (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87). For full blastocysts, expanded blastocysts and hatching blastocysts, addition of ICM and trophectoderm grading in the multivariable analysis suggested that besides female age (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94) and PdHCG (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.87), only DevSt (P = 0.001) and trophectoderm quality (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of live birth, while the predictive capacity of ICM was no longer significant. The mean probability of live birth was highest for AA blastocysts (35.0%), followed by BA blastocysts (31.2%) and AB blastocysts (27.7%).
CONCLUSION: This large study analyses for the first time the independent role of blastocyst morphology in predicting live birth while controlling for female age and PdHCG. Its findings suggest that DevSt and then trophectoderm grade are stronger predictors of live birth over ICM grade when selecting a single blastocyst for transfer."

METHODS: This study explored the potential of using natural language processing (NLP) to harmonise different mental health questionnaires by matching individual questions based on their semantic content. Using the Sentence-BERT model, we calculated the semantic similarity (cosine index) between 741 pairs of questions from five questionnaires. Drawing on data from a representative UK sample of adults (N = 2,058), we calculated a Spearman rank correlation for each of the same pairs of items, and then estimated the correlation between the cosine values and Spearman coefficients. We also used network analysis to explore the model's ability to uncover structures within the data and metadata.
RESULTS: We found a moderate overall correlation (r = .48, p < .001) between the two indices. In a holdout sample, the cosine scores predicted the real-world correlations with a small degree of error (MAE = 0.05, MedAE = 0.04, RMSE = 0.064) suggesting the utility of NLP in identifying similar items for cross-study data pooling. Our NLP model could detect more complex patterns in our data, however it required manual rules to decide which edges to include in the network.
CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that it is possible to quantify the semantic similarity between pairs of questionnaire items from their meta-data, and these similarity indices correlate with how participants would answer the same two items. This highlights the potential of NLP to facilitate cross-study data pooling in mental health research. Nevertheless, researchers are cautioned to verify the psychometric equivalence of matched items."

Epub 2016 Apr 26.,De Rui M,Clin Nutr,2017,2016/05/09,,,10.1016/j.clnu.2016.04.011,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Aging is characterized by a loss of limb lean mass (LLM) that can lead to physical disability and death. Regional bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be a reliable method for estimating LLM, but no prediction equations are available for elderly Caucasian subjects. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a BIA-based equation for predicting LLM in healthy elderly Caucasians, taking dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 244 free-living healthy Caucasian subjects (117 men, 179 women) over 60 years of age were enrolled. LLM was measured with DXA (LLM<sub>DXA</sub>), and the resistance (Rz) and reactance (Xc) of each limb were measured with a regional bioelectrical impedance analyzer. A resistive index (RI) was calculated from stature in meters divided by Rz of each arm. A BIA-based multiple regression equation for predicting the lean mass (LM) of dominant and non-dominant limbs was developed using a double cross-validation technique.
RESULTS: Using the sample as a whole, cross-validation resulted in an equation specific for each limb, as follows, where sex equals 1 for males, and 0 for females: LM (kg) = -0.081 + (0.061*RI) + (0.010*body weight) + (0.299*sex) for the dominant arm; LM (kg) = -0.026 + (0.014*RI) + (0.009*body weight) + (0.352*sex) for the non-dominant arm; LM (kg) = -0.462 + (0.027*RI) + (0.047*body weight) + (0.639*sex) + (0.026*Xc) for the dominant leg; and for the non-dominant leg, LM (kg) = -0.522 + (0.029*RI) + (0.045*body weight) + (0.569*sex) + (0.025*Xc). The DXA-measured and BIA-predicted LLM for each limb did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSION: Our newly-developed BIA equations seem to provide a valid estimation of LLM in older Caucasian adults."

This study sought to investigate ChatGPT responses to common patient questions regarding Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).
METHODS: This was a prospective, multi-institutional study, with data collected from high volume institutions that perform >50 transoral robotic surgery cases per year. The 100 most recent discussion threads including the term ""HPV"" on the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors Network's Head and Neck Cancer public discussion board were reviewed. The 11 most common questions were serially queried to ChatGPT 3.5; answers were recorded. A survey was distributed to fellowship trained head and neck oncologic surgeons at 3 institutions to evaluate the responses.
RESULTS: A total of 8 surgeons participated in the study. For questions regarding HPV contraction and transmission, ChatGPT answers were scored as clinically accurate and aligned with consensus in the head and neck surgical oncology community 84.4% and 90.6% of the time, respectively. For questions involving treatment of HPV+ OPC, ChatGPT was clinically accurate and aligned with consensus 87.5% and 91.7% of the time, respectively. For questions regarding the HPV vaccine, ChatGPT was clinically accurate and aligned with consensus 62.5% and 75% of the time, respectively. When asked about circulating tumor DNA testing, only 12.5% of surgeons thought responses were accurate or consistent with consensus.
CONCLUSION: ChatGPT 3.5 performed poorly with questions involving evolving therapies and diagnostics-thus, caution should be used when using a platform like ChatGPT 3.5 to assess use of advanced technology. Patients should be counseled on the importance of consulting their surgeons to receive accurate and up to date recommendations, and use LLM's to augment their understanding of these important health-related topics."

We present here a shotgun lipidomics platform established to quantify 38 lipid classes belonging to four lipid categories present in mammalian samples and show the fine-tuning and comprehensive evaluation of its experimental parameters and performance. We first determined for all the targeted lipid classes the collision energy levels optimal for the recording of their lipid class- and species-specific fragment ions and fine-tuned the energy levels applied in the platform. We then performed a series of titrations to define the boundaries of linear signal response for the targeted lipid classes, and demonstrated that the dynamic quantification range spanned more than 3 orders of magnitude and reached sub picomole levels for 35 lipid classes. The platform identified 273, 261, and 287 lipid species in brain, plasma, and cultured fibroblast samples, respectively, at the respective optimal working sample amounts. The platform properly quantified the majority of these identified lipid species, while lipid species measured to be below the limit of quantification were efficiently removed from the data sets by the use of statistical analyses of data reproducibility or a cutoff threshold. Finally, we demonstrated that a series of parameters of cell culture conditions influence lipidomics outcomes, including confluency, medium supplements, and use of transfection reagents. The present study provides a guideline for setting up and using a simple and efficient platform for quantitatively exploring the mammalian lipidome."

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist by searching PubMed, Scopus and Embase from 1 January 2020 to 29 March 2021. Citation chasing was also performed. Studies with information about COVID-19 outbreaks originating in indoor places of worship of any religion were included.
RESULTS: A total of 9729 records were identified and 36 were selected. The articles reported 119 descriptions of outbreaks linked to churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples, referring to approximately 52-74 unique outbreaks. The outbreaks were mostly located in three major areas: East and Southeast Asia (46%), the USA (27%), Europe (22%). All the outbreaks began in 2020. Mainly, there were no restrictive measures, or such measures were not followed at the time of the outbreak. Choir practices presented the highest attack rate (up to 0.867).
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of preventive measures and the role of singing practices were highlighted. Reports were often lacking contact tracing and sometimes did not report the date of outbreak extinction. Moreover, reports came from few geographical areas. Thus, the impact of transmission in places of worship may be largely underestimated."

METHODS: Using NCCN Guidelines, we generated 10 questions and answers regarding management of ovarian cancer at a single point in time. Questions were thematically divided into risk factors, surgical management, medical management, and surveillance. We asked ChatGPT (GPT-4) to provide responses without prompting (unprompted GPT) and with prompt engineering (prompted GPT). Responses were blinded and evaluated for accuracy and completeness by 5 gynecologic oncologists. A score of 0 was defined as inaccurate, 1 as accurate and incomplete, and 2 as accurate and complete. Evaluations were compared among NCCN, unprompted GPT, and prompted GPT answers.
RESULTS: Overall, 48% of responses from NCCN, 64% from unprompted GPT, and 66% from prompted GPT were accurate and complete. The percentage of accurate but incomplete responses was higher for NCCN vs GPT-4. The percentage of accurate and complete scores for questions regarding risk factors, surgical management, and surveillance was higher for GPT-4 vs NCCN; however, for questions regarding medical management, the percentage was lower for GPT-4 vs NCCN. Overall, 14% of responses from unprompted GPT, 12% from prompted GPT, and 10% from NCCN were inaccurate.
CONCLUSIONS: GPT-4 provided accurate and complete responses at a single point in time to a limited set of questions regarding ovarian cancer, with best performance in areas of risk factors, surgical management, and surveillance. Occasional inaccuracies, however, should limit unsupervised use of chatbots at this time."

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was carried out from January 2017 to July 2017 after the 2016/2017 influenza vaccination campaign. The questionnaire was administered to all patients treated in seven large Italian dialysis services. It consisted of influenza vaccination coverage, knowledge about influenza and its vaccination, perceived risk of influenza complications, recommendations on influenza uptake received by general practitioner (GP) and nephrologist. Results: Response rate was 90% (703/781). Patients' knowledge about influenza infection and vaccine were detected by nine closed questions: 35.6% of responders answered correctly to ≥ 6 sentences, 47.5% of them reported that ""influenza vaccine can cause influenza"" and 45.7% believed that ""antibiotics are a correct strategy to treat influenza"". Levels of perceived risks of hospitalisation and death were low in 39.3% and 16.5% of patients respectively. The adherence to the last seasonal influenza vaccination was 57.5%. The multivariate predictors of influenza vaccination uptake resulted: age ≥65, male, consulting TV/radio, asking information to GP and/or nephrologist. Conclusions: The study reveals the low adherence to influenza vaccination and the subotpimal level of knowledge in dialysis patients. Different strategies, including a greater alliance among nephrologists and GPs to prevent influenza should be encouraged to improve the adherence to influenza vaccination in this at risk group."

METHODS AND RESULTS: The National Health Insurance database was used to identify all patients hospitalized for ACS in France in 2019 and those among them who received CR. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were described and compared between CR and non-CR patients. Poisson regression models were used to identify the impact of CR after adjusting for confounders. A Cox model was fitted to identify the variables related to mortality after adjustment for medication persistence and cardiologic follow-up. In 2019, 22% of 134 846 patients hospitalized for ACS in France received CR within 6 months of their discharge. After 1 year, only 60% of patients who did not receive CR were still taking BASI (combination of beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, statins, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors) drugs. This rate and the medical follow-up rate were higher in patients who received CR. Two years after the ACS event, patients who received CR had better medical follow-up and lower mortality risk, after adjusting for cofounding variables [adjusted hazard ratio all-cause mortality = 0.65 (0.61-0.69)]. After adjustment for the dispensing of cardiovascular drugs and cardiologic follow-up, the independent effect of CR was not as strong but remained significant [hazard ratio = 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.84-0.95)].
CONCLUSION: Patients who received CR after hospitalization for ACS had a better prognosis. Optimization of efficient secondary prevention strategies, improved medication persistence, and enhanced cardiologic follow-up seemed to play a major role."

Epub 2015 Sep 28.,Stahmeyer JT,J Viral Hepat,2016,2015/09/29,,,10.1111/jvh.12471,"Viral hepatitis is a major public health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the study was to assess outcomes and costs of treating patients with chronic hepatitis C in clinical practice in Germany. We carried out a prospective noninterventional study. Information on treatment outcomes, resource utilization and quality of life was provided by 281 physicians throughout Germany. Data of 3708 monoinfected HCV-patients treated between 2008 and 2011 were analysed. Therapy consisted of peginterferon/ribavirin. Mean age of patients was 43.7 years, 60.3% were male and estimated duration of infection was 13.6 years. Predominantly genotype 1 (61.3%) or 3 (28.5%) infections were observed. Sustained viral response (SVR)-rates in most frequently observed genotypes were 49.2% in GT-1 and 61.9% in GT-3 treatment-naive patients (Relapser: GT-1: 35.3% and GT-3: 57.3%; Nonresponder: GT-1: 25.0% and GT-3: 33.3%). Average treatment costs were lowest in treatment-naive patients (€18 965) and higher in patients who failed previous treatments (relapsers: €24 753; nonresponders: €19 511). Differences according to genotype were observed. Average costs per SVR in treatment-naive patients were €44 744 for GT-1 and €22 218 for GT-3. Treatment was associated with a decrease in quality of life; post-treatment quality of life was higher in patients achieving SVR. Our insight on real-life treatment outcomes and costs can serve as a reference for a comparison with other treatments. There is high need for short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis in real-life settings as newly introduced treatment strategies with direct acting antivirals result in high SVR-rates but are more costly."
39167785,Comparing GPT-4 and Human Researchers in Health Care Data Analysis: Qualitative Description Study,"Li KD, Fernandez AM, Schwartz R, Rios N, Carlisle MN, Amend GM, Patel HV, Breyer BN.",J Med Internet Res. 2024 Aug 21;26:e56500. doi: 10.2196/56500.,Li KD,J Med Internet Res,2024,2024/08/21,PMC11375389,,10.2196/56500,"BACKGROUND: Large language models including GPT-4 (OpenAI) have opened new avenues in health care and qualitative research. Traditional qualitative methods are time-consuming and require expertise to capture nuance. Although large language models have demonstrated enhanced contextual understanding and inferencing compared with traditional natural language processing, their performance in qualitative analysis versus that of humans remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of GPT-4 versus human researchers in qualitative analysis of interviews with patients with adult-acquired buried penis (AABP).
METHODS: Qualitative data were obtained from semistructured interviews with 20 patients with AABP. Human analysis involved a structured 3-stage process-initial observations, line-by-line coding, and consensus discussions to refine themes. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) analysis with GPT-4 underwent two phases: (1) a naïve phase, where GPT-4 outputs were independently evaluated by a blinded reviewer to identify themes and subthemes and (2) a comparison phase, where AI-generated themes were compared with human-identified themes to assess agreement. We used a general qualitative description approach.
RESULTS: The study population (N=20) comprised predominantly White (17/20, 85%), married (12/20, 60%), heterosexual (19/20, 95%) men, with a mean age of 58.8 years and BMI of 41.1 kg/m2. Human qualitative analysis identified ""urinary issues"" in 95% (19/20) and GPT-4 in 75% (15/20) of interviews, with the subtheme ""spray or stream"" noted in 60% (12/20) and 35% (7/20), respectively. ""Sexual issues"" were prominent (19/20, 95% humans vs 16/20, 80% GPT-4), although humans identified a wider range of subthemes, including ""pain with sex or masturbation"" (7/20, 35%) and ""difficulty with sex or masturbation"" (4/20, 20%). Both analyses similarly highlighted ""mental health issues"" (11/20, 55%, both), although humans coded ""depression"" more frequently (10/20, 50% humans vs 4/20, 20% GPT-4). Humans frequently cited ""issues using public restrooms"" (12/20, 60%) as impacting social life, whereas GPT-4 emphasized ""struggles with romantic relationships"" (9/20, 45%). ""Hygiene issues"" were consistently recognized (14/20, 70% humans vs 13/20, 65% GPT-4). Humans uniquely identified ""contributing factors"" as a theme in all interviews. There was moderate agreement between human and GPT-4 coding (κ=0.401). Reliability assessments of GPT-4's analyses showed consistent coding for themes including ""body image struggles,"" ""chronic pain"" (10/10, 100%), and ""depression"" (9/10, 90%). Other themes like ""motivation for surgery"" and ""weight challenges"" were reliably coded (8/10, 80%), while less frequent themes were variably identified across multiple iterations.
CONCLUSIONS: Large language models including GPT-4 can effectively identify key themes in analyzing qualitative health care data, showing moderate agreement with human analysis. While human analysis provided a richer diversity of subthemes, the consistency of AI suggests its use as a complementary tool in qualitative research. With AI rapidly advancing, future studies should iterate analyses and circumvent token limitations by segmenting data, furthering the breadth and depth of large language model-driven qualitative analyses."
39327587,Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of AI chatbots in disseminating the content of current resuscitation guidelines: a comparative analysis between the ERC 2021 guidelines and both ChatGPTs 3.5 and 4,"Beck S, Kuhner M, Haar M, Daubmann A, Semmann M, Kluge S.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med. 2024 Sep 26;32(1):95. doi: 10.1186/s13049-024-01266-2.,Beck S,Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,2024,2024/09/26,PMC11425874,,10.1186/s13049-024-01266-2,"AIM OF THE STUDY: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are established as tools for answering medical questions worldwide. Healthcare trainees are increasingly using this cutting-edge technology, although its reliability and accuracy in the context of healthcare remain uncertain. This study evaluated the suitability of Chat-GPT versions 3.5 and 4 for healthcare professionals seeking up-to-date evidence and recommendations for resuscitation by comparing the key messages of the resuscitation guidelines, which methodically set the gold standard of current evidence and recommendations, with the statements of the AI chatbots on this topic.
METHODS:  This prospective comparative content analysis was conducted between the 2021 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines and the responses of two freely available ChatGPT versions (ChatGPT-3.5 and the Bing version of the ChatGPT-4) to questions about the key messages of clinically relevant ERC guideline chapters for adults. (1) The content analysis was performed bidirectionally by independent raters. The completeness and actuality of the AI output were assessed by comparing the key message with the AI-generated statements. (2) The conformity of the AI output was evaluated by comparing the statements of the two ChatGPT versions with the content of the ERC guidelines.
RESULTS: In response to inquiries about the five chapters, ChatGPT-3.5 generated a total of 60 statements, whereas ChatGPT-4 produced 32 statements. ChatGPT-3.5 did not address 123 key messages, and ChatGPT-4 did not address 132 of the 172 key messages of the ERC guideline chapters. A total of 77% of the ChatGPT-3.5 statements and 84% of the ChatGPT-4 statements were fully in line with the ERC guidelines. The main reason for nonconformity was superficial and incorrect AI statements. The interrater reliability between the two raters, measured by Cohen's kappa, was greater for ChatGPT-4 (0.56 for completeness and 0.76 for conformity analysis) than for ChatGPT-3.5 (0.48 for completeness and 0.36 for conformity).
CONCLUSION: We advise healthcare professionals not to rely solely on the tested AI-based chatbots to keep up to date with the latest evidence, as the relevant texts for the task were not part of the training texts of the underlying LLMs, and the lack of conceptual understanding of AI carries a high risk of spreading misconceptions. Original publications should always be considered for comprehensive understanding."

Epub 2016 Feb 8.,Grosso A,Eur J Ophthalmol,2016,2016/02/13,,,10.5301/ejo.5000738,"PURPOSE: To survey the surgical routines with regards to prophylactic strategies in a sample of Italian hospitals and compare these with European Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ESCRS) guidelines.
METHODS: Six private and 18 public hospitals were included in this clinical-based retrospective study. The overall volume of cataract operations in the 24 centers in 2013 was 43,553. Main outcome measure was incidence of endophthalmitis per 1,000. An incidence of less than 0.13% was considered acceptable.
RESULTS: Our study provides the first Italian data on the use of intracameral antibiotics in cataract surgery as recommended by the ESCRS. Thirteen centers (54%) used intracameral cefuroxime at the end of surgery. Of the 13 centers that used cefuroxime, 8 (62%) had an incidence of endophthalmitis less than 0.13%. Of the 7 (29%) centers that did not use intracameral cefuroxime, all had an endophthalmitis rate of greater than 0.13%. This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Among the 4 centers not included, 2 used vancomycin in the infusion bottle, 1 a fluoroquinolone, and the last a combination of antibiotics. The majority of surgeons (71%) used preoperative antibiotic eyedrops, but this measure was not shown to be significantly protective.
CONCLUSIONS: Slightly more than half of the centers surveyed in this study adhered to the recommendations of the ESCRS and routinely employed prophylactic intracameral cefuroxime. An incidence of endophthalmitis greater than 0.13% was encountered significantly more frequently among centers that did not employ intracameral cefuroxime."

SETTING: Primary care in 16 countries (79 practices), when no routine SARS-CoV-2 testing was generally available.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Before (n=4376) and early in the pandemic (n=3301), patients with RTI symptoms were registered in this prospective audit study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Consultation characteristics (type of contact and use of PPE) and management characteristics (clinical assessments, diagnostic testing, prescribing, advice and referral) were registered. Differences in these characteristics between countries and between pandemic and prepandemic care are described.
RESULTS: Care for patients with RTIs rapidly switched to telephone/video consultations (10% in Armenia, 91% in Denmark), and when consultations were face-to-face, GPs used PPE during 97% (95% CI 96% to 98%) of contacts. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in primary care patients with RTIs was rapidly implemented in Denmark (59%) and Germany (31%), while overall testing for C reactive protein decreased. The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics varied considerably between countries (3% in Belgium, 48% in UK) and was lower during the pandemic compared with the months before, except for Greece, Poland and UK. GPs provided frequent and varied COVID-related advice and more frequently scheduled a follow-up contact (50%, 95% CI 48% to 52%). GPs reported a slightly higher degree of confidence in the likely effectiveness of their management in face-to-face (73% (very) confident, 95% CI 71% to 76%) than in virtual consultations (69%, 95% CI 67% to 71%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite between-country variation in consultation characteristics, access to SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing and medication prescribing, GPs reported a high degree of confidence in managing their patients with RTIs in the emerging pandemic. Insight in the highly variable pandemic responses, as measured in this multicountry audit, can aid in fine-tuning national action and in coordinating a pan-European response during future pandemic threats."

Here, we present the first systematic validation of SLR records as a basis for improved register quality and patient care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated timeliness and completeness of register records among patients diagnosed with lymphoma in the SLR (n = 16,905) compared with the National Cancer Register for the period 2013-2020. Comparability was assessed through evaluation of coding routines against national and international guidelines. Accuracy of 42 variables was evaluated through re-abstraction of data from medical records among 600 randomly selected patients diagnosed in 2016-2017 and treated across all six Swedish healthcare regions.  Results: Completeness was high, >95% per year for the period 2013-2018, and >89% for 2019-2020 compared to the National Cancer Register. One in four patients was registered within 3 months, and 89.9% within 2 years of diagnosis. Registration instructions and coding procedures followed the prespecified guidelines. Missingness was generally low (<5%), but high for occasional variables, for example, those describing maintenance and consolidative treatment. Exact agreement of categorical variables was high overall (>80% for 24/34 variables), especially for treatment-related data (>80% for 17/19 variables).
INTERPRETATION: Completeness and accuracy are high in the SLR, while timeliness could be improved. Finetuning of variable registration guided by this validation can further improve reliability of register reports and advance service to lymphoma patients and health care in the future."

The objective of this study is to determine the optimal alignment technique in TKA by comparing patient satisfaction, functional outcomes, implant survivorship, complications, and cost-effectiveness in MA TKA versus FA TKA. Robotic technology will be used to execute the planned implant positioning and limb alignment with high-levels of accuracy in all study patients.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective double-blinded randomised control trial will include 100 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary robotic arm-assisted TKA. Following informed consent, patients will be randomised to MA TKA (the control group) or FA TKA (the investigation group) at a ratio of 1:1 using an online random number generator. Blinded observers will review patients at regular intervals for 2 years after surgery to record predefined study outcomes relating to postoperative rehabilitation, clinical progress, functional outcomes, accuracy of implant positioning and limb alignment, gait, implant stability, cost-effectiveness, and complications. A superiority study design will be used to evaluate whether FA TKA provides superior outcomes compared to MA TKA. Primary and secondary objectives will be used to quantify and draw inferences on differences in the efficacy of treatment between the two groups. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol population analysis will be undertaken. The following statistical methods will be employed to analyse the data: descriptive statistics, independent t test, paired t test, analysis of variance, Fisher exact test, chi-square test, and graphical displays. Ethical approval was obtained from the London-Surrey Research Ethics Committee, UK. The study is sponsored by University College London, UK.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to describe the use of robotic technology to achieve FA TKA, and the only existing clinical trial comparing robotic MA TKA versus robotic FA TKA. The findings of this study will enable an improved understanding of the optimal alignment technique in TKA for achieving high-levels of patient satisfaction, improving functional outcomes, increasing implant survivorship, improving cost-effectiveness, and reducing complications.

The objective of our study was to provide an updated assessment of AMS programs operating in our region, and to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stewardship activities.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted to investigate AMS programs implemented in acute-care trusts participating in a broader healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) prevention and control program, promoted by the regional health department. Within this program, structure, process, and outcome indicators of AMS programs were investigated, using a previously developed scoring system. Differences between scores prior to (2019) and during the pandemic (2021) were assessed. Linear regression was used to assess whether the 5-year trends (2017-2021) in outcome measures in relation to structure and process scores were statistically significant. Compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for each outcome were calculated to illustrate changes in outcome rates over time.
RESULTS: All public trusts in the Region (20) and a small number of private institutions (3) provided data for this study. A modest, non-significant improvement was found for 2021 structure, process, and total scores compared to respective 2019 scores. A significant improvement was found concerning the definition of a formal mission statement, whereas significantly less trusts included monitoring adherence to antimicrobial policy or treatment guidelines in their programs. Overall consumption of antibiotics for systemic use saw an increase in 2021, with 2021 recording the highest median overall consumption compared to all previous years considered in this study. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteria (CRE) rates decreased over the 5-year period. Significant downwards trends in MRSA rates were identified for high-outlier structure and process groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest AMS programs in Piedmont were not set back following the pandemic. This outcome was possible thanks to well-established programs, coordinated within a regional framework. Continued efforts should be dedicated to supporting AMS programs and contrasting AMR, even when the focus is shifted towards other public health emergencies."

The environment's role in shaping an organism's phenotype has always intrigued us. Since the inception of humankind, twinning has existed with an unsettled parley on the contribution of nature (i.e. genetics) versus nurture (i.e. environment), which can influence the phenotypes. The study of twins measures the genetic contribution and that of the environmental influence for a particular trait, acting as a catalyst, fine-tuning the phenotypic trajectories. This is further evident because a number of human diseases show a spectrum of clinical manifestations with the same underlying molecular aberration. As of now, there is no definite way to conclude just from the genomic data the severity of a disease or even to predict who will get affected. This greatly justifies initiating a twin registry for a country as diverse and populated as India. There is an unmet need to set up a nationwide database to carefully curate the information on twins, serving as a valuable biorepository to study their overall susceptibility to disease. Establishing a twin registry is of paramount importance to harness the wealth of human information related to the biomedical, anthropological, cultural, social and economic significance."

Female is vulnerable to cholestatic type of HILI than male (21.1% vs 0.0%, P = .04). Of all the cases in HILI, using pure substance are more commonly seen than mixed substance (P = .02). In gender, male patients have higher alanine aminotransferase (GPT) (IU/L) level in HILI than female ones (1560 ± 819 vs 1047 ± 706, P = .03).In HILI, the female is more commonly seen than male, but less than male in the elderly. The pure substance more often happens to HILI than mixture substance. Female is predominant in the cholestatic type of HILI. The major prevalence of HILI is in Europe rather than Asia. HILI cases in Europe is 2.75-fold than in Asia. This could be due to fewer reports of the herb induced liver injury in Asia compared to Europe. Prevention of HILI is the best policy, because it needs to take 78 ± 59 days to recover."

Electronic health records (EHR) provide large quantities of data for such models, but conventional epidemiological approaches require significant researcher time to implement. Expert selection of variables, fine-tuning of variable transformations and interactions, and imputing missing values are time-consuming and could bias subsequent analysis, particularly given that missingness in EHR is both high, and may carry meaning. Using a cohort of 80,000 patients from the CALIBER programme, we compared traditional modelling and machine-learning approaches in EHR. First, we used Cox models and random survival forests with and without imputation on 27 expert-selected, preprocessed variables to predict all-cause mortality. We then used Cox models, random forests and elastic net regression on an extended dataset with 586 variables to build prognostic models and identify novel prognostic factors without prior expert input. We observed that data-driven models used on an extended dataset can outperform conventional models for prognosis, without data preprocessing or imputing missing values. An elastic net Cox regression based with 586 unimputed variables with continuous values discretised achieved a C-index of 0.801 (bootstrapped 95% CI 0.799 to 0.802), compared to 0.793 (0.791 to 0.794) for a traditional Cox model comprising 27 expert-selected variables with imputation for missing values. We also found that data-driven models allow identification of novel prognostic variables; that the absence of values for particular variables carries meaning, and can have significant implications for prognosis; and that variables often have a nonlinear association with mortality, which discretised Cox models and random forests can elucidate. This demonstrates that machine-learning approaches applied to raw EHR data can be used to build models for use in research and clinical practice, and identify novel predictive variables and their effects to inform future research."

However, LDL-C control remains generally insufficient, also in patients with hypertension. We analyzed Electronic Health Record (EHR) data of 7117 hypertensive patients to find the most potential age and sex subgroups in greatest need for improvement in real life dyslipidemia treatment. Taking into account the current discussion on lifetime CVD risk, we focused on the age dependence in LDL-C control.
METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study, based on routine electronic health record (EHR) data, we investigated LDL-C control of hypertensive, non-diabetic patients without renal dysfunction or CVD, aged 30 years or more in Finnish primary care setting.
RESULTS: More than half (54% of women and 53% of men) of untreated patients did not meet the LDL-C target of < 3 mmol/l and one third (35% of women and 33% of men) of patients did not reach the target even with the lipid-lowering medication (LLM). Furthermore, higher age was strongly associated with better LDL-C control (p < 0.001) and lower LDL-C level (p < 0.001) in individuals with and without LLM. Higher age was also strongly associated with LLM prescription (p < 0.001). In total, about half of the patients were on LLM (53% of women and 51% of men).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that dyslipidemia treatment among Finnish primary care hypertensive patients is generally insufficient, particularly in younger age groups who might benefit the most from CVD risk reduction over time. Clinicians should probably rely more on the lifetime risk of CVD, especially when treating working age hypertensive patients."

We investigated this issue in a cohort of 232,278 patients admitted in five years (2011-2015) to 163 Italian general ICUs.
METHODS: Surgical patients older than 75 registered in the GiViTI MargheritaPROSAFE project were analyzed. The impact on hospital mortality of important chronic conditions (severe COPD, NYHA class IV, dementia, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis with portal hypertension) was investigated with two prognostic models developed yearly on patients staying in the ICU less or more than 24 hours.
RESULTS: 44,551 elderly patients (19.2%) underwent emergency (47.3%) or elective surgery (52.7%). At least one severe comorbidity was present in 14.6% of them, yielding a higher hospital mortality (32.4%, vs. 21.1% without severe comorbidity). In the models for patients staying in the ICU 24 hours or more, cirrhosis, NYHA class IV, and severe COPD were constant independent predictors of death (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] range 1.67-1.97, 1.54-1.91, and 1.34-1.50, respectively), while dementia was statistically significant in four out of five models (adjusted ORs 1.23-1.28). End-stage renal disease, instead, never resulted to be an independent prognostic factor. For patients staying in the ICU less than 24 hours, chronic comorbidities were only occasionally independent predictors of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that elderly surgical patients represent a relevant part of all ICUs admissions. About one of seven bear at least one severe chronic comorbidity, that, excluding end-stage renal disease, are all strong independent predictors of hospital death."

Determining the most effective inhibitor for each mutational profile is a major challenge for MET-driven cancer treatment in precision medicine. Here, we used a deep mutational scan (DMS) of ∼5,764 MET kinase domain variants to profile the growth of each mutation against a panel of 11 inhibitors that are reported to target the MET kinase domain. We validate previously identified resistance mutations, pinpoint common resistance sites across type I, type II, and type I ½ inhibitors, unveil unique resistance and sensitizing mutations for each inhibitor, and verify non-cross-resistant sensitivities for type I and type II inhibitor pairs. We augment a protein language model with biophysical and chemical features to improve the predictive performance for inhibitor-treated datasets. Together, our study demonstrates a pooled experimental pipeline for identifying resistance mutations, provides a reference dictionary for mutations that are sensitized to specific therapies, and offers insights for future drug development."

Epub 2015 Jul 26.,Singh AK,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,2015,2015/08/31,,,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.07.052,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to assess the benefits of a left internal thoracic artery as a bypass conduit in octogenarians undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. We hypothesize that there is no survival advantage and that outcome may be gender related.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 1141 octogenarians (aged >80 years) undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 1996 to 2012, patients were divided into 2 groups: Group I (coronary artery bypass grafting-left internal thoracic artery) included 870 patients (339 female/531 male), and group II (coronary artery bypass grafting-saphenous vein graft) included 271 patients (131 female/140 male).
RESULTS: The overall 30-day mortality was 5.7%: 4.3% in group I and 7.0% in group II (P = .1). Group II had a lower trend of any postoperative complication (P = .05) and pneumonia (P = .05). When analyzed by gender, there were no discernable differences in long-term survival for male patients in group I (65% at 5 years and 29% at 10 years) versus male patients in group II (65% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years) (P = .2). However, survival was significantly greater for female patients in group I (70% at 5 years and 35% at 10 years) versus female patients in group II (63% at 5 years and 21% at 19 years) (P = .01). Multiple logistic and Cox regression analysis showed that left internal thoracic artery use is associated with improved survival in female patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.93) but not in male patients (HR, 1.14; CI, 0.9-1.4). Advanced age was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR, 1.08 per year; CI, 1.05-1.1). Both patient age (P = .01) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons-predicted 30-day mortality (P = .03) remain in the final model for 30-day mortality. The benefit of the left internal thoracic artery after coronary artery bypass grafting in octogenarians may be gender related.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the benefit of the left internal thoracic artery in the octogenarian population undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting may be gender related. For elderly female patients, the use of the left internal thoracic artery as a bypass conduit was associated with better long-term survival, whereas no significant difference was found among the male population. The use of the left internal thoracic artery was associated with a greater postoperative pulmonary morbidity for the study population as a whole. The present study does not refute the benefit of the left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending graft, but instead distinguishes a subset who might benefit more."

We compared the effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy regimens.
METHODS: We searched the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry for patients with newly diagnosed advanced lung SCC from 2004 to 2007. Medication prescription data were retrieved from the database of National Health Insurance, Taiwan. We identified patients who received standard first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, which was defined as chemotherapy with a platinum (P) compound (cisplatin or carboplatin) in addition to 1 of the 4 chemotherapy agents, including gemcitabine (G), docetaxel (D), paclitaxel (T), and vinorelbine (V). Deaths were identified by searching the National Death Registry. Overall survival (OS) was compared between patients who underwent different therapies.
RESULTS: In total, 2790 patients were identified; 983 patients (35.2%) received standard first-line chemotherapy with P and G (58.1%), D (14.5%), T (11.6%), or V (15.8%). Older patients (age ≥ 70 years) were less likely to receive P + D than P + G, P + T, or P + V (P = .018). Patients who received P + G, P + D, P + T, or P + V had similar OS (median, 8.9, 7.9, 9.5, and 8.2 months; P = .816). In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, and stage, the first-line chemotherapy regimen was not a predictor for OS. With P + G as the reference group, the adjusted hazard ratios of P + D, P + T, and P + V were 1.03, 0.90, and 1.02, respectively (P = .710).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced lung SCC, various regimens did not have a significant effect on survival outcomes."

Epub 2019 Apr 4.,Manceau G,Colorectal Dis,2019,2019/03/19,,,10.1111/codi.14614,"AIM: The aim was to define risk factors for postoperative mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery for obstructing colon cancer (OCC) and to propose a dedicated score.
METHOD: From 2000 to 2015, 2325 patients were treated for OCC in French surgical centres by members of the French National Surgical Association. A multivariate analysis was performed for variables with P value ≤ 0.20 in the univariate analysis for 30-day mortality. Predictive performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: A total of 1983 patients were included. Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 7%. Multivariate analysis found five significant independent risk factors: age ≥ 75 (P = 0.013), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ III (P = 0.027), pulmonary comorbidity (P = 0.0002), right-sided cancer (P = 0.047) and haemodynamic failure (P < 0.0001). The odds ratio for risk of postoperative death was 3.42 with one factor, 5.80 with two factors, 15.73 with three factors, 29.23 with four factors and 77.25 with five factors. The discriminating capacity in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality was 0.80.
CONCLUSION: Thirty-day postoperative mortality after emergency surgery for OCC is correlated with age, ASA score, pulmonary comorbidity, site of tumour and haemodynamic failure, with a specific score ranging from 0 to 5."

In this prospective, observational study we screened 320 consecutive surgical/medical ICU patients for anti-PF4/H antibodies by enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) for immunoglobulin (Ig)G/A/M separately and heparin-induced platelet activation assay (HIPA) at ICU admission (=baseline), day 6, and day 10. HIPA-positive patients were additionally tested by serotonin-release assay (SRA). Patients tested positive by day 10: for anti-PF4/H-IgG = 17.2 % and for anti-PF4/H-IgM = 42.1 %. Within the first 10 ICU days, platelet counts decreased to <100 Gpt/L in 27.8 % patients. However, only seven patients (2.2 %) experienced a drop in the platelet count ≥50 % beginning after the fourth ICU day. These included the only two patients (0.6 %; 95 % confidence interval 0.08-2.2 %) with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Only strong reactions in the HIPA were reproducible by SRA. This study confirms that testing for anti-PF4/H IgG antibodies should be restricted to ICU-patients who develop a platelet count decrease of >50 % that begins after day four of heparin treatment (which may have started before ICU admission). Among patients testing positive by IgG-specific EIA a functional platelet activation assay should be performed (regarding only strong reactions as positive)."

The kinetics, magnitude and landscape of the antibody response may impact the clinical severity and serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive investigation of the antibody landscape in children and adults is needed.
METHODS: We tested 254 plasma from 122 children with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Hong Kong up to 206 days post symptom onset, including 146 longitudinal samples from 58 children. Adult COVID-19 patients and pre-pandemic controls were included for comparison. We assessed antibodies to a 14-wide panel of SARS-CoV-2 structural and accessory proteins by Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS).
FINDINGS: Children have lower levels of Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies than adults, and their cumulative humoral response is more expanded to accessory proteins (NSP1 and Open Reading Frames (ORFs)). Sensitive serology using the three N, ORF3b, ORF8 antibodies can discriminate COVID-19 in children. Principal component analysis revealed distinct serological signatures in children and the highest contribution to variance were responses to non-structural proteins ORF3b, NSP1, ORF7a and ORF8. Longitudinal sampling revealed maintenance or increase of antibodies for at least 6 months, except for ORF7b antibodies which showed decline. It was interesting to note that children have higher antibody responses towards known IFN antagonists: ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF7a. The diversified SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in children may be an important factor in driving control of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Novel interactive modalities, such as large language model (LLM)-enhanced social robotic VPs might increase interactivity and authenticity in CR skill practice. To evaluate medical students' perceptions of CR training using an LLM-enhanced social robotic VP platform compared with a conventional computer-based VP platform. A qualitative study involved 23 third-year medical students from Karolinska Institutet, who completed VP cases on an LLM-enhanced social robotic platform and a computer-based semi-linear platform. In-depth interviews assessed students' self-perceived acquirement of CR skills using the two platforms. Thematic analysis was employed to identify themes and sub-themes. Three main themes were identified: authenticity, VP application, and strengths and limitations. Students found the social robotic platform more authentic and engaging. It enabled highly interactive communication and expressed emotions, collectively offering a realistic experience. It facilitated active learning, hypothesis generation, and adaptive thinking. Limitations included lack of physical examination options and, occasionally, mechanical dialogue. The LLM-enhanced social robotic VP platform offers a more authentic and interactive learning experience compared to the conventional computer-based platform. Despite some limitations, it shows promise in training CR skills, communication, and adaptive thinking. Social robotic VPs may prove useful and safe learning environments for exposing medical students to diverse, highly interactive patient simulations."

Targeted agents have demonstrated activity across multiple cancer types. BRE12-158 was a phase II, multicenter trial that randomly allocated patients with TNBC with residual disease after NAC to genomically directed therapy versus treatment of physician choice (TPC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2014 to December 2018, 193 patients were enrolled. Residual tumors were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing test. A molecular tumor board adjudicated all results. Patients were randomly allocated to four cycles of genomically directed therapy (arm A) versus TPC (arm B). Patients without a target were assigned to arm B. Primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) among randomly assigned patients. Secondary/exploratory end points included distant disease-free survival, overall survival, toxicity assessment, time-based evolution of therapy, and drug-specific outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three patients were randomly allocated or were assigned to arm B. The estimated 2-year DFS for the randomized population only was 56.6% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70) for arm A versus 62.4% (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75) for arm B. No difference was seen in DFS, distant disease-free survival, or overall survival for the entire or randomized populations. There was increased uptake of capecitabine for TPC over time. Patients randomly allocated later had less distant recurrences. Circulating tumor DNA status remained a significant predictor of outcome with some patients demonstrating clearance with postneoadjuvant therapy.
CONCLUSION: Genomically directed therapy was not superior to TPC for patients with residual TNBC after NAC. Capecitabine should remain the standard of care; however, the activity of other agents in this setting provides rationale for testing optimal combinations to improve outcomes. Circulating tumor DNA should be considered a standard covariate for trials in this setting."

There is no consensus regarding the need for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy when regression is present within the primary tumor.
OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence that regression may affect SLN status.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was performed by searching in MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from January 1, 1990, through June 2014.
STUDY SELECTION: All studies that reported an odds ratio (OR) or data on expected and observed cases of SLN positivity and histologic regression were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Primary random-effects meta-analyses were used to summarize ORs of SLN positivity and histologic regression. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 test and I2 statistic. To assess the potential bias of small studies, we used funnel plots, the Begg rank correlation test, and the Egger weighted linear regression test. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed according to the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist, and 2 different meta-analyses were performed based on those criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Summary ORs of histologic regression of primary melanoma and SLN status.
RESULTS: Of the 1509 citations found in the search, 94 articles were reviewed, and 14 studies comprising 10 098 patients were included in the analysis. In the combined 14 studies, patients with regression had a lower likelihood to have SLN positivity (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.77) than patients without regression. On the basis of study quality, we found that patients with regression enrolled in high-quality studies had a lower likelihood to have SLN positivity (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.32-0.72) compared with results of low-quality studies (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00). Examination of the funnel plot did not provide evidence of publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this analysis showed that the risk of SLN positivity was significantly lower in patients with histologic regression compared with those without. Regression may be used in these cases to make a selection of which patients should be the most appropriate for this procedure."

Our objective was to compare the performance of unsupervised representations of sequences of disease codes generated by bag-of-words versus sequence-based NLP algorithms at predicting clinically relevant outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study used primary care EHRs from 6 286 233 people with Multiple Long-Term Conditions in England. For each patient, an unsupervised vector representation of their time-ordered sequences of diseases was generated using 2 input strategies (212 disease categories versus 9462 diagnostic codes) and different NLP algorithms (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, doc2vec, and 2 transformer models designed for EHRs). We also developed a transformer architecture, named EHR-BERT, incorporating sociodemographic information. We compared the performance of each of these representations (without fine-tuning) as inputs into a logistic classifier to predict 1-year mortality, healthcare use, and new disease diagnosis.
RESULTS: Patient representations generated by sequence-based algorithms performed consistently better than bag-of-words methods in predicting clinical endpoints, with the highest performance for EHR-BERT across all tasks, although the absolute improvement was small. Representations generated using disease categories perform similarly to those using diagnostic codes as inputs, suggesting models can equally manage smaller or larger vocabularies for prediction of these outcomes.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patient representations produced by sequence-based NLP algorithms from sequences of disease codes demonstrate improved predictive content for patient outcomes compared with representations generated by co-occurrence-based algorithms. This suggests transformer models may be useful for generating multi-purpose representations, even without fine-tuning."

METHODS: A retrospective and observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with HBeAg(-) chronic infection (2005-2012). A normal GPT cut-off value at diagnosis that predicts abnormal GPT values in the clinical course of the infection, a baseline HBV-DNA cut-off value that predicts an increase in HBV-DNA above 2,000IU/ml, and GPT and HBV-DNA as predictors of the need for treatment were investigated using ROC curves.
RESULTS: 126 patients were enrolled (follow-up: 42.1±21.5months), 93 of which had normal GPT levels at diagnosis. In the ROC curve analysis, 900IU/ml was found to be the HBV-DNA cut-off value that best predicted this value's increase above 2,000IU/ml (sensitivity: 90%; specificity: 88%; PPV: 79%; NPV: 100%; diagnostic precision: 89%), while 25mU/ml was the normal GPT cut-off value at diagnosis that best predicted subsequently elevated GPT levels (sensitivity: 95.4%; specificity: 81.6%; PPV: 67%; NPV: 96%; diagnostic precision: 80.6%).

The combined GPT and HBV-DNA values that elicited the highest treatment need were 38mU/ml of GPT and 6,000IU/ml of HBV-DNA (sensitivity: 75%; specificity: 93.4%; PPV: 60%; NPV: 96.6%).
CONCLUSION: HBeAg(-) patients with GPT<25mU/ml and HBV-DNA<900IU/ml at diagnosis have positive outcomes and may not require such stringent follow-up in the first years after diagnosis."

Results from an Italian multicenter study,"Scaioli G, Bert F, Galis V, Brusaferro S, De Vito E, La Torre G, Manzoli L, Messina G, Torregrossa MV, Ricciardi W, Gualano MR, Siliquini R.",Public Health. 2015 Sep;129(9):1258-66. doi: 10.1016/j.puhe.2015.06.012. Epub 2015 Jul 22.,Scaioli G,Public Health,2015,2015/07/27,,,10.1016/j.puhe.2015.06.012,"OBJECTIVES: Since the new millennium, the number of e-health users has significantly increased. Among these, a particular category of people who are interested by this phenomenon is the one of pregnant women. The aim of the present study is to assess the sociodemographic and geographic differences existing in a sample of Italian pregnant women who search for information on the web.
STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: The present study has been conducted from November 2011 to September 2012, in seven Italian cities, located in the North, in the Centre and in the South of Italy. Data were collected through an anonymous questionnaire, administered in waiting rooms of outpatient departments by trained medical doctors. Data were analysed through multivariate logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Overall, 1347 responders were interviewed. Eighty-six percent of them declared to surf the internet to retrieve pregnancy-related information. The most searched topics were fetal development (51.3%), healthy lifestyle during pregnancy (48.7%), physiology of pregnancy (39.8%), generic and specific tips/advices during pregnancy (37.2%) and lactation (36.8%). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) according to geographic origin, age and educational level were found with regard to the most frequently searched information on the Web, the reasons that pushed pregnant women to practice e-health, and the possibility to change lifestyles after e-health.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the phenomenon of pregnancy e-health is widespread and show social and geographic differences, in particular about city of residence, age and educational level. It might encourage healthcare professionals to be more available and exhaustive during routine visits and to be more careful about web content on this topic, also addressing the different needs into different geographic contexts."

Moreover, since red lentil is dehulled prior to consumption, an opportunity exists at this point to fortify lentil with Fe. Thus, in the present study, lentil was Fe-fortified (using a fortificant Fe concentration of 2800 µg g-1) and used in 30 traditional Bangladeshi meals with broad differences in concentrations of iron, phytic acid (PA), and relative Fe bioavailability (RFeB%). Fortification with NaFeEDTA increased the iron concentration in lentil from 60 to 439 µg g-1 and resulted in a 79% increase in the amount of available Fe as estimated by Caco-2 cell ferritin formation. Phytic acid levels were reduced from 6.2 to 4.6 mg g-1 when fortified lentil was added, thereby reducing the PA:Fe molar ratio from 8.8 to 0.9. This effect was presumably due to dephytinization of fortified lentil during the fortification process. A significant (p ≤ 0.01) Pearson correlation was observed between Fe concentration and RFeB% and between RFeB% and PA:Fe molar ratio in meals with fortified lentil, but not for the meal with unfortified lentil. In conclusion, fortified lentil can contribute significant bioavailable Fe to populations at risk of Fe deficiency."

METHODS: Multicentre cross-sectional study (2018). Students were enrolled through convenience sampling (sample size=2513). Questionnaires included socio-demographic items and Beck Depression Inventory-II, which has an item on SI. A multivariable regression was performed (p-value<0.05 significant).
RESULTS: SI prevalence was 13.7%. Among students with and without depression SI prevalence was 36.0% and 4.3%. Being female, being in a relationship, good/excellent family cohesion, perceived good economic status were significantly associated with lower SI. Increasing age, bisexual/asexual orientation, psychiatric family history, negative judgment on medical school choice, competitive/hostile climate and unsatisfying friendships among classmates, being worried about not measuring up to the profession significantly increased SI.
CONCLUSION: There was a high SI prevalence among Italian medical students, consistently with worldwide data. Demographic, relational, and motivational factors seem to influence SI. Determinants should be further investigated to plan university-level interventions."

Depending on the extent of involvement, treatment can be either expectant or surgical. Prognosis and survival have been controversial, with some results supporting early surgical management. This research aims to disclose the outcomes and describe the management, clinical and imaging characteristics of patients diagnosed with Scimitar Syndrome treated in a tertiary referral healthcare center. Longitudinal descriptive observational study. The study included all patients diagnosed with scimitar syndrome in our institution between January/2011 and December/2022. A description of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, diagnostic tools used, treatment features, and patient outcomes is provided. Eleven patients were included, with a mean age at diagnosis of five years (CI 0-17), six of which were female (54.55%). Nine (81.82%) patients had evidence of a scimitar vein on the chest radiograph, six (54.55%) cardiac dextroposition, six (54.55%) pulmonary hypoplasia, five (45.45%) right pulmonary artery hypoplasia, and three (27.27%) had aortopulmonary collaterals. Four (36.36%) patients had horseshoe lungs, and four (36.36%) had bronchopulmonary sequestration. In the associations, two (18.18%) patients were found to have an atrial septal defect, three (27.27%) ventricular septal defect, and one (9%) had Tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary hypertension was demonstrated in two (18.18%) patients. Seven (63.64%) required surgical management to correct the scimitar vein, and two patients died due to unrelated complications. Scimitar syndrome presents diagnostic and treatment challenges, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for timely care. Chest radiography and CT scans are primary diagnostic tools, with surgical intervention often warranted alongside other heart defects or significant hemodynamic repercussions. Medical management is effective for mild to moderate cases. Long-term patient outcomes remain uncertain due to study limitations, but improved life expectancy is anticipated with ongoing care."

Epub 2017 Dec 14.,Stienen S,Circulation,2018,2017/12/16,,,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.029882,"BACKGROUND: The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.
RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of &gt;30% (80% versus 64%, P=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.37; P=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, P=0.39). Guided therapy also did not significantly improve any of the secondary end points.
CONCLUSIONS: The PRIMA II trial (Can NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP reduction of >30% after clinical stabilization did not improve 6-month outcomes.

Office-based flexible laryngoscopic biopsy (FLB) offers an alternative, but the effect on oncological outcome remains uncertain. Therefore, the diagnostic process and survival of patients undergoing FLB, compared to those undergoing DE-GA were evaluated.
METHODS: Patients suspected of laryngopharyngeal cancer who underwent FLB were evaluated. Patients with FLB-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were matched with DE-GA patients based on tumor site, T-classification, N-classification, age, and p16 overexpression. Time from first visit to diagnosis (FVD), time to treatment interval (TTI), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: FLB yielded a definitive diagnosis in 155/164 (95 %) patients. No complications were observed. Ninety-eight of the 124 patients in which FLB revealed a SCC received curative treatment and were compared with 98 matched patients who underwent DE-GA. Median FVD interval was 6 days after FLB and 15 days after DE-GA (p < 0.001). Median TTI interval (FLB: 28 days, DE-GA: 28 days) was equal (p = 0.91). Oncological outcomes were comparable (p > 0.05) between FLB (OS: 2-yr: 76 %, 5-yr: 42 %; DSS: 2-yr: 86 %, 5-yr: 85 %) and DE-GA groups (OS: 2-yr: 76 %, 5-yr: 50 %; DSS: 2-yr: 81 %, 5-yr: 79 %).
CONCLUSION: FLB in the outpatient setting demonstrates a high diagnostic accuracy, is safe, accelerates the diagnostic process and has no negative effects on clinical outcome compared to DE-GA. Therefore, FLB should be considered as the standard diagnostic procedure in patients suspected of laryngopharyngeal cancer."

We have summarized the evidence on asthma trends, environmental determinants, and long-term impacts while comparing these epidemiological features across childhood asthma and adult asthma. While asthma incidence and prevalence are higher in children, morbidity, and mortality are higher in adults. Childhood asthma is more common in boys while adult asthma is more common in women, and the reversal of this sex difference in prevalence occurs around puberty suggesting sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of asthma. The global epidemic of asthma that has been observed in both children and adults is still continuing, especially in low to middle income countries, although it has subsided in some developed countries. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct asthma phenotypes, and endotypes need to be adequately characterized to develop more accurate and meaningful definitions for use in research and clinical settings. This may be facilitated by new clustering techniques such as latent class analysis, and computational phenotyping methods are being developed to retrieve information from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to assist in the early diagnosis of asthma. While some important environmental determinants that trigger asthma are well-established, more work is needed to define the role of environmental exposures in the development of asthma in both children and adults. There is increasing evidence that investigation into possible gene-by-environment and environment-by-environment interactions may help to better uncover the determinants of asthma. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the interrelationship between environmental and genetic determinants to identify high risk groups and key modifiable exposures. For children, asthma may impair airway development and reduce maximally attained lung function, and these lung function deficits may persist into adulthood without additional progressive loss. Adult asthma may accelerate lung function decline and increase the risk of fixed airflow obstruction, with the effect of early onset asthma being greater than late onset asthma. Therefore, in managing asthma, our focus going forward should be firmly on improving not only short-term symptoms, but also the long-term respiratory and other health outcomes."

METHODS: Taking randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of T2DM in TCM as the research theme, we searched for full-text literature in three major clinical databases, including CNKI, Wan Fang, and VIP, published between 1990 and 2020. We then conducted frequency statistics, cluster analysis, association rules extraction, and topic modeling based on a corpus of medical academic words extracted from 3,654 research articles.
RESULTS: The TCM syndrome types, subjective symptoms, objective indicators, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture points, and TCM prescriptions for T2DM were compiled based on invigorating the kidney and Qi, nourishing Yin, and strengthening the spleen. Most TCM syndrome differentiation for T2DM was identified as ""Zhongxiao"" (the lesion in the spleen and stomach) and ""Xiaxiao"" (the lesion in the kidney) deficiency syndromes, and most medications and acupoint therapies were focused on the ""Spleen Channel"" and ""Kidney Channel."" However, stagnation of liver Qi was mentioned less when compared with other syndromes, which did not have symptomatic medicines.
CONCLUSION: This study provides an in-depth perspective for the TCM syndrome differentiation, medication rules, and acupoint therapy for T2DM and provides practitioners and researchers with valuable information about the current status and frontier trends of TCM research on T2DM in terms of both diagnosis and treatment."

However, the use of ketamine and/or its analogues, as well as combinations with other drugs, can be fatal.Objective: To outline the cases of overdoses and deaths related to the use of ketamine and/or its analogues, as reported in the scientific literature. To investigate if ketamine is safe in a therapeutic context, particularly in its use as an antidepressant.Methods: Electronic searches were performed on three medical databases. Articles describing cases of overdose and/or death associated with ketamine and/or its analogues were included. After the removal of duplicates, title analysis and full-text analysis, 34 articles were included in this review.Results: Eighteen articles described fatal cases and sixteen described overdoses. Poly-substance use was mentioned in 53% of the selected articles. Most cases were males and the ages varied from two to 65 years old. A total of 312 overdose cases and 138 deaths were reported. In both death reports and overdose cases, ketamine was preponderant: 89.1% and 79%, respectively. No cases of overdose or death related to the use of ketamine as an antidepressant in a therapeutic setting were found; most of the deaths occurred in the circumstances of polydrug use and overdoses left no sequelae.Conclusion: There is legitimate concern about the risks involving the use of ketamine and its analogues, especially in recreational settings. On the other hand, ketamine as medicine is considered safe and it is listed as an essential medicine by the World Health Organization. Although clinicians must remain vigilant, this should not deter appropriate prescription."

Epub 2019 Aug 16.,Guetterman TC,BMJ Qual Saf,2019,2019/08/18,,,10.1136/bmjqs-2019-009487,"BACKGROUND: Good outcomes for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) depend on a skilled resuscitation team, prompt initiation of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, and organisational structures to support IHCA response. We examined the role of nurses in resuscitation, contrasting higher versus lower performing hospitals in IHCA survival.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive qualitative study at nine hospitals in the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry, purposefully sampling hospitals that varied in geography, academic status, and risk-standardised IHCA survival. We conducted 158 semistructured interviews with nurses, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, quality improvement staff, and administrators. Qualitative thematic text analysis followed by type-building text analysis identified distinct nursing roles in IHCA care and support for roles.
RESULTS: Nurses played three major roles in IHCA response: bedside first responder, resuscitation team member, and clinical or administrative leader. We found distinctions between higher and lower performing hospitals in support for nurses. Higher performing hospitals emphasised training and competency of nurses at all levels; provided organisational flexibility and responsiveness with nursing roles; and empowered nurses to operate at a higher scope of clinical practice (eg, bedside defibrillation). Higher performing hospitals promoted nurses as leaders-administrators supporting nurses in resuscitation care at the institution, resuscitation team leaders during resuscitation and clinical champions for resuscitation care. Lower performing hospitals had more restrictive nurse roles with less emphasis on systematically identifying improvement needs.
CONCLUSION: Hospitals that excelled in IHCA survival emphasised mentoring and empowering front-line nurses and ensured clinical competency and adequate nursing training for IHCA care. Though not proof of causation, nurses appear to be critical to effective IHCA response, and how to support their role to optimise outcomes warrants further investigation."

Epub 2023 Dec 12.,Romandini P,J Clin Periodontol,2024,2023/12/12,,,10.1111/jcpe.13910,"AIM: The epidemiological relationship between periodontitis and caries remains controversial, and evidence synthesis is currently lacking. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to answer the following PECO question: 'In human adults (P), do subjects suffering from periodontitis (E) have higher presence/number of untreated carious lesions and caries experience (O) than subjects not suffering from periodontitis (C)?'.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational studies that met specific inclusion criteria established to answer to the PECO question were included. Two review authors independently searched for eligible studies, screened the titles and abstracts, carried out the full text analysis, extracted the data and performed the risk of bias assessment. In case of disagreement, a third review author took the final decision during ad hoc consensus meetings. Data synthesis was carried out through random-effects meta-analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 18 studies on 21 cohorts, involving 135,018 participants, were included. Meta-analyses showed a significant association between periodontitis and the presence of at least one tooth with either untreated carious lesions (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-2.01; p &lt;.00; I2  = 83.0%) or caries experience (decayed and filled teeth ≥ 1) (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.01-1.59; p = .038; I2  = 90.0%). Moreover, subjects with periodontitis exhibited a higher number of surfaces (difference in means [MD] = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.46-1.27; p &lt;.001; I2  = 0.0%) and teeth (MD = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.28-0.42; p &lt;.001; I2  = 69.6%) with untreated carious lesions, as well as a higher number of teeth with caries experience (standardized difference in means  [SMD] = 1.46; 95% CI: 0.15-2.78; p = .029; I2  = 98.9%) compared with those without periodontitis. Sensitivity analyses focusing on severe periodontitis as exposure mostly showed consistent results. Estimates for caries experience were only slightly attenuated in adjusted models compared with crude models. Subgroup analyses by caries location also indicated that periodontitis was associated only with root caries, while it was not with caries affecting the anatomical crown.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was found to be associated with the presence and number of treated/untreated root carious lesions. Therefore, caries-specific preventive measures (e.g., fluorides) should be considered for individuals with periodontitis."

However, there are no global prevalence estimates of syphilis among MSM to serve as a baseline for monitoring or modelling disease burden. We aimed to assess the global prevalence of syphilis among MSM using the available literature.
METHODS: In this global systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and AIM databases, and Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) reports between April 23, 2019, and Feb 1, 2020, to identify studies done between Jan 1, 2000, and Feb 1, 2020, with syphilis point prevalence data measured by biological assay among MSM (defined as people who were assigned as male at birth and had oral or anal sex with at least one other man in their lifetime). Studies were excluded if participants were exclusively HIV-infected MSM, injection-drug users, only seeking care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or genital symptoms, or routine STI clinic attendees. Data were extracted onto standardised forms and cross-checked for accuracy and validity. We used random-effects models to generate pooled prevalence estimates across the eight regions of the Sustainable Development Goals. We calculated risk of study bias based on the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies, and stratified results based on low versus high risk of bias. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019144594.
FINDINGS: We reviewed 4339 records, 228 IBBS reports, and ten articles from other sources. Of these, 1301 duplicate records were excluded, 2467 records were excluded after title and abstract screening, and 534 articles were excluded after full-text analysis. We identified 345 prevalence data points from 275 studies across 77 countries, with a total of 606 232 participants. Global pooled prevalence from 2000-20 was 7·5% (95% CI 7·0-8·0%), ranging from 1·9% (1·0-3·1%) in Australia and New Zealand to 10·6% (8·5-12·9%) in Latin America and the Caribbean.
INTERPRETATION: Unacceptably high syphilis prevalence among MSM warrants urgent action.

30371961,Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia,"Richter B, Hemmingsen B, Metzendorf MI, Takwoingi Y.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 Oct 29;10(10):CD012661. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012661.pub2.,Richter B,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2018,2018/10/30,PMC6516891,,10.1002/14651858.CD012661.pub2,"BACKGROUND: Intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) is characterised by one or more measurements of elevated blood glucose concentrations, such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These levels are higher than normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reduced threshold of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for defining IFG, introduced by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003, substantially increased the prevalence of IFG. Likewise, the lowering of the HbA1c threshold from 6.0% to 5.7% by the ADA in 2010 could potentially have significant medical, public health and socioeconomic impacts.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM, regression from IH to normoglycaemia and the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ClincialTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal up to December 2016 and updated the MEDLINE search in February 2018. We used several complementary search methods in addition to a Boolean search based on analytical text mining.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective cohort studies investigating the development of T2DM in people with IH. We used standard definitions of IH as described by the ADA or World Health Organization (WHO). We excluded intervention trials and studies on cohorts with additional comorbidities at baseline, studies with missing data on the transition from IH to T2DM, and studies where T2DM incidence was evaluated by documents or self-report only.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted study characteristics, and a second author checked the extracted data. We used a tailored version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing risk of bias. We pooled incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) using a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity. To meta-analyse incidence data, we used a method for pooling proportions. For hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) of IH versus normoglycaemia, reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), we obtained standard errors from these CIs and performed random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse-variance method. We used multivariable HRs and the model with the greatest number of covariates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 103 prospective cohort studies. The studies mainly defined IH by IFG<sub>5.6</sub> (FPG mmol/L 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IFG<sub>6.1</sub> (FPG 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L or 110 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IGT (plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L to 11.1 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g glucose load on the oral glucose tolerance test, combined IFG and IGT (IFG/IGT), and elevated HbA1c (HbA1c<sub>5.7</sub>: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% or 39 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol; HbA1c<sub>6.0</sub>: HbA1c 6.0% to 6.4% or 42 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 years. Ninety-three studies evaluated the overall prognosis of people with IH measured by cumulative T2DM incidence, and 52 studies evaluated glycaemic status as a prognostic factor for T2DM by comparing a cohort with IH to a cohort with normoglycaemia. Participants were of Australian, European or North American origin in 41 studies; Latin American in 7; Asian or Middle Eastern in 50; and Islanders or American Indians in 5. Six studies included children and/or adolescents.Cumulative incidence of T2DM associated with IFG<sub>5.6</sub>, IFG<sub>6.1</sub>, IGT and the combination of IFG/IGT increased with length of follow-up. Cumulative incidence was highest with IFG/IGT, followed by IGT, IFG<sub>6.1</sub> and IFG<sub>5.6</sub>. Limited data showed a higher T2DM incidence associated with HbA1c<sub>6.0</sub> compared to HbA1c<sub>5.7</sub>. We rated the evidence for overall prognosis as of moderate certainty because of imprecision (wide CIs in most studies). In the 47 studies reporting restitution of normoglycaemia, regression ranged from 33% to 59% within one to five years follow-up, and from 17% to 42% for 6 to 11 years of follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence).Studies evaluating the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia reported different effect measures (HRs, IRRs and ORs). Overall, the effect measures all indicated an elevated risk of T2DM at 1 to 24 years of follow-up. Taking into account the long-term follow-up of cohort studies, estimation of HRs for time-dependent events like T2DM incidence appeared most reliable. The pooled HR and the number of studies and participants for different IH definitions as compared to normoglycaemia were: IFG<sub>5.6</sub>: HR 4.32 (95% CI 2.61 to 7.12), 8 studies, 9017 participants; IFG<sub>6.1</sub>: HR 5.47 (95% CI 3.50 to 8.54), 9 studies, 2818 participants; IGT: HR 3.61 (95% CI 2.31 to 5.64), 5 studies, 4010 participants; IFG and IGT: HR 6.90 (95% CI 4.15 to 11.45), 5 studies, 1038 participants; HbA1c<sub>5.7</sub>: HR 5.55 (95% CI 2.77 to 11.12), 4 studies, 5223 participants; HbA1c<sub>6.0</sub>: HR 10.10 (95% CI 3.59 to 28.43), 6 studies, 4532 participants. In subgroup analyses, there was no clear pattern of differences between geographic regions. We downgraded the evidence for the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia to low-certainty evidence due to study limitations because many studies did not adequately adjust for confounders. Imprecision and inconsistency required further downgrading due to wide 95% CIs and wide 95% prediction intervals (sometimes ranging from negative to positive prognostic factor to outcome associations), respectively.This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall prognosis of people with IH worsened over time. T2DM cumulative incidence generally increased over the course of follow-up but varied with IH definition. Regression from IH to normoglycaemia decreased over time but was observed even after 11 years of follow-up. The risk of developing T2DM when comparing IH with normoglycaemia at baseline varied by IH definition. Taking into consideration the uncertainty of the available evidence, as well as the fluctuating stages of normoglycaemia, IH and T2DM, which may transition from one stage to another in both directions even after years of follow-up, practitioners should be careful about the potential implications of any active intervention for people 'diagnosed' with IH."

In combination with genotyping, such studies offer the prospect to 1) identify mechanisms involved with regulation of protein expression in plasma, and 2) determine whether the plasma proteins are likely to be causally implicated in disease. We report here the results of genome-wide association (GWA) studies of 83 proteins considered relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD), measured in 3,394 individuals with multiple CVD risk factors. We identified 79 genome-wide significant (p<5e-8) association signals, 55 of which replicated at P<0.0007 in separate validation studies (n = 2,639 individuals). Using automated text mining, manual curation, and network-based methods incorporating information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we propose plausible causal mechanisms for 25 trans-acting loci, including a potential post-translational regulation of stem cell factor by matrix metalloproteinase 9 and receptor-ligand pairs such as RANK-RANK ligand. Using public GWA study data, we further evaluate all 79 loci for their causal effect on coronary artery disease, and highlight several potentially causal associations. Overall, a majority of the plasma proteins studied showed evidence of regulation at the genetic level. Our results enable future studies of the causal architecture of human disease, which in turn should aid discovery of new drug targets."

OBJECTIVE: The goal of MADE is to provide a set of common evaluation tasks to assess the state of the art for natural language processing (NLP) systems applied to EHRs supporting drug safety surveillance and pharmacovigilance. We also provide benchmarks on the MADE dataset using the system submissions received in the MADE 2018 challenge.
METHODS: The MADE 1.0 challenge has released an expert-annotated cohort of medication and ADE information comprising 1089 fully de-identified longitudinal EHR notes from 21 randomly selected patients with cancer at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital. Using this cohort as a benchmark, the MADE 1.0 challenge designed three shared NLP tasks. The named entity recognition (NER) task identifies medications and their attributes (dosage, route, duration, and frequency), indications, ADEs, and severity. The relation identification (RI) task identifies relations between the named entities: medication-indication, medication-ADE, and attribute relations. The third shared task (NER-RI) evaluates NLP models that perform the NER and RI tasks jointly. In total, 11 teams from four countries participated in at least one of the three shared tasks, and 41 system submissions were received in total.
RESULTS: The best systems F<sub>1</sub> scores for NER, RI, and NER-RI were 0.82, 0.86, and 0.61, respectively. Ensemble classifiers using the team submissions improved the performance further, with an F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.85, 0.87, and 0.66 for the three tasks, respectively.
CONCLUSION: MADE results show that recent progress in NLP has led to remarkable improvements in NER and RI tasks for the clinical domain. However, some room for improvement remains, particularly in the NER-RI task."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: : This retrospective study is approved by the institutional review board, with waiver of informed consent. Natural language processing is used for filtering of adrenal incidentaloma cases in all thoracic and abdominal CT reports from 2010 till 2012. A total of 635 patients are identified. Stepwise logistic regression is used to construct the prediction model. The model predicts if a patient is at risk for malignancy or hormonal hyperfunction of the adrenal gland at the moment of initial presentation, thus generates a predicted probability for every individual patient. The prediction model is evaluated on its usefulness in clinical practice using decision curve analysis (DCA) based on different threshold probabilities. For patients whose predicted probability is lower than the predetermined threshold probability, further workup could be omitted.
RESULTS: : A prediction model is successfully developed, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78. Results of the DCA indicate that up to 11% of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma can be avoided from unnecessary workup, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 11%.
CONCLUSION: : A prediction model can accurately predict if an adrenal incidentaloma patient is at risk for malignancy or hormonal hyperfunction of the adrenal gland based on initial imaging features and patient demographics. However, with most adrenal incidentalomas labeled as nonfunctional adrenocortical adenomas requiring no further treatment, it is likely that more patients could be omitting from unnecessary diagnostics."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched 6 databases to identify relevant studies published through May 1, 2023. The study selection was conducted through a title screening, an abstract review, and a full-text review. Our process followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.
RESULTS: Of the 2446 publications identified from our searches, 39 studies were selected for the final review, which summarized: (1) definitions and context of empathy, (2) data sources and tested models, and (3) model performance. Definitions of empathy varied in their specificity to the context and setting of the study. The most common settings in which empathy was studied were reactions to news stories, health-related social media forums, and counseling sessions. We also observed an expected shift in methods used that coincided with the introduction of transformer-based models.
DISCUSSION: Aspects of the current approaches taken across various domains may be translatable to communication over a patient portal. However, the specific barriers to identifying empathic communication in this context are unclear. While modern NLP methods appear to be able to handle empathy-related tasks, challenges remain in precisely defining and measuring empathy in text.
CONCLUSION: Existing work that has attempted to measure empathy in text using NLP provides a useful basis for future studies of patient-physician asynchronous communication, but consideration for the conceptualization of empathy is needed."

DATA SOURCES:  We conducted a search on the PubMed, Cochrane, Bireme, and Theses databases until June 2022.
SELECTION OF STUDIES: Using the keywords intra-amniotic sludge or fluid sludge or echogenic particles, we found 263 articles, 132 of which were duplicates, and 70 were discarded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.
DATA COLLECTION:  The articles retrieved were analyzed by 2 reviewers; 61 were selected for full-text analysis, 18 were included for a qualitative analysis, and 14, for a quantitative analysis.
DATA SYNTHESIS:  Among the maternal outcomes analyzed, there was an increased risk of preterm labor (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.45-2.03), premature rupture of ovular membranes (95%CI: 1.99-3.79), and clinical (95%CI: 1.41-6.19) and histological chorioamnionitis (95%CI: 1.75-3.12). Regarding the fetal outcomes, there was a significant increase in the risk of morbidity (95%CI: 1.80-3.17), mortality (95%CI: 1.14-18.57), admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU; 95%CI: 1.17-1.95), and neonatal sepsis (95%CI: 2.29-7.55).
CONCLUSION:  The results of the present study indicate that the presence of amniotic sludge is a risk marker for preterm delivery. Despite the heterogeneity of the studies analyzed, even in patients with other risk factors for prematurity, such as short cervix and previous preterm delivery, the presence of amniotic sludge increases the risk of premature labor. Moreover, antibiotic therapy seems to be a treatment for amniotic sludge, and it may prolong pregnancy."

This article reviews three sources of evidence in a comprehensive body of research aligning with three main themes: (a) associations between musical rhythm and speech/language processing, (b) musical rhythm in children with developmental speech/language disorders and common comorbid attentional and motor disorders, and (c) individual differences in mechanisms underlying rhythm processing in infants and their relationship with later speech/language development. In light of converging evidence on associations between musical rhythm and speech/language processing, we propose the Atypical Rhythm Risk Hypothesis, which posits that individuals with atypical rhythm are at higher risk for developmental speech/language disorders. The hypothesis is framed within the larger epidemiological literature in which recent methodological advances allow for large-scale testing of shared underlying biology across clinically distinct disorders. A series of predictions for future work testing the Atypical Rhythm Risk Hypothesis are outlined. We suggest that if a significant body of evidence is found to support this hypothesis, we can envision new risk factor models that incorporate atypical rhythm to predict the risk of developing speech/language disorders.

This paper reports on a conceptual review of the literature on machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interrogate big data for identifying sex-specific health disparities. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO in October 2021 using synonyms and indexing terms for (a) ""women,"" ""men,"" or ""sex""; (b) ""big data,"" ""artificial intelligence,"" or ""NLP""; and (c) ""disparities"" or ""differences."" From 902 records, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Results demonstrate that the inclusion by sex is inconsistent and often unreported, although the inclusion of men in these studies is disproportionately less than women. Even though artificial intelligence and NLP techniques are widely applied in healthresearch, few studies use them to take advantage of unstructured text to investigate sex-related differences or disparities. Researchers are increasingly aware of sex-based data bias, but the process toward correction is slow. We reflect on best practices on using big data analytics to address sex-specific biases in understanding the etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases."
25795924,Machine learning approaches to analysing textual injury surveillance data: a systematic review,Vallmuur K.,Accid Anal Prev. 2015 Jun;79:41-9. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2015.03.018. Epub 2015 Mar 19.,Vallmuur K,Accid Anal Prev,2015,2015/03/22,,,10.1016/j.aap.2015.03.018,"OBJECTIVE: To synthesise recent research on the use of machine learning approaches to mining textual injury surveillance data.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases which were searched included PubMed, Cinahl, Medline, Google Scholar, and Proquest. The bibliography of all relevant articles was examined and associated articles were identified using a snowballing technique.
SELECTION CRITERIA: For inclusion, articles were required to meet the following criteria: (a) used a health-related database, (b) focused on injury-related cases, AND used machine learning approaches to analyse textual data.
METHODS: The papers identified through the search were screened resulting in 16 papers selected for review. Articles were reviewed to describe the databases and methodology used, the strength and limitations of different techniques, and quality assurance approaches used. Due to heterogeneity between studies meta-analysis was not performed.
RESULTS: Occupational injuries were the focus of half of the machine learning studies and the most common methods described were Bayesian probability or Bayesian network based methods to either predict injury categories or extract common injury scenarios. Models were evaluated through either comparison with gold standard data or content expert evaluation or statistical measures of quality. Machine learning was found to provide high precision and accuracy when predicting a small number of categories, was valuable for visualisation of injury patterns and prediction of future outcomes. However, difficulties related to generalizability, source data quality, complexity of models and integration of content and technical knowledge were discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of narrative text for injury surveillance has grown in popularity, complexity and quality over recent years. With advances in data mining techniques, increased capacity for analysis of large databases, and involvement of computer scientists in the injury prevention field, along with more comprehensive use and description of quality assurance methods in text mining approaches, it is likely that we will see a continued growth and advancement in knowledge of text mining in the injury field."

Epub 2023 Nov 1.,Sim JA,Artif Intell Med,2023,2023/12/02,PMC10693655,NIHMS1946177,10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102701,"OBJECTIVE: Natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used to process unstructured/free-text patient-reported outcome (PRO) data available in electronic health records (EHRs). This systematic review summarizes the literature reporting NLP/ML systems/toolkits for analyzing PROs in clinical narratives of EHRs and discusses the future directions for the application of this modality in clinical care.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies written in English between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2020. Seventy-nine studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included. We abstracted and summarized information related to the study purpose, patient population, type/source/amount of unstructured PRO data, linguistic features, and NLP systems/toolkits for processing unstructured PROs in EHRs.
RESULTS: Most of the studies used NLP/ML techniques to extract PROs from clinical narratives (n = 74) and mapped the extracted PROs into specific PRO domains for phenotyping or clustering purposes (n = 26). Some studies used NLP/ML to process PROs for predicting disease progression or onset of adverse events (n = 22) or developing/validating NLP/ML pipelines for analyzing unstructured PROs (n = 19). Studies used different linguistic features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, to process unstructured PROs. Among the 25 NLP systems/toolkits we identified, 15 used rule-based NLP, 6 used hybrid NLP, and 4 used non-neural ML algorithms embedded in NLP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the potential utility of different NLP/ML techniques in processing unstructured PROs available in EHRs for clinical care. Though using annotation rules for NLP/ML to analyze unstructured PROs is dominant, deploying novel neural ML-based methods is warranted."

Investigating mechanistic pathways can provide evidence of biological plausibility and improve causal inference. This project will examine three putative pathways (sex steroid hormones, insulin signaling, and inflammation) in a series of two-stage systematic reviews. Stage 1 used Text Mining for Mechanism Prioritisation (TeMMPo) to identify and prioritize relevant biological intermediates. Stage 2 will systematically review the findings from studies of (i) physical activity and intermediates and (ii) intermediates and breast cancer. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus will be searched using a combination of subject headings and free-text terms. Human intervention and prospective, observational studies will be eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis will be performed where possible. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool, or the ROBINS-I or ROBINS-E tool, depending on study type. Strength of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE system. In addition to synthesizing the mechanistic evidence that links physical activity with breast cancer risk, this project may also identify priority areas for future research and help inform the design and implementation of physical activity interventions.See related reviews by Swain et al., p. 16 and Drummond et al., p. 28."

Many of these difficulties are fundamentally information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing (NLP)-the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language-can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition, literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and remaining challenges."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search was performed in the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE-PubMed), SCOPUS, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science databases (finished on November 30, 2022). Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to PRISMA statement. Prospective cohort studies that evaluate the incidence of peri-implantitis in smokers and non-smokers were included. Two authors independently searched for eligible studies, screened titles, and abstracts, did the full-text analysis, extracted data, and performed the risk-of-bias assessment. The results were summarized through random-effects meta-analyses. The GRADE method was used to determine the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies with 702 patients and 1959 implants were included for analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant difference between smokers and non-smokers for the risk of peri-implantitis in the implant-based (p < .0001) and patient-based analysis (p = .003). A strong association between smoking and the risk for peri-implantitis was verified at the implant level (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.46-1.85) and the patient level (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.42-5.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence suggests that smoking is associated with peri-implantitis compared to non-smoking at the patient and implant levels."

However, there are many obstacles to the repurposing of clinical data. The development of decision support systems depends on the ability to recruit patients, extract and integrate the patients' data, mine and stratify these data, and integrate the decision support algorithm into patient care. This last step requires an adaptability of the electronic health records to integrate learning health system tools. In this literature review, we examine the research that provides solutions to unlock these barriers and accelerate translational research: structured electronic health records and free-text search engines to find patients, data warehouses and natural language processing to extract phenotypes, machine learning algorithms to classify patients, and similarity metrics to diagnose patients. Medical informatics is experiencing an impellent request to develop decision support systems, and this requires ethical considerations for clinicians and patients to ensure appropriate use of health data."

This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system's performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems. Finally, we summarize promising results and open challenges for text mining the COVID-19 literature."

At the same time, further and more dramatic changes have also occurred on the working environment, adding to the already existing dynamic nature of it. Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to a collection of methods for identifying, reading, extracting and untimely transforming large collections of language. In this work, we aim to give an overview of how NLP has successfully been applied thus far in Exposome research.
METHODS: We conduct a literature search on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for scientific articles published between 2011 and 2021. We use both quantitative and qualitative methods to screen papers and provide insights into the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We outline our approach for article selection and provide an overview of our findings. This is followed by a more detailed insight into selected articles.
RESULTS: Overall, 6420 articles were screened for the suitability of this review, where we review 37 articles in depth. Finally, we discuss future avenues of research and outline challenges in existing work.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (i) there has been an increase in articles published that focus on applying NLP to exposure and epidemiology research, (ii) most work uses existing NLP tools and (iii) traditional machine learning is the most popular approach."

Furthermore, not all hypothesized markers will be borne out in a study, suggesting that high-quality initial hypotheses are crucial. In this chapter, we describe a high-throughput pipeline to produce a ranked list of high-quality hypothesized biomarkers for diseases. We review an example use of this approach to generate a large number of candidate disease biomarker hypotheses derived from machine learning models, filter and rank them according to their potential novelty using text mining, and corroborate the most promising hypotheses with further statistical modeling. The example use of the pipeline uses a large electronic health record dataset and the PubMed corpus, to find several promising hypothesized laboratory tests with previously undocumented correlations to particular diseases."

DESIGN: Tutorial.
STUDY SAMPLE: None.
RESULTS: Strategies are reviewed to minimise confounding cognitive and language processing variables and accurately diagnose CAPD.
CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis is exceedingly important and can be quite challenging. Distinguishing between two or more conditions presenting with similar symptoms or attributes requires multidisciplinary, comprehensive assessment. To ensure appropriate interventions, the audiologist is a member of the multidisciplinary team responsible for determining whether there is an auditory component to other presenting deficits or whether one condition is responsible for the symptoms seen in another. Choice of tests should be guided both by the symptoms of the affected individual, as established in an in-depth interview and case history, the individual's age and primary language, and by the specific deficits reported to be associated with specific clinical presentations. Knowing which tests are available, their strengths and limitations, the processes assessed, task and response requirements, and the areas of the central auditory nervous system (CANS) to which each test is most sensitive provides the audiologist with critical information to assist in the differential diagnostic process."

New treatments and biomarkers of UC emerged in this decade. To identify the key information in a vast amount of literature can be challenging. In this study, we use text mining to explore UC publications to identify important information that may lead to new research directions.
METHOD: We used topic modeling to analyze the titles and abstracts of 29,883 articles of UC from Pubmed, Web of Science, and Embase in Mar 2020. We applied latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract 15 topics and conducted trend analysis. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analysis were performed to identify UC related pathways.
RESULTS: There was a growing trend regarding UC treatment especially immune checkpoint therapy but not the staging of UC. The risk factors of UC carried in different countries such as cigarette smoking in the United State and aristolochic acid in Taiwan and China. GMCSF, IL-5, Syndecan-1, ErbB receptor, integrin, c-Met, and TRAIL signaling pathways are the most relevant biological pathway associated with UC.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors of UC may be dependent on the countries and GMCSF, IL-5, Syndecan-1, ErbB receptor, integrin, c-Met, and TRAIL signaling pathways are the most relevant biological pathway associated with UC. These findings may provide further UC research directions."

The present study aims to uncover molecular associations between periodontitis and coronary heart disease using an unbiased strategy of automatic text mining traditionally applied to bibliometric studies. A total of 1590 articles on these diseases were retrieved from the Web of knowledge database and searched using the VOS viewer to create a network of keywords associated with both diseases. These data were supplemented with data from DisGeNET, which stores known associations to either periodontitis or coronary heart disease. Overall, the automated text mining approach presented here highlighted inflammatory molecules as common associations between periodontitis and coronary heart disease. Specifically, this study showed that molecules such as C-reactive protein, interleukins 6 and 1-β, myeloperoxidase, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 are simultaneously associated with periodontitis and coronary artery disease by both text mining and DisGeNET analyses. This association validates the multiplex assessment of salivary inflammatory markers as a tool to assess cardiovascular disease risk and could become an important tool to identify common molecular targets to monitor both diseases simultaneously. In addition, the text mining protocol and subsequent data processing and methods using bioinformatics tools could be useful to uncover links between other diseases."

The recent advances in text mining in infectious diseases hold the potential of providing timely access to explicit and implicit associations among information in the text. In the past few years, the availability of online text data in the form of unstructured or semi-structured text with rich content of information from this domain enables many studies to provide solutions in this area, e.g., disease-related knowledge discovery, disease surveillance, early detection system, etc. However, a recent review of text mining in the domain of mosquito-borne disease was not available to the best of our knowledge. In this review, we survey the recent works in the text mining techniques used in combating mosquito-borne diseases. We highlight the corpus sources, technologies, applications, and the challenges faced by the studies, followed by the possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. We present a bibliometric analysis of the 294 scientific articles that have been published in Scopus and PubMed in the domain of text mining in mosquito-borne diseases, from the year 2016 to 2021. The papers were further filtered and reviewed based on the techniques used to analyze the text related to mosquito-borne diseases. Based on the corpus of 158 selected articles, we found 27 of the articles were relevant and used text mining in mosquito-borne diseases. These articles covered the majority of Zika (38.70%), Dengue (32.26%), and Malaria (29.03%), with extremely low numbers or none of the other crucial mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile fever. Twitter was the dominant corpus resource to perform text mining in mosquito-borne diseases, followed by PubMed and LexisNexis databases. Sentiment analysis was the most popular technique of text mining to understand the discourse of the disease and followed by information extraction, which dependency relation and co-occurrence-based approach to extract relations and events. Surveillance was the main usage of most of the reviewed studies and followed by treatment, which focused on the drug-disease or symptom-disease association. The advance in text mining could improve the management of mosquito-borne diseases. However, the technique and application posed many limitations and challenges, including biases like user authentication and language, real-world implementation, etc. We discussed the future direction which can be useful to expand this area and domain. This review paper contributes mainly as a library for text mining in mosquito-borne diseases and could further explore the system for other neglected diseases."

There are two main factors in the frequent occurrence of drug safety problems; on the one hand, the clinical understanding of drug side effects is insufficient, leading to frequent adverse drug reactions, while on the other hand, due to the long-term period and complexity of clinical trials, side effects of approved drugs on the market cannot be reported in a timely manner. Therefore, many researchers have focused on developing methods to identify drug side effects. In this review, we summarize the methods of identifying drug side effects and common databases in this field. We classified methods of identifying side effects into four categories: biological experimental, machine learning, text mining and network methods. We point out the key points of each kind of method. In addition, we also explain the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we propose future research directions."

METHODS: We followed the scoping review methodologies developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute. After developing search strategies based on keywords (eg, social media, health research), comprehensive searches were conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. We limited the search strategies to documents written in English and published between January 1, 2005, and April 9, 2020. After removing duplicates, articles were screened at the title and abstract level and at the full text level by two independent reviewers. One reviewer extracted data, which were descriptively analyzed to map the available evidence.
RESULTS: After screening 1237 titles and abstracts and 407 full texts, 268 unique papers were included, dating from 2009 to 2020 with an average annual growth rate of 32.71% for the 2009-2019 period. Studies mainly came from the Americas (173/268, 64.6%, including 151 from the United States). Articles used machine learning or data mining techniques (60/268) to analyze the data, discussed opportunities and limitations of the use of social media for research (59/268), assessed the feasibility of recruitment strategies (45/268), or discussed ethical issues (16/268). Communicable (eg, influenza, 40/268) and then chronic (eg, cancer, 24/268) diseases were the two main areas of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: Since their early days, social media have been recognized as resources with high potential for health research purposes, yet the field is still suffering from strong heterogeneity in the methodologies used, which prevents the research from being compared and generalized. For the field to be fully recognized as a valid, complementary approach to more traditional health research study designs, there is now a need for more guidance by types of applications of social media for health research, both from a methodological and an ethical perspective.

32008076,Etiology and therapy of delayed facial paralysis after middle ear surgery,"Eckermann J, Meyer JE, Guenzel T.",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2020 Apr;277(4):965-974. doi: 10.1007/s00405-020-05825-y. Epub 2020 Feb 1.,Eckermann J,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,2020,2020/02/03,,,10.1007/s00405-020-05825-y,"PURPOSE: This review focuses on the etiology, incidence and therapy of delayed paralysis of the facial nerve (DFP) after different types of middle ear surgery.
METHODS: Retrospective review of studies published in English from 1970 until 2019 reporting DFP after tympanoplasty, tympanomastoid surgery, stapedotomy and stapedectomy. The search used the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library. Studies reporting from adult patients and DFP onset after 48 h after surgery were included. Studies dealing with iatrogenic or preexisting facial palsy and case reports were excluded. The initial literature search resulted in 52 studies. The relevance of the publications was verified using title, abstract and full-text analysis. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using median, simple sum and statistical significance.
RESULTS: Ten studies having 12,161 patients could be included in this review. The incidence of DFP after the middle ear surgeries varies between 0.2 and 1.9%. The surgical stress of the middle ear surgeries is the main trigger for the development of DFP and leads to a virus reactivation and/or neuronal edema. Patients with a dehiscence of the facial canal have a significantly higher probability for a DFP. The recommended therapy of DFP based on the data of the therapy of Bell's palsy, consists of the administration of a steroid. For patients having a case history of previous viral infections, an antiviral prophylaxis is recommended.
CONCLUSION: Overall, DFP has a very good prognosis, with mostly complete healing with appropriate therapy. Viral reactivation is the most favored genesis of DFP. Immunization or antiviral prophylaxis is recommended to those patients being at risk for a viral reactivation."

Assessing antiepileptic drug (AED) efficacy and other epilepsy variables pertinent to healthcare delivery remain a critical barrier to improving patient care. In this systematic review, we examined automatic electronic health record (EHR) extraction methodologies pertinent to epilepsy. We also reviewed more generalizable NLP pipelines to extract other critical patient variables. Our review found varying reports of performance measures. Whereas automated data extraction pipelines are a crucial advancement, this review calls attention to standardizing NLP methodology and accuracy reporting for greater generalizability. Moreover, the use of crowdsourcing competitions to spur innovative NLP pipelines would further advance this field."

METHODS: An enriched cohort of 7853 eligible patients was created from electronic health records of two large hospitals using automated searches (⩾1 ICD codes combined with simple text searches). Key disease concepts from free-text data were extracted using NLP and combined with ICD codes to develop algorithms. We created both supervised regression-based algorithms-on a training set of 127 axSpA cases and 423 non-cases-and unsupervised algorithms to identify patients with high probability of having axSpA from the enriched cohort. Their performance was compared against classifications using ICD codes only.
RESULTS: NLP extracted four disease concepts of high predictive value: ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, HLA-B27 and spondylitis. The unsupervised algorithm, incorporating both the NLP concept and ICD code for AS, identified the greatest number of patients. By setting the probability threshold to attain 80% positive predictive value, it identified 1509 axSpA patients (mean age 53 years, 71% male). Sensitivity was 0.78, specificity 0.94 and area under the curve 0.93. The two supervised algorithms performed similarly but identified fewer patients. All three outperformed traditional approaches using ICD codes alone (area under the curve 0.80-0.87).
CONCLUSION: Algorithms incorporating free-text data can accurately identify axSpA patients in electronic health records. Large cohorts identified using these novel methods offer exciting opportunities for future clinical research."

METHODS: An observational, retrospective analysis was conducted on EHR data from all patients with SpA (including psoriatic arthritis (PsA)) at Hospital Universitario La Paz, between 2020 and 2022. Data were collected using Savana Manager, an NLP-based system, enabling the extraction of information from unstructured, free-text EHRs. Variables analysed included demographic data, SpA subtypes, comorbidities and treatments. The performance of the technology in detecting SpA clinical entities was evaluated through precision, recall and F-1 score metrics.
RESULTS: From a hospital population of 639 474 patients, 4337 (0.7%) patients had a diagnosis of SpA or their subtypes in their EHR. The population predominantly comprised men (55.3%) with a mean age of 50.9 years. Peripheral SpA (including PsA) was reported in 31.6%, axial SpA in 20.9%, both axial and peripheral SpA in 3.7%, while 43.7% of patients did not have the SpA subtype reported. Common comorbidities included hypertension (25.0%), dyslipidaemia (22.2%) and diabetes mellitus (15.5%). The use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) was documented, with methotrexate (25.3% of patients) being the most used csDMARDs and adalimumab (10.6% of patients) the most used bDMARD. The NLP technology demonstrated high precision and recall, with all the assessed F-1 score values over 0.80, indicating reliable data extraction.
CONCLUSION: The application of NLP technology facilitated the characterisation of the SpA patient profile, including demographics, clinical features, comorbidities and treatments. This study supports the utility of NLP in enhancing the understanding of SpA and suggests its potential for improving patient management by extracting meaningful information from unstructured EHR data."

We performed natural language processing (NLP) of 743 838 operative notes recorded for 315 246 surgeries to ascertain two variables needed to study the comparative effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in cataract surgery. The first key variable was an exposure variable, intracameral antibiotic injection. The second was an intraoperative complication, posterior capsular rupture (PCR), which functioned as a potential confounder. To help other researchers use NLP in their settings, we describe our NLP protocol and lessons learned.
METHODS: For each of the two variables, we used SAS Text Miner and other SAS text-processing modules with a training set of 10 000 (1.3%) operative notes to develop a lexicon. The lexica identified misspellings, abbreviations, and negations, and linked words into concepts (e.g. ""antibiotic"" linked with ""injection""). We confirmed the NLP tools by iteratively obtaining random samples of 2000 (0.3%) notes, with replacement.
RESULTS: The NLP tools identified approximately 60 000 intracameral antibiotic injections and 3500 cases of PCR. The positive and negative predictive values for intracameral antibiotic injection exceeded 99%. For the intraoperative complication, they exceeded 94%.
CONCLUSION: NLP was a valid and feasible method for obtaining critical variables needed for a research study of surgical safety. These NLP tools were intended for use in the study sample. Use with external datasets or future datasets in our own setting would require further testing. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The aim of the present study is to perform a systematic literature review on male and female sexual dysfunctions related to traumatic lesions of the pelvic ring.
METHODS: Scopus, Cochrane Library MEDLINE via PubMed, and Embase were searched using the keywords: ""Pelvic fracture,"" ""Pelvic Ring Fracture,"" ""Pelvic Ring Trauma,"" ""Pelvic Ring injury,"" ""Sexual dysfunction,"" ""Erectile dysfunction,"" ""dyspareunia,"" and their MeSH terms in any possible combination. The following questions were formulated according to the PICO (population (P), intervention (I), comparison (C), and outcome (O)) scheme: Do patients suffering from pelvic fracture (P) report worse clinical outcomes (C), in terms of sexual function (O), when urological injury occurs (I)? Is the sexual function (O) influenced by the type of fracture (I)?
RESULTS: After screening 268 articles by title and abstract, 77 were considered eligible for the full-text analysis. Finally 17 studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the review. Overall, 1364 patients (902 males and 462 females, M/F ratio: 1.9) suffering from pelvic fractures were collected.
DISCUSSION: Pelvic fractures represent challenging entities, often concomitant with systemic injuries and subsequent morbidity. Anatomical consideration, etiology, correlation between sexual dysfunction and genitourinary lesions, or pelvic fracture type were investigated.
CONCLUSION: There are evidences in the literature that the gravity and frequency of SD are related with the pelvic ring fracture type. In fact, patients with APC, VS (according Young-Burgess), or C (according Tile) fracture pattern reported higher incidence and gravity of SD. Only a week association could be found between GUI and incidence and gravity of SD, and relationship between surgical treatment and SD. Electrophysiological tests should be routinely used in patient suffering from SD after pelvic ring injuries."

RECENT FINDINGS: Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers.
SUMMARY: COVID-19 is significantly impacting the way we are delivering healthcare. Given the already successful implementation of artificial intelligence applications and telemedicine in ophthalmology, we expect that these systems will be embraced more as tools for research, education, and patient care."

Online ahead of print.,Tanoli Z,Expert Opin Drug Discov,2024,2024/11/21,,,10.1080/17460441.2024.2430955,"INTRODUCTION: Mapping the interactions between pharmaceutical compounds and their molecular targets is a fundamental aspect of drug discovery and repurposing. Drug-target interactions are important for elucidating mechanisms of action and optimizing drug efficacy and safety profiles. Several computational methods have been developed to systematically predict drug-target interactions. However, computational and experimental validation of the drug-target predictions greatly vary across the studies.
AREAS COVERED: Through a PubMed query, a corpus comprising 3,286 articles on drug-target interaction prediction published within the past decade was covered. Natural language processing was used for automated abstract classification to study the evolution of computational methods, validation strategies and performance assessment metrics in the 3,286 articles. Additionally, a manual analysis of 259 studies that performed experimental validation of computational predictions revealed prevalent experimental protocols.
EXPERT OPINION: Starting from 2014, there has been a noticeable increase in articles focusing on drug-target interaction prediction. Docking and regression stands out as the most commonly used techniques among computational methods, and cross-validation is frequently employed as the computational validation strategy. Testing the predictions using multiple, orthogonal validation strategies is recommended and should be reported for the specific target prediction applications. Experimental validation remains relatively rare and should be performed more routinely to evaluate biological relevance of predictions."

METHODS: We searched 6 databases for research articles pertinent to Ebola virus disease and social media. We extracted the data using a standardized form. We evaluated the quality of the included articles.
RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in the main analysis: 7 from Twitter with 1 also including Weibo, 1 from Facebook, 3 from YouTube, and 1 from Instagram and Flickr. All the studies were cross-sectional. Eleven of the 12 articles studied ≥ 1of these 3 elements of social media and their relationships: themes or topics of social media contents, meta-data of social media posts (such as frequency of original posts and reposts, and impressions) and characteristics of the social media accounts that made these posts (such as whether they are individuals or institutions). One article studied how news videos influenced Twitter traffic. Twitter content analysis methods included text mining (n = 3) and manual coding (n = 1). Two studies involved mathematical modeling. All 3 YouTube studies and the Instagram/Flickr study used manual coding of videos and images, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Published Ebola virus disease-related social media research focused on Twitter and YouTube. The utility of social media research to public health practitioners is warranted."

DATA SOURCES: We conducted a scoping review. PubMed, ProQuest, and Embase Scopus databases were searched with an end date of September 18, 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: DistillerSR was used for data management. Inclusion criteria were an asthma focus, human participants, ML techniques, and written in English. Exclusion criteria were abstract only, simulation-based, not human based, or were reviews or commentaries. Descriptive statistics were presented.
RESULTS: A total of 6,317 potential articles were found. After removing duplicates, and reviewing the titles and abstracts, 102 articles were included for the full text analysis. Asthma episode prediction (24.5%), asthma phenotype classification (16.7%), and genetic profiling of asthma (12.7%) were the top three study topics. Cohort (52.9%), cross-sectional (20.6%), and case-control studies (11.8%) were the study designs most frequently used. Regarding the ML techniques, 34.3% of the studies used more than one technique. Neural networks, clustering, and random forests were the most common ML techniques used where they were used in 20.6%, 18.6%, and 17.6% of studies, respectively. Very few studies considered location of residence (i.e. urban or rural status).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ML in asthma studies has been increasing with most of this focused on the three major topics (>50%). Future research using ML could focus on gaps such as a broader range of study topics and focus on its use in additional populations (e.g. location of residence).

Diet may influence the onset and progression of MS. A variety of literature reviews have been conducted in the field of diet and MS. However, conventional reviews mostly focus on specific topics rather than delivering a holistic view of the literature landscape. Using a data-driven approach, we aimed to provide an overview of the literature on diet and MS, revealing gaps in knowledge. We conducted citation network analysis to identify clusters of all available publications about diet and MS over the past 50 years. We also conducted topic analysis of each cluster and illustrated them in word clouds. Four main clusters were identified from 1626 publications: MS risk and symptom management; mouse models of MS; gluten sensitivity; and dysphagia. Citation network analysis revealed that in this emerging field, articles published after 1991 were more likely to be highly cited. Relatively few studies focused on MS disease progression compared to risk factors, and limited evidence was available for many foods and nutrients in relation to MS. Future studies could focus on filling these identified knowledge gaps."

Epub 2017 Jan 30.,Bortolin M,Prehosp Disaster Med,2017,2017/01/31,,,10.1017/S1049023X16001515,"UNLABELLED: Introduction Earthquake-related trauma results in crush injuries and bony- and soft-tissue trauma. There are no systematic reviews analyzing the typical injury patterns and treatments in ""Mega-Mass-Casualty"" earthquakes. The characterization of an injury pattern specific to disaster type, be it natural or manmade, is imperative to build an effective disaster preparedness and response system.
METHODS: The systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify all publications relating to earthquakes and the orthopedic treatment in adult patients. The following databases were searched: PubMed (Medline; US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, Maryland USA), Ovid (Ovid Technologies; New York, New York USA), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters; New York, New York USA), and The Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration; Oxford, United Kingdom).
RESULTS: The searches identified 4,704 articles: 4,445 after duplicates were removed. The papers were screened for title and abstract and 65 out of those were selected for full-text analysis. The quality of data does not permit a standard-of-care (SOC) to be defined. Scarcity and poor quality of the data collected also may suggest a low level of accountability of the activity of the international hospital teams. Qualitatively, it is possible to define that there are more open fractures during daytime hours than at night. Excluding data about open and closed fractures, for all types of injuries, the results underline that the higher the impact of the earthquake, as measured by Richter Magnitude Scale (RMS), the higher is the number of injuries. Discussion Regarding orthopedic injuries during earthquakes, special attention must be paid to the management of the lower limbs most frequently injured. Spinal cord involvement following spine fractures is an important issue: this underlines how a neurosurgeon on a disaster team could be an important asset during the response. Conservative treatment for fractures, when possible, should be encouraged in a disaster setting. Regarding amputation, it is important to underline how the response and the quality of health care delivered is different from one team to another. This study shows how important it is to improve, and to require, the accountability of international disaster teams in terms of type and quality of health care delivered, and to standardize the data collection.

Those critical of social media research often cite that it may be unrepresentative of the population; however, the suitability of social media data in digital epidemiology is more nuanced. Identifying the demographics of social media users can help establish representativeness.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the different approaches or combination of approaches to extract race or ethnicity from social media and report on the challenges of using these methods.
METHODS: We present a scoping review to identify methods used to extract the race or ethnicity of Twitter users from Twitter data sets. We searched 17 electronic databases from the date of inception to May 15, 2021, and carried out reference checking and hand searching to identify relevant studies. Sifting of each record was performed independently by at least two researchers, with any disagreement discussed. Studies were required to extract the race or ethnicity of Twitter users using either manual or computational methods or a combination of both.
RESULTS: Of the 1249 records sifted, we identified 67 (5.36%) that met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (51/67, 76%) have focused on US-based users and English language tweets (52/67, 78%). A range of data was used, including Twitter profile metadata, such as names, pictures, information from bios (including self-declarations), or location or content of the tweets. A range of methodologies was used, including manual inference, linkage to census data, commercial software, language or dialect recognition, or machine learning or natural language processing. However, not all studies have evaluated these methods. Those that evaluated these methods found accuracy to vary from 45% to 93% with significantly lower accuracy in identifying categories of people of color. The inference of race or ethnicity raises important ethical questions, which can be exacerbated by the data and methods used. The comparative accuracies of the different methods are also largely unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard accepted approach or current guidelines for extracting or inferring the race or ethnicity of Twitter users. Social media researchers must carefully interpret race or ethnicity and not overpromise what can be achieved, as even manual screening is a subjective, imperfect method. Future research should establish the accuracy of methods to inform evidence-based best practice guidelines for social media researchers and be guided by concerns of equity and social justice."

Ninety-day mortality related to ACLF is high and patients who do leave the hospital are frequently readmitted. Artificial intelligence (AI), which encompasses various classical and modern machine learning techniques, natural language processing, and other methods of predictive, prognostic, probabilistic, and simulation modeling, has emerged as an effective tool in various areas of healthcare. These methods are now being leveraged to potentially minimize physician and provider cognitive load and impact both short-term and long-term patient outcomes. However, the enthusiasm is tempered by ethical considerations and a current lack of proven benefits. In addition to prognostic applications, AI models can likely help improve the understanding of various mechanisms of morbidity and mortality in ACLF. Their overall impact on patient-centered outcomes and countless other aspects of patient care remains unclear. In this review, we discuss various AI approaches being utilized in healthcare and discuss the recent and expected future impact of AI on patients with ACLF through prognostic modeling and AI-based approaches."

Better language outcome measures are needed. Using language transcripts, we generated Automated Language Measures (ALMs) and tested their validity. 169 participants (96 ASD, 28 TD, 45 ADHD) ages 7 to 17 were evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Transcripts of one task were analyzed to generate seven ALMs: mean length of utterance in morphemes, number of different word roots (NDWR), um proportion, content maze proportion, unintelligible proportion, c-units per minute, and repetition proportion. With the exception of repetition proportion (p [Formula: see text]), nonparametric ANOVAs showed significant group differences (p[Formula: see text]). The TD and ADHD groups did not differ from each other in post-hoc analyses. With the exception of NDWR, the ASD group showed significantly (p[Formula: see text]) lower scores than both comparison groups. The ALMs were correlated with standardized clinical and language evaluations of ASD. In age- and IQ-adjusted logistic regression analyses, four ALMs significantly predicted ASD status with satisfactory accuracy (67.9-75.5%). When ALMs were combined together, accuracy improved to 82.4%. These ALMs offer a promising approach for generating novel outcome measures."

METHODS: This review presents the complications and the accompanying risk factors that were described in the selected full-text articles. The relevant full-text articles were found in Pubmed, ISI Web of Science and the CINAHL database.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 238 abstracts, 50 of which were finally selected for full-text analysis. The different types of endoscopic procedures each have specific complications, but bleeding and perforation occur in all procedures. It was found that bleeding, perforation, cardiovascular and respiratory complications were common complications.Furthermore, morbidity and mortality have been associated with risk factors such as older age, high ASA class and sedation.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopy is not without risk, although the prevalence of complications is low. Most complications seenin this analysis, are linked to known risk factors. Some complications might be preventable or avoidable, given a more systematic and comprehensive approach pre-, per- and postprocedural. The creation and implementation of an endoscopic safety checklist could be an -important supportive tool in lowering complications."

Their rapid identification is important for the cost-effective use of these programs. Traditional identification techniques perform poorly especially in pandemics. A descriptive observational study was carried out using 105,008 prior authorizations paid by a private health care provider with the application of an unsupervised natural language processing method by topic modeling to identify patients suspected of being infected by COVID-19. A total of 6 models were generated: 3 using the BERTopic algorithm and 3 Word2Vec models. The BERTopic model automatically creates disease groups. In the Word2Vec model, manual analysis of the first 100 cases of each topic was necessary to define the topics related to COVID-19. The BERTopic model with more than 1,000 authorizations per topic without word treatment selected more severe patients - average cost per prior authorizations paid of BRL 10,206 and total expenditure of BRL 20.3 million (5.4%) in 1,987 prior authorizations (1.9%). It had 70% accuracy compared to human analysis and 20% of cases with potential interest, all subject to analysis for inclusion in a health promotion program. It had an important loss of cases when compared to the traditional research model with structured language and identified other groups of diseases - orthopedic, mental and cancer. The BERTopic model served as an exploratory method to be used in case labeling and subsequent application in supervised models. The automatic identification of other diseases raises ethical questions about the treatment of health information by machine learning."

The objectives of this study are to (1) map and describe trans research in the social sciences, sciences, humanities, health, education, and business, (2) identify evidence gaps and opportunities for more responsible research with trans people, (3) assess the use of text mining for study identification, and (4) increase access to trans research for key stakeholders through the creation of a web-based evidence map.
METHODS: Study design was informed by community consultations and pilot searches. Eligibility criteria were established to include all original research of any design, including trans people or their health information, and published in English in peer-reviewed journals. A complex electronic search strategy based on relevant concepts in 15 databases was developed to obtain a broad range of results linked to transgender, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit individuals and communities. Searches conducted in early 2015 resulted in 25,242 references after removal of duplicates. Based on the number of references, resources, and an objective to capture upwards of 90% of the existing literature, this study is a good candidate for text mining using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to improve efficiency of the screening process. The following information will be collected for evidence mapping: study topic, study design, methods and data sources, recruitment strategies, sample size, sample demographics, researcher name and affiliation, country where research was conducted, funding source, and year of publication.
DISCUSSION: The proposed research incorporates an extensive search strategy, text mining, and evidence map; it therefore has the potential to build on knowledge in several fields. Review results will increase awareness of existing trans research, identify evidence gaps, and inform strategic research prioritization. Publishing the map online will improve access to research for key stakeholders including community members, policy makers, and healthcare providers. This study will also contribute to knowledge in the area of text mining for study identification by providing an example of how semi-automation performs for screening on title and abstract and on full text."

However, novel, scalable approaches to estimate disease progression using real-world data are needed to advance cancer outcomes research. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize examples from the existing literature on approaches to estimate real-world disease progression and their relative strengths and limitations, using lung cancer as a case study.
METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted in PubMed to identify articles that used approaches to estimate real-world disease progression in lung cancer patients. Data abstracted included data source, approach used to estimate real-world progression, and comparison to a selected gold standard (if applicable).
RESULTS: A total of 40 articles were identified from 2008 to 2022. Five approaches to estimate real-world disease progression were identified including manual abstraction of medical records, natural language processing of clinical notes and/or radiology reports, treatment-based algorithms, changes in tumor volume, and delta radiomics-based approaches. The accuracy of these progression approaches were assessed using different methods, including correlations between real-world endpoints and overall survival for manual abstraction (Spearman rank ρ = 0.61-0.84) and area under the curve for natural language processing approaches (area under the curve = 0.86-0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world disease progression has been measured in several observational studies of lung cancer. However, comparing the accuracy of methods across studies is challenging, in part, because of the lack of a gold standard and the different methods used to evaluate accuracy. Concerted efforts are needed to define a gold standard and quality metrics for real-world data."

In this review, we identify four overarching challenges in using EHR-based data for epidemiological analysis, with a particular emphasis on threats to validity. These challenges include representativeness of the EHR to a target population, the availability and interpretability of clinical and non-clinical data, and missing data at both the variable and observation levels. Each challenge reveals layers of assumptions that the epidemiologist is required to make, from the point of patient entry into the healthcare system, to the provider documenting the results of the clinical exam and follow-up of the patient longitudinally; all with the potential to bias the results of analysis of these data. Understanding the extent of as well as remediating potential biases requires a variety of methodological approaches, from traditional sensitivity analyses and validation studies, to newer techniques such as natural language processing. Beyond methods to address these challenges, it will remain crucial for epidemiologists to engage with clinicians and informaticians at their institutions to ensure data quality and accessibility by forming multidisciplinary teams around specific research projects."

In ischemic stroke (IS), subtype classification is critical for management and outcome prediction. This study sought to use natural language processing of electronic health records (EHR) combined with machine learning methods to automate IS subtyping.
METHODS: Among IS patients from an observational registry with TOAST subtyping adjudicated by board-certified vascular neurologists, we analyzed unstructured text-based EHR data including neurology progress notes and neuroradiology reports using natural language processing. We performed several feature selection methods to reduce the high dimensionality of the features and 5-fold cross validation to test generalizability of our methods and minimize overfitting. We used several machine learning methods and calculated the kappa values for agreement between each machine learning approach to manual adjudication. We then performed a blinded testing of the best algorithm against a held-out subset of 50 cases.
RESULTS: Compared to manual classification, the best machine-based classification achieved a kappa of .25 using radiology reports alone, .57 using progress notes alone, and .57 using combined data. Kappa values varied by subtype being highest for cardioembolic (.64) and lowest for cryptogenic cases (.47). In the held-out test subset, machine-based classification agreed with rater classification in 40 of 50 cases (kappa .72).
CONCLUSIONS: Automated machine learning approaches using textual data from the EHR shows agreement with manual TOAST classification. The automated pipeline, if externally validated, could enable large-scale stroke epidemiology research."

However, a comprehensive assessment of utilizing natural language processing (NLP) coupled with machine learning (ML) methods to analyze unstructured PROs and their clinical implementation for individuals affected by cancer remains lacking.
AREAS COVERED: This study aimed to systematically review published studies that used NLP techniques to extract and analyze PROs in clinical narratives from EHRs for cancer populations. We examined the types of NLP (with and without ML) techniques and platforms for data processing, analysis, and clinical applications.
EXPERT OPINION: Utilizing NLP methods offers a valuable approach for processing and analyzing unstructured PROs among cancer patients and survivors. These techniques encompass a broad range of applications, such as extracting or recognizing PROs, categorizing, characterizing, or grouping PROs, predicting or stratifying risk for unfavorable clinical results, and evaluating connections between PROs and adverse clinical outcomes. The employment of NLP techniques is advantageous in converting substantial volumes of unstructured PRO data within EHRs into practical clinical utilities for individuals with cancer."

However, the rationale for studying patients' trajectories, and how this trajectory concept is defined remains a public health challenge. Our research was focused on patients' trajectories based on disease management and care, while also considering medico-economic aspects of the associated management. We illustrated this concept with an example: a myocardial infarction (MI) occurring in a patient's hospital trajectory of care. The patient follow-up was traced via the prospective payment system. We applied a semi-automatic text mining process to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. This review investigated how the concept of trajectory is defined, studied and what it achieves.
METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to identify reports that had been published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2015. Fourteen search questions were formulated to guide our review. A semi-automatic text mining process based on a semantic approach was performed to conduct a comprehensive review of patient healthcare trajectory studies. Text mining techniques were used to explore the corpus in a semantic perspective in order to answer non-a priori questions. Complementary review methods on a selected subset were used to answer a priori questions.
RESULTS: Among the 33,514 publications initially selected for analysis, only 70 relevant articles were semi-automatically extracted and thoroughly analysed. Oncology is particularly prevalent due to its already well-established processes of care. For the trajectory thema, 80% of articles were distributed in 11 clusters. These clusters contain distinct semantic information, for example health outcomes (29%), care process (26%) and administrative and financial aspects (16%).
CONCLUSION: This literature review highlights the recent interest in the trajectory concept. The approach is also gradually being used to monitor trajectories of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes, organ failure or coronary artery and MI trajectory of care, to improve care and reduce costs. Patient trajectory is undoubtedly an essential approach to be further explored in order to improve healthcare monitoring."

Clinical informatics can provide tools to better understand and address these disparities by enabling high-throughput analysis of multiple types of data. Here, we review recent efforts in clinical informatics to study and measure disparities in cancer.
METHODS: We carried out a narrative review of clinical informatics studies related to cancer disparities and bias published from 2018-2021, with a focus on domains such as real-world data (RWD) analysis, natural language processing (NLP), radiomics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics.
RESULTS: Clinical informatics studies that investigated cancer disparities across race, ethnicity, gender, and age were identified. Most cancer disparities work within clinical informatics used RWD analysis, NLP, radiomics, and genomics. Emerging applications of clinical informatics to understand cancer disparities, including proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, were less well represented in the literature but are promising future research avenues. Algorithmic bias was identified as an important consideration when developing and implementing cancer clinical informatics techniques, and efforts to address this bias were reviewed.
CONCLUSIONS: In recent years, clinical informatics has been used to probe a range of data sources to understand cancer disparities across different populations. As informatics tools become integrated into clinical decision-making, attention will need to be paid to ensure that algorithmic bias does not amplify existing disparities. In our increasingly interconnected medical systems, clinical informatics is poised to untap the full potential of multi-platform health data to address cancer disparities."

Epub 2022 Jul 12.,Bataille P,Br J Dermatol,2022,2022/06/30,,,10.1111/bjd.21716,"BACKGROUND: Paradoxical reactions (PRs) are defined as the occurrence during biologic therapy of a pathological condition that usually responds to these drugs.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence of PRs and identify risk factors.
METHODS: Multicentre study of the database for the Greater Paris University Hospitals, including biologic-naive patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor-α, anti-interleukin-12/23, anti-interleukin-17 or anti-α4β7-integrin agents for psoriasis, inflammatory rheumatism or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We used natural language processing algorithms to extract data. A cohort and a case-control study nested in the cohort with controls selected by incidence density sampling was used to identify risk factors.
RESULTS: Most of the 9303 included patients (median age 43·0, 53·8% women) presented an IBD (3773, 40·6%) or a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (3708, 39·9%), and 8489 (91·3%) received anti-TNF-α agents. A total of 297 (3·2%) had a PR. The global incidence rate was 7·6 per 1000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 6·8-8·5]. The likelihood of PR was associated with IBD [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1·9, 95% CI 1·1-3·2, P = 0·021] and a combination of at least two inflammatory diseases (aOR 6·1, 95% CI 3·6-10·6, P < 0·001) and was reduced with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and corticosteroids (aOR 0·6, 95% CI 0·4-0·8, P = 0·002; and OR 0·4, 95% CI 0·2-0·6, P = 0·002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of PRs was associated with IBD or a combination of a least two inflammatory diseases. More studies are needed to assess the benefit of systematically adding csDMARDs for such high-risk patients. What is already known about this topic? Most published studies about paradoxical reactions concern paradoxical psoriasis in patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor-α agents. Few data are available for other paradoxical reactions and the most recent biologics. What does this study add? Risk of paradoxical reactions was increased with inflammatory bowel disease and a combination of at least two inflammatory diseases. Risk of paradoxical reactions was reduced with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or corticosteroid therapy, which could be added for high-risk patients."

Epub 2021 Feb 4.,McLenon M,J Vasc Surg,2021,2021/02/06,,,10.1016/j.jvs.2020.12.090,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of the natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have been limited by small cohort sizes or heterogeneous analyses of pooled data. By quickly and efficiently extracting imaging data from the health records, natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to substantially improve how we study and care for patients with AAAs. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of an NLP tool to accurately identify the presence or absence of AAAs and detect the maximal abdominal aortic diameter in a large dataset of imaging study reports.
METHODS: Relevant imaging study reports (n = 230,660) from 2003 to 2017 were obtained for 32,778 patients followed up in a prospective aneurysm surveillance registry within a large, diverse, integrated healthcare system. A commercially available NLP algorithm was used to assess the presence of AAAs, confirm the absence of AAAs, and extract the maximal diameter of the abdominal aorta, if stated. A blinded expert manual review of 18,000 randomly selected imaging reports was used as the reference standard. The positive predictive value (PPV or precision), sensitivity (recall), and the kappa statistics were calculated.
RESULTS: Of the randomly selected 18,000 studies that underwent expert manual review, 48.7% were positive for AAAs. In confirming the presence of an AAA, the interrater reliability of the NLP compared with the expert review showed a kappa value of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.85), with a PPV of 95% and sensitivity of 88.5%. The NLP algorithm showed similar results for confirming the absence of an AAA, with a kappa of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.799-0.80), PPV of 77.7%, and sensitivity of 91.9%. The kappa, PPV, and sensitivity of the NLP for correctly identifying the maximal aortic diameter was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87-0.89), 88.8%, and 88.2% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of NLP software can accurately analyze large volumes of radiology report data to detect AAA disease and assemble a contemporary aortic diameter-based cohort of patients for longitudinal analysis to guide surveillance, medical management, and operative decision making. It can also potentially be used to identify from the electronic medical records pre- and postoperative AAA patients ""lost to follow-up,"" leverage human resources engaged in the ongoing surveillance of patients with AAAs, and facilitate the construction and implementation of AAA screening programs."

We herein aim to critically examine the current state of ML in predicting surgical outcomes, evaluate the quality of currently available research, and propose areas of improvement for future uses of ML in surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were reviewed under search syntax ""machine learning"" and ""surgery"" for papers published between 2015 and 2020.
RESULTS: Of the initial 2677 studies, 45 papers met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen different subspecialties were represented with neurosurgery being most common. The most frequently used ML algorithms were random forest (n = 19), artificial neural network (n = 17), and logistic regression (n = 17). Common outcomes included postoperative mortality, complications, patient reported quality of life and pain improvement. All studies which compared ML algorithms to conventional studies which used area under the curve (AUC) to measure accuracy found improved outcome prediction with ML models.
CONCLUSIONS: While still in its early stages, ML models offer surgeons an opportunity to capitalize on the myriad of clinical data available and improve individualized patient care. Limitations included heterogeneous outcome and imperfect quality of some of the papers. We therefore urge future research to agree upon methods of outcome reporting and require basic quality standards."

Natural Language Processing algorithms may be useful to identify diagnoses in electronic healthcare records to improve the recording and coding of these ageing syndromes, but the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of such algorithms are unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review according to a predefined protocol and in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were run from the inception of each database to the end of September 2023 in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, ACM digital library, IEEE Xplore and Scopus. Eligible studies were identified via independent review of search results by two coauthors and data extracted from each study to identify the computational method, source of text, testing strategy and performance metrics. Data were synthesised narratively by ageing syndrome and computational method in line with the Studies Without Meta-analysis guidelines.
RESULTS: From 1030 titles screened, 22 studies were eligible for inclusion. One study focussed on identifying sarcopenia, one frailty, twelve falls, five delirium, five dementia and four incontinence. Sensitivity (57.1%-100%) of algorithms compared with a reference standard was reported in 20 studies, and specificity (84.0%-100%) was reported in only 12 studies. Study design quality was variable with results relevant to diagnostic accuracy not always reported, and few studies undertaking external validation of algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that Natural Language Processing algorithms can identify ageing syndromes in electronic health records. However, algorithms require testing in rigorously designed diagnostic accuracy studies with appropriate metrics reported."
36933631,Trends and opportunities in computable clinical phenotyping: A scoping review,"He T, Belouali A, Patricoski J, Lehmann H, Ball R, Anagnostou V, Kreimeyer K, Botsis T.",J Biomed Inform. 2023 Apr;140:104335. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104335. Epub 2023 Mar 16.,He T,J Biomed Inform,2023,2023/03/18,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104335,"Identifying patient cohorts meeting the criteria of specific phenotypes is essential in biomedicine and particularly timely in precision medicine. Many research groups deliver pipelines that automatically retrieve and analyze data elements from one or more sources to automate this task and deliver high-performing computable phenotypes. We applied a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct a thorough scoping review on computable clinical phenotyping. Five databases were searched using a query that combined the concepts of automation, clinical context, and phenotyping. Subsequently, four reviewers screened 7960 records (after removing over 4000 duplicates) and selected 139 that satisfied the inclusion criteria. This dataset was analyzed to extract information on target use cases, data-related topics, phenotyping methodologies, evaluation strategies, and portability of developed solutions. Most studies supported patient cohort selection without discussing the application to specific use cases, such as precision medicine. Electronic Health Records were the primary source in 87.1 % (N = 121) of all studies, and International Classification of Diseases codes were heavily used in 55.4 % (N = 77) of all studies, however, only 25.9 % (N = 36) of the records described compliance with a common data model. In terms of the presented methods, traditional Machine Learning (ML) was the dominant method, often combined with natural language processing and other approaches, while external validation and portability of computable phenotypes were pursued in many cases. These findings revealed that defining target use cases precisely, moving away from sole ML strategies, and evaluating the proposed solutions in the real setting are essential opportunities for future work. There is also momentum and an emerging need for computable phenotyping to support clinical and epidemiological research and precision medicine."

This study examines whether the corpus of scientific literature from 1970 to 2023 aligns with this holistic perspective by exploring the evolving paradigms within menstrual health. Grounded in Kuhn's theoretical framework, the research delves into thematic shifts, author collaborations, and international partnerships that have emerged over the decades. Utilizing advanced text-mining methodologies, we analyzed a dataset of 34,854 documents obtained from Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science and PubMed in September 2023. These documents were processed through deduplication and data cleaning to ensure accuracy. The study employs a combination of univariate analyses, correspondence factor analyses, hierarchical cluster analyses, and network analyses to uncover insights into thematic evolution and collaborative dynamics within menstrual health research. Thematic analysis reveals three distinct periods in menstrual health research, depicting evolving paradigms. In the first period (1970-1996), the focus was on reproductive health, infertility treatments, hormonal regulation, and epidemiology. The second period (1997-2017) witnesses a transition, emphasizing menstrual health and social inequalities, gynecological studies, and contraception. The third period (2018-2023) maintains a focus on contraception and reproductive health but introduces a pronounced psychological dimension, emphasizing menstrual disorders, gynecological surgery, and socioeconomic concerns. Collaboration analysis indicates increased connectivity, consolidation of researcher communities, and a shift toward interdisciplinary approaches. While international collaborations demonstrate global commitment, geographical concentration prompts questions about paradigm universality. The study shows the existence and evolution of the menstrual health paradigm. Findings suggest a trajectory toward paradigmatic inscription, marked by heightened collaboration and global commitment. Acknowledging the pivotal role of biological aspects, the study underscores the need for a balanced, holistic understanding of menstrual health. Continued efforts are essential to tailor interventions, foster inclusivity, and honor diverse cultural and psychological realities related to menstruation."

In an introduction to predictive modelling using machine learning, we conducted a review of the recent literature that explains standard taxonomies, terminology and central concepts to a broad clinical readership. Articles aimed at readers with little or no prior experience of commonly used methods or typical workflows were summarised and key references are highlighted. Continual interdisciplinary developments in data science, biostatistics and epidemiology also motivated us to further discuss emerging topics in predictive and data-driven (hypothesis-less) analytics with machine learning. Through two methodological deep dives using examples from precision psychiatry and outcome prediction after lymphoma, we highlight how the use of, for example, natural language processing can outperform established clinical risk scores and aid dynamic prediction and adaptive care strategies. Such realistic and detailed examples allow for critical analysis of the importance of new technological advances in artificial intelligence for clinical decision-making. New clinical decision support systems can assist in prevention and care by leveraging precision medicine."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational study of patients 50 years or older in the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system from January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2019, with head computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for nonstroke indications and no history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or dementia. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was applied to the electronic health record to identify individuals with reported SBIs or WMD. Multivariable Poisson regression estimated risk ratios of demographic characteristics, RFs, and scan modality on the presence of SBIs or WMD.
RESULTS: Among 262,875 individuals, the NLP identified 13,154 (5.0%) with SBIs and 78,330 (29.8%) with WMD. Stroke RFs were highly prevalent. Advanced age was strongly associated with increased risk of SBIs (adjusted relative risks [aRRs], 1.90, 3.23, and 4.72 for those aged in their 60s, 70s, and ≥80s compared with those in their 50s) and increased risk of WMD (aRRs, 1.79, 3.02, and 4.53 for those aged in their 60s, 70s, and ≥80s compared with those in their 50s). Magnetic resonance imaging was associated with a reduced risk of SBIs (aRR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.91) and an increased risk of WMD (aRR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.83 to 2.90). Stroke RFs had modest associations with increased risk of SBIs or WMD.
CONCLUSION: An NLP algorithm can identify a large cohort of patients with incidentally discovered SBIs and WMD. Advanced age is strongly associated with incidentally discovered SBIs and WMD."

Epub 2014 Nov 17.,Nelson SD,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2015,2014/11/18,,,10.1002/pds.3720,"PURPOSE: Outpatient infusions are commonly missing in Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) pharmacy dispensing data sets. Currently, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes are used to identify outpatient infusions, but concerns exist if they correctly capture all infusions and infusion-related data such as dose and date of administration. We developed natural language processing (NLP) software to extract infusion information from medical text infusion notes. The objective was to compare the sensitivity of three approaches to identify infliximab administration dates and infusion doses against a reference standard established from the Veterans Affairs rheumatoid arthritis (VARA) registry.
METHODS: We compared the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of NLP to that of HCPCS codes in identifying the correct date and dose of infliximab infusions against a human extracted reference standard.
RESULTS: The sensitivity was 0.606 (0.585-0.627) for HCPCS alone, 0.858 (0.842-0.873) for NLP alone, and 0.923 (0.911-0.934) for the two methods combined, with a PPV of 0.735 (0.716-0.754), 0.976 (0.969-0.983), and 0.957 (0.948-0.965) for each method, respectively. The mean dose of infliximab was 433 mg in the reference standard, 337 mg from HCPCS, 434 mg from NLP, and 426 mg from the combined method.
CONCLUSIONS: HCPCS codes alone are not sufficient to accurately identify infliximab infusion dates and doses in the VHA system. The use of NLP significantly improved the sensitivity and PPV for estimating infusion dates and doses, especially when combined with HCPCS codes."

The main tracks of transmission are known; however, the relative importance of each of the components and the respective environmental risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess and specify quantitative evidence of environmental risks of leptospirosis transmission.
METHODS/FINDINGS: A database of pre-selected studies, with publication dates from 1970 until 2008, was provided by an expert group. The database has been updated until 2015 using a text mining algorithm. Study selection was based on stringent quality criteria. A descriptive data analysis was performed to calculate the medians of the log transformed odds ratios. From a selection of 2723 unique publications containing information on leptospirosis, 428 papers dealing with risk factors were identified. Of these, 53 fulfilled the quality criteria, allowing us to identify trends in different geo-climatic regions. Water associated exposures were, with few exceptions, associated with an increased leptospirosis risk. In resource poor countries, floods and rainfall were of particular importance, whereas recreational water activities were more relevant in developed countries. Rodents were associated with increased leptospirosis risk, but the variation among studies was high, which might be partly explained by differences in exposure definition. Livestock contact was commonly associated with increased risk; however, several studies found no association. The median odds ratios associated with dog and cat contacts were close to unity. Sanitation and behavioural risk factors were almost always strongly associated with leptospirosis, although their impact was rarely investigated in Europe or North America.
CONCLUSION: This review confirms the complex environmental transmission pathways of leptospirosis, as previously established. Although, floods appeared to be among the most important drivers on islands and in Asia, the consistent pattern observed for exposure to rodents and behavioural and sanitation related risk factors indicate potential areas for intervention."

Epub 2018 Jul 4.,Zheng C,Clin Exp Ophthalmol,2019,2018/06/20,,,10.1111/ceo.13340,"IMPORTANCE: Diagnosis codes are inadequate for accurately identifying herpes zoster (HZ) ophthalmicus (HZO). There is significant lack of population-based studies on HZO due to the high expense of manual review of medical records.
BACKGROUND: To assess whether HZO can be identified from the clinical notes using natural language processing (NLP). To investigate the epidemiology of HZO among HZ population based on the developed approach.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 49 914 southern California residents aged over 18 years, who had a new diagnosis of HZ.
METHODS: An NLP-based algorithm was developed and validated with the manually curated validation data set (n = 461). The algorithm was applied on over 1 million clinical notes associated with the study population. HZO versus non-HZO cases were compared by age, sex, race and co-morbidities.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the accuracy of NLP algorithm.
RESULTS: NLP algorithm achieved 95.6% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. Compared to the diagnosis codes, NLP identified significant more HZO cases among HZ population (13.9% vs. 1.7%). Compared to the non-HZO group, the HZO group was older, had more males, had more Whites and had more outpatient visits.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We developed and validated an automatic method to identify HZO cases with high accuracy. As one of the largest studies on HZO, our finding emphasizes the importance of preventing HZ in the elderly population. This method can be a valuable tool to support population-based studies and clinical care of HZO in the era of big data."

As perinatally infected children increasingly survive into adulthood, the quality of life and mental health of this population has increased in importance. This review provides a synthesis of the prevalence of mental health problems in this population and explores associated factors. A systematic database search (Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus) with an additional hand search was conducted. Peer-reviewed studies on adolescents (aged 10-19), published between 2008 and 2019, assessing mental health symptoms or psychiatric disorders, either by standardized questionnaires or by diagnostic interviews, were included. The search identified 1461 articles, of which 301 were eligible for full-text analysis. Fourteen of these, concerning HIV-positive adolescents, met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Mental health problems were highly prevalent among this group, with around 25% scoring positive for any psychiatric disorder and 30-50% showing emotional or behavioral difficulties or significant psychological distress. Associated factors found by regression analysis were older age, not being in school, impaired family functioning, HIV-related stigma and bullying, and poverty. Social support and parental competence were protective factors. Mental health problems among HIV-positive adolescents are highly prevalent and should be addressed as part of regular HIV care."

Automated algorithms that use large databases of electronic health care claims or records for surveillance are a potential means to achieve this goal. In this systematic review, we reviewed the utility, attempts at validation, and application of such algorithms to detect nonmedical opioid use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for articles describing automatable algorithms that used electronic health care claims or records to identify patients or prescribers with likely nonmedical opioid use. We assessed algorithm development, validation, and performance characteristics and the settings where they were applied. Study variability precluded a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Of 15 included algorithms, 10 targeted patients, 2 targeted providers, 2 targeted both, and 1 identified medications with high abuse potential. Most patient-focused algorithms (67%) used prescription drug claims and/or medical claims, with diagnosis codes of substance abuse and/or dependence as the reference standard. Eleven algorithms were developed via regression modeling. Four used natural language processing, data mining, audit analysis, or factor analysis.
DISCUSSION: Automated algorithms can facilitate population-level surveillance. However, there is no true gold standard for determining nonmedical opioid use. Users must recognize the implications of identifying false positives and, conversely, false negatives. Few algorithms have been applied in real-world settings.
CONCLUSION: Automated algorithms may facilitate identification of patients and/or providers most likely to need more intensive screening and/or intervention for nonmedical opioid use. Additional implementation research in real-world settings would clarify their utility."

Many in this age group report substantial obstacles to receiving quality youth-centered mental health care services. With the rapid development of technology and the recent COVID-19 pandemic, mobile health (mHealth) has presented new opportunities for youth mental health research, practice, and policy.
OBJECTIVE: The research objectives were to (1) synthesize the current evidence supporting mHealth interventions for youths who experience mental health challenges and (2) identify current gaps in the mHealth field related to youth's access to mental health services and health outcomes.
METHODS: Guided by the methods of Arksey and O'Malley, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed studies that used mHealth tools to improve youth mental health (January 2016-February 2022). We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases using the following key terms: (1) mHealth; (2) youth and young adults; and (3) mental health. The current gaps were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: The search produced 4270 records, of which 151 met inclusion criteria. Included articles highlight the comprehensive aspects of youth mHealth intervention resource allocation for targeted conditions, mHealth delivery methods, measurement tools, evaluation of mHealth intervention, and youth engagement. The median age for participants in all studies is 17 (IQR 14-21) years. Only 3 (2%) studies involved participants who reported their sex or gender outside of the binary option. Many studies (68/151, 45%) were published after the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Study types and designs varied, with 60 (40%) identified as randomized controlled trials. Notably, 143 out of 151 (95%) studies came from developed countries, suggesting an evidence shortfall on the feasibility of implementing mHealth services in lower-resourced settings. Additionally, the results highlight concerns related to inadequate resources devoted to self-harm and substance uses, weak study design, expert engagement, and the variety of outcome measures selected to capture impact or changes over time. There is also a lack of standardized regulations and guidelines for researching mHealth technologies for youths and the use of non-youth-centered approaches to implementing results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may be used to inform future work as well as the development of youth-centered mHealth tools that can be implemented and sustained over time for diverse types of youths. Implementation science research that prioritizes youths' engagement is needed to advance the current understanding of mHealth implementation. Moreover, core outcome sets may support a youth-centered measurement strategy to capture outcomes in a systematic way that prioritizes equity, diversity, inclusion, and robust measurement science. Finally, this study suggests that future practice and policy research are needed to ensure the risk of mHealth is minimized and that this innovative health care service is meeting the emerging needs of youths over time."

Epub 2021 Jun 25.,Chang RW,J Vasc Surg,2021,2021/06/28,,,10.1016/j.jvs.2021.05.054,"OBJECTIVE: Investigation of asymptomatic carotid stenosis treatment is hindered by the lack of a contemporary population-based disease cohort. We describe the use of natural language processing (NLP) to identify stenosis in patients undergoing carotid imaging.
METHODS: Adult patients with carotid imaging between 2008 and 2012 in a large integrated health care system were identified and followed through 2017. An NLP process was developed to characterize carotid stenosis according to the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (for ultrasounds) and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) (for axial imaging) guidelines. The resulting algorithm assessed text descriptors to categorize normal/non-hemodynamically significant stenosis, moderate or severe stenosis as well as occlusion in both carotid ultrasound (US) and axial imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography [CTA/MRA]). For US reports, internal carotid artery systolic and diastolic velocities and velocity ratios were assessed and matched for laterality to supplement accuracy. To validate the NLP algorithm, positive predictive value (PPV or precision) and sensitivity (recall) were calculated from simple random samples from the population of all imaging studies. Lastly, all non-normal studies were manually reviewed for confirmation for prevalence estimates and disease cohort assembly.
RESULTS: A total of 95,896 qualifying index studies (76,276 US and 19,620 CTA/MRA) were identified among 94,822 patients including 1059 patients who underwent multiple studies on the same day. For studies of normal/non-hemodynamically significant stenosis arteries, the NLP algorithm showed excellent performance with a PPV of 99% for US and 96.5% for CTA/MRA. PPV/sensitivity to identify a non-normal artery with correct laterality in the CTA/MRA and US samples were 76.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.1%-79.5%)/93.1% (95% CI, 91.1%-94.8%) and 74.7% (95% CI, 69.3%-79.5%)/94% (95% CI, 90.2%-96.7%), respectively. Regarding cohort assembly, 15,522 patients were identified with diseased carotid artery, including 2674 exhibiting equal bilateral disease. This resulted in a laterality-specific cohort with 12,828 moderate, 5283 severe, and 1895 occluded arteries and 326 diseased arteries with unknown stenosis. During follow-up, 30.1% of these patients underwent 61,107 additional studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of NLP to detect carotid stenosis or occlusion can result in accurate exclusion of normal/non-hemodynamically significant stenosis disease states with more moderate precision with lesion identification, which can substantially reduce the need for manual review. The resulting cohort allows for efficient research and holds promise for similar reporting in other vascular diseases."
32936777,Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit During COVID-19: Observational Study,"Low DM, Rumker L, Talkar T, Torous J, Cecchi G, Ghosh SS.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Oct 12;22(10):e22635. doi: 10.2196/22635.,Low DM,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/09/16,PMC7575341,,10.2196/22635,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non-mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic.
METHODS: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.
RESULTS: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ""economic stress,"" ""isolation,"" and ""home,"" while others such as ""motion"" significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=-0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged.
CONCLUSIONS: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests."

Positive, negative and neutral sentiments were included after processing 300 reviews. This approach involved analyzing the words appearing in the comments and exploring the sentiments related to daily surveillance reports of COVID-19 published on the EODY Facebook page. Moreover, machine learning algorithms were implemented to predict the classification of sentiments. This research assesses the efficiency of a few popular machine learning models, which is one of the initial efforts in Greece in this domain. People have negative sentiments toward COVID surveillance reports. Words with the highest frequency of occurrence include government, vaccinated people, unvaccinated, telephone communication, health measures, virus, COVID-19 rapid/molecular tests, and of course, COVID-19. The experimental results disclose additionally that two classifiers, namely two class Neural Network and two class Bayes Point Machine, achieved high sentiment analysis accuracy and F1 score, particularly 87% and over 35%. A significant limitation of this study may be the need for more comparison with other research attempts that identified the sentiments of the EODY surveillance reports of COVID in Greece. Machine learning models can provide critical information combating public health hazards and enrich communication strategies and proactive actions in public health issues and opinion management during the COVID-19 pandemic."

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an automatic text-processing pipeline for geospatial and temporal analysis of opioid-mentioning social media chatter.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted from December 1, 2017, to August 31, 2019, and used more than 3 years of publicly available social media posts on Twitter, dated from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2015, that were geolocated in Pennsylvania. Opioid-mentioning tweets were extracted using prescription and illicit opioid names, including street names and misspellings. Social media posts (tweets) (n = 9006) were manually categorized into 4 classes, and training and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms were performed. Temporal and geospatial patterns were analyzed with the best-performing classifier on unlabeled data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pearson and Spearman correlations of county- and substate-level abuse-indicating tweet rates with opioid overdose death rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database and with 4 metrics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 3 years were calculated. Classifier performances were measured through microaveraged F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall) or accuracies and 95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 9006 social media posts were annotated, of which 1748 (19.4%) were related to abuse, 2001 (22.2%) were related to information, 4830 (53.6%) were unrelated, and 427 (4.7%) were not in the English language. Yearly rates of abuse-indicating social media post showed statistically significant correlation with county-level opioid-related overdose death rates (n = 75) for 3 years (Pearson r = 0.451, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.331, P = .004). Abuse-indicating tweet rates showed consistent correlations with 4 NSDUH metrics (n = 13) associated with nonmedical prescription opioid use (Pearson r = 0.683, P = .01; Spearman r = 0.346, P = .25), illicit drug use (Pearson r = 0.850, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.341, P = .25), illicit drug dependence (Pearson r = 0.937, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.495, P = .09), and illicit drug dependence or abuse (Pearson r = 0.935, P < .001; Spearman r = 0.401, P = .17) over the same 3-year period, although the tests lacked power to demonstrate statistical significance. A classification approach involving an ensemble of classifiers produced the best performance in accuracy or microaveraged F1 score (0.726; 95% CI, 0.708-0.743).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The correlations obtained in this study suggest that a social media-based approach reliant on supervised machine learning may be suitable for geolocation-centric monitoring of the US opioid epidemic in near real time."

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand how NLP has been applied to Reddit (Reddit Inc) data to study opioid use.
METHODS: We systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies and conference abstracts in PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, and Association for Computing Machinery data repositories up to July 19, 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies investigating opioid use, using NLP techniques to analyze the textual corpora, and using Reddit as the social media data source. We were specifically interested in mapping studies' overarching goals and findings, methodologies and software used, and main limitations.
RESULTS: In total, 30 studies were included, which were classified into 4 nonmutually exclusive overarching goal categories: methodological (n=6, 20% studies), infodemiology (n=22, 73% studies), infoveillance (n=7, 23% studies), and pharmacovigilance (n=3, 10% studies). NLP methods were used to identify content relevant to opioid use among vast quantities of textual data, to establish potential relationships between opioid use patterns or profiles and contextual factors or comorbidities, and to anticipate individuals' transitions between different opioid-related subreddits, likely revealing progression through opioid use stages. Most studies used an embedding technique (12/30, 40%), prediction or classification approach (12/30, 40%), topic modeling (9/30, 30%), and sentiment analysis (6/30, 20%). The most frequently used programming languages were Python (20/30, 67%) and R (2/30, 7%). Among the studies that reported limitations (20/30, 67%), the most cited was the uncertainty regarding whether redditors participating in these forums were representative of people who use opioids (8/20, 40%). The papers were very recent (28/30, 93%), from 2019 to 2022, with authors from a range of disciplines.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified a wide variety of NLP techniques and applications used to support surveillance and social media interventions addressing the opioid crisis. Despite the clear potential of these methods to enable the identification of opioid-relevant content in Reddit and its analysis, there are limits to the degree of interpretive meaning that they can provide. Moreover, we identified the need for standardized ethical guidelines to govern the use of Reddit data to safeguard the anonymity and privacy of people using these forums."

Death row prisoners have high rates of mental illness, often combined with neurological impairment. Prolonged confinement has further negative effects on psychological function. There is a growing literature examining key themes and psychological constructs in death row prisoners immediately prior to execution. To date, this literature centres largely but not exclusively on last statements from death row in Texas, owing to ease of availability. The most common themes in last statements are love, spirituality and apology or regret. The most common psychological constructs are 'identification-egression' (e.g. attachment to a lost person or ideal, such as freedom), unbearable psychological pain and rejection-aggression. This is still a relatively new area of research and new techniques, such as computerised quantitative text analysis, are likely to complement rather than replace more traditional forms of thematic and textual analysis. For the future, it is essential that studies in this field continue to specify precisely, which last statements they use, so that overlap can be identified, and that more countries are studied (if possible). It would also be useful to expand the research frame to relate the content of last statements to additional variables relating to prisoners' offences, physical health, mental health, family structure and broader circumstances. Finally, ethical issues require continued consideration in this complex, fascinating, growing field."

The aim of the present systematic review was to study whether people with periodontitis/edentulism are at increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality as compared with those without periodontitis/edentulism. Cohort studies were included that 1) evaluated periodontitis or edentulism as exposures in relation to all-cause or cause-specific mortality as an outcome and 2) reported effect estimates as hazard ratios, risk ratios, or odds ratios with 95% CIs or crude numbers. Two review authors independently searched for eligible studies, screened the titles and abstracts, did full-text analysis, extracted the data from the published reports, and performed the risk-of-bias assessment. In case of disagreement, a third review author was consulted. Study results were summarized through random effects meta-analyses. A total of 57 studies were included, involving 48 cohorts and 5.71 million participants. Periodontitis was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.85]) and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (1.47 [1.14 to 1.90]), cancer (1.38 [1.24 to 1.53]), coronary heart disease (2.58 [2.20 to 3.03]), cerebrovascular diseases (3.11 [2.42 to 3.98]), but not pneumonia (0.98 [0.69 to 1.38]). Edentulism (all types) was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (1.66 [1.46 to 1.88]) and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (2.03 [1.50 to 2.74]), cancer (1.55 [1.24 to 1.94]), pneumonia (1.72 [1.07 to 2.78]), coronary heart disease (2.98 [2.43 to 3.65]), and cerebrovascular diseases (3.18 [2.24 to 4.51]). Periodontitis and its ultimate sequela (edentulism) are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (PROSPERO CRD42018100095)."

METHODS: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) software application to code clinical text documentation of overdose, including identification of intention for self-harm, substances involved, substance abuse, and error in medication usage. Using datasets balanced with cases of suspected overdose and records of individuals at elevated risk for overdose, we developed and validated the application using Kaiser Permanente Northwest data, then tested portability of the application using Kaiser Permanente Washington data. Datasets were chart-reviewed to provide a gold standard for comparison and evaluation of the automated method.
RESULTS: The method performed well in identifying overdose (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.93), intentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.98), and involvement of opioids (excluding heroin, sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.96) and heroin (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 1.0). The method performed poorly at identifying adverse drug reactions and overdose due to patient error and fairly at identifying substance abuse in opioid-related unintentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.96). Evaluation using validation datasets yielded significant reductions, in specificity and negative predictive values only, for many classifications mentioned above. However, these measures remained above 0.80, thus, performance observed during development was largely maintained during validation. Similar results were obtained when evaluating portability, although there was a significant reduction in sensitivity for unintentional overdose that was attributed to missing text clinical notes in the database.
CONCLUSIONS: Methods that process text clinical notes show promise for improving accuracy and fidelity at identifying and classifying overdoses according to type using EHR data."

Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review.
RESULTS: Smoking status (n = 27), substance use (n = 21), homelessness (n = 20), and alcohol use (n = 15) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n = 7) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n = 13), substance use (n = 9), and alcohol use (n = 9).
CONCLUSION: NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems."

Recent expert consensus has attempted to prioritize research needs and suggests greater focus on studying physical functioning of survivors. However, no analysis of the publication landscape has substantiated these proposed needs. This manuscript provides an analysis of PubMed indexed articles related to cancer rehabilitation published between 1992 and 2017. A total of 22 171 publications were analyzed using machine learning and text analysis to assess publication metrics, topic areas of emphasis, and their interrelationships through topic similarity networks. Publications have increased at a rate of 136 articles per year. Approximately 10% of publications were funded by the National Institutes of Health institutes and centers, with the National Cancer Institute being the most prominent funder. The greatest volume and rate of publication increase were in the topics of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies and Psychological Interventions, followed by Depression and Exercise Therapy. Four research topic similarity networks were identified and provide insight on areas of robust publication and notable deficits. Findings suggest that publication emphasis has strongly supported cognitive, behavioral, and psychological therapies; however, studies of functional morbidity and physical rehabilitation research are lacking. Three areas of publication deficits are noted: research on populations outside of breast, prostate, and lung cancers; methods for integrating physical rehabilitation services with cancer care, specifically regarding functional screening and assessment; and physical rehabilitation interventions. These deficits align with the needs identified by expert consensus and support the supposition that future research should emphasize a focus on physical rehabilitation."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of RA and ILD in patients with RA (RAILD) in Spain, and to compare clinical characteristics of patients with RA with and without ILD using natural language processing (NLP) on electronic health records (EHR).
METHODS: Observational case-control, retrospective and multicentre study based on the secondary use of unstructured clinical data from patients with adult RA and RAILD from nine hospitals between 2014 and 2019. NLP was used to extract unstructured clinical information from EHR and standardise it into a SNOMED-CT terminology. Prevalence of RA and RAILD were calculated, and a descriptive analysis was performed. Characteristics between patients with RAILD and RA patients without ILD (RAnonILD) were compared.
RESULTS: From a source population of 3 176 165 patients and 64 241 683 EHRs, 13 958 patients with RA were identified. Of those, 5.1% patients additionally had ILD (RAILD). The overall age-adjusted prevalence of RA and RAILD were 0.53% and 0.02%, respectively. The most common ILD subtype was usual interstitial pneumonia (29.3%). When comparing RAILD versus RAnonILD patients, RAILD patients were older and had more comorbidities, notably concerning infections (33.6% vs 16.5%, p<0.001), malignancies (15.9% vs 8.5%, p<0.001) and cardiovascular disease (25.8% vs 13.9%, p<0.001) than RAnonILD. RAILD patients also had higher inflammatory burden reflected in more pharmacological prescriptions and higher inflammatory parameters and presented a higher in-hospital mortality with a higher risk of death (HR 2.32; 95% CI 1.59 to 2.81, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found an estimated age-adjusted prevalence of RA and RAILD by analysing real-world data through NLP. RAILD patients were more vulnerable at the time of inclusion with higher comorbidity and inflammatory burden than RAnonILD, which correlated with higher mortality."

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In three medical centers with different EHR vendors, EHR-based text-mining was used to automatically screen patients for trial eligibility and extract baseline data on nineteen characteristics. First, the yield of screening with automated EHR text-mining search was compared with manual screening by research personnel. Second, the accuracy of extracted baseline data by EHR text mining was compared to manual data entry by research personnel.
RESULTS: Of the 92,466 patients visiting the out-patient cardiology departments, 568 (0.6%) were enrolled in the trial during its recruitment period using manual screening methods. Automated EHR data screening of all patients showed that the number of patients needed to screen could be reduced by 73,863 (79.9%). The remaining 18,603 (20.1%) contained 458 of the actual participants (82.4% of participants). In trial participants, automated EHR text-mining missed a median of 2.8% (Interquartile range [IQR] across all variables 0.4-8.5%) of all data points compared to manually collected data. The overall accuracy of automatically extracted data was 88.0% (IQR 84.7-92.8%).
CONCLUSION: Automatically extracting data from EHRs using text-mining can be used to identify trial participants and to collect baseline information."

Epub 2022 Jun 26.,Robles LA,Cancer Causes Control,2022,2022/06/26,PMC9270305,,10.1007/s10552-022-01591-w,"PURPOSE: Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown an association between vitamin D levels and prostate cancer progression. However, evidence of direct causality is sparse and studies have not examined biological mechanisms, which can provide information on plausibility and strengthen the evidence for causality.
METHODS: We used the World Cancer Research Fund International/University of Bristol two-stage framework for mechanistic systematic reviews. In stage one, both text mining of published literature and expert opinion identified testosterone as a plausible biological mechanism. In stage two, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence from both human and animal studies examining the effect of vitamin D on testosterone, and testosterone on advanced prostate cancer (diagnostic Gleason score of ≥ 8, development of metastasis) or prostate cancer-specific mortality.
RESULTS: A meta-analysis of ten human RCTs showed evidence of an effect of vitamin D on total testosterone (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.133, 95% CI =  - 0.003-0.269, I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.056). Five human RCTs showed evidence of an effect of vitamin D on free testosterone (SMD = 0.173, 95% CI =  - 0.104-0.450, I2 = 52.4%, p = 0.220). Three human cohort studies of testosterone on advanced prostate cancer or prostate cancer-specific mortality provided inconsistent results. In one study, higher levels of calculated free testosterone were positively associated with advanced prostate cancer or prostate cancer-specific mortality. In contrast, higher levels of dihydrotestosterone were associated with lowering prostate cancer-specific mortality in another study. No animal studies met the study eligibility criteria.
CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that vitamin D increases levels of total and free testosterone, although the effect of testosterone levels within the normal range on prostate cancer progression is unclear. The role of testosterone as a mechanism between vitamin D and prostate cancer progression remains inconclusive."

Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents an opportunity to create large datasets to facilitate research in this area. This is a challenging endeavour however, because of the wide range of ways in which these symptoms are recorded, and the overlap of terms used to describe OCS with those used to describe other conditions. We developed an NLP algorithm to extract OCS information from a large mental healthcare EHR data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust using its Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) facility. We extracted documents from individuals who had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These text documents, annotated by human coders, were used for developing and refining the NLP algorithm (600 documents) with an additional set reserved for final validation (300 documents). The developed NLP algorithm utilized a rules-based approach to identify each of symptoms associated with OCS, and then combined them to determine the overall number of instances of OCS. After its implementation, the algorithm was shown to identify OCS with a precision and recall (with 95% confidence intervals) of 0.77 (0.65-0.86) and 0.67 (0.55-0.77) respectively. The development of this application demonstrated the potential to extract complex symptomatic data from mental healthcare EHRs using NLP to facilitate further analyses of these clinical symptoms and their relevance for prognosis and intervention response."

This systematic review was undertaken to assess evidence of herpes virus-related morbidity and mortality in burns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched to identify studies of HSV, CMV, or VZV infections in burn patients. Exclusion criteria included: A level of evidence (LoE) of IV or V; nonhuman in vivo studies; and non-English articles. There was no limitation by publication date.
RESULTS: Fifty articles were subjected to full-text analysis. Of these, 18 had LoE between I-III and were included in the final review (2 LoE I, 16 LoE II-III). Eight had a prospective study design, 9 had a retrospective study design, and 1 included both.
CONCLUSIONS: No direct evidence linked CMV and HSV infection with increased morbidity and mortality in burns. Following burn, CMV reactivation was more common than a primary CMV infection. Active HSV infection impaired wound healing but was not directly correlated to mortality. Infections with VZV are rare after burns but when they occur, VZV infections were associated with severe complications including mortality. The therapeutic effect of antiviral agents administered after burns warrants investigation via prospective randomized controlled trials."
31804782,Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User Study,"Gartlehner G, Wagner G, Lux L, Affengruber L, Dobrescu A, Kaminski-Hartenthaler A, Viswanathan M.",Rockville (MD): Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US); 2019 Nov. Report No.: 19(20)-EHC026-EF.,Gartlehner G,Assessing the Accuracy of Machine-Assisted Abstract Screening With DistillerAI: A User Study,2019,2019/11/01,,,,"BACKGROUND: Web applications that employ natural language processing technologies such as text mining and text classification to support systematic reviewers during abstract screening have become more user friendly and more common. Such semi-automated screening tools can increase efficiency by reducing the number of abstracts needed to screen or by replacing one screener after adequately training the algorithm of the machine. Savings in workload between 30 percent and 70 percent might be possible with the use of such tools. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool.
METHODS: To address our objective, we evaluated the accuracy of a machine-assisted screening approach using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review as the reference standard. We chose DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool for our project, applying its naïve Bayesian machine-learning option. Five teams screened the same 2,472 abstracts in parallel, using the machine-assisted approach. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For the remaining 2,172 abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener in each team and provided predictions about the relevance of records. We used a prediction score of 0.5 (i.e., inconclusive) or greater to classify a record as an inclusion. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening (i.e., no machine assistance), and screening with DistillerAI alone (i.e., no human involvement after training) against the reference standard and calculated sensitivities, specificities, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. In addition, we determined the interrater agreement, the proportion of included abstracts, and the number of conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI.
RESULTS: The mean sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 66% to 90%), and the mean specificity was 95 percent (95% CI, 92% to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was also 78 percent (95% CI, 66% to 89%); the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was 14 percent (95% CI, 0% to 31%). Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI alone were 94 percent (95% CI, 91% to 97%) and 98 percent (95% CI, 97% to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86).
DISCUSSION: Findings of our study indicate that the accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening. The approach that we tested missed too many relevant studies and created too many conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews."

We present the results of a scoping review which combines the use of a novel artificial-intelligence-(AI)-assisted Medline search tool with two other 'traditional' literature search methods. We illustrate this novel approach with a case study to identify and map the range of conditions (clinical presentations, complications, coinfections and health problems) associated with gonorrhoea infection.
METHODS: To fully characterize the range of health outcomes associated with gonorrhoea, we combined a high yield preliminary search with a traditional systematic search, then supplemented with the output of a novel AI-assisted Medline search tool based on natural language processing methods to identify eligible literature.
RESULTS: We identified 189 health conditions associated with gonorrhoea infection of which: 53 were identified through the initial 'high yield' search; 99 through the systematic search; and 124 through the AI-assisted search. These were extracted from 107 unique references and 21 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD 9/10) or Read codes. Health conditions were mapped to the urogenital tract (n = 86), anorectal tract (n = 6) oropharyngeal tract (n = 5) and the eye (n = 14); and other conditions such as systemic (n = 61) and neonatal conditions (n = 7), psychosocial associations (n = 3), and co-infections (n = 7). The 107 unique references attained a Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) score of ≥2++ (n = 2), 2+ (14 [13%]), 2- (30 [28%]) and 3 (45 [42%]), respectively. The remaining papers (n = 16) were reviews.
CONCLUSIONS: Through AI screening of Medline, we captured - titles, abstracts, case reports and case series related to rare but serious health conditions related to gonorrhoea infection. These outcomes might otherwise have been missed during a systematic search. The AI-assisted search provided a useful addition to traditional/manual literature searches especially when rapid results are required in an exploratory setting."

METHODS: This was a random-sample retrospective observational cohort study leveraging unstructured data from injured patients taken to one of 9 acute care hospitals in an integrated health system between 2015 and 2021. Patients with International Classification of Diseases External Cause of Morbidity codes were identified. History and physical, consult, progress, and radiology report text from the first 8 hours of care were abstracted. Annotator dyads independently annotated encounters' text files to establish ground truth regarding whether intra-abdominal injury occurred. Features were extracted from text using natural language processing techniques, bag of words, and principal component analysis. We tested logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machine to determine accuracy, recall, and precision of natural language processing to predict intra-abdominal injury.
RESULTS: A random sample of 7,000 patient encounters of 177,127 was annotated. Only 2,951 had sufficient information to determine whether an intra-abdominal injury was present. Among those, 84 (2.9%) had an intra-abdominal injury. The concordance between annotators was 0.989. Logistic regression of features identified with bag of words and principal component analysis had the best predictive ability, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9, recall of 0.73, and precision of 0.17. Text features with greatest importance included ""abdomen,"" ""pelvis,"" ""spleen,"" and ""hematoma.""
CONCLUSION: Natural language processing could be a screening decision support tool, which, if paired with human clinical assessment, can maximize precision of intra-abdominal injury identification."

In addition to identifying the risk factors, this track of the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task studied the presence and progression of the risk factors in longitudinal medical records. Twenty teams participated in this track, and submitted 49 system runs for evaluation. Six of the top 10 teams achieved F1 scores over 0.90, and all 10 scored over 0.87. The most successful system used a combination of additional annotations, external lexicons, hand-written rules and Support Vector Machines. The results of this track indicate that identification of risk factors and their progression over time is well within the reach of automated systems."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a distributed, federated network of 12 health systems that harmonized their EHRs and submitted aggregate answers to consortia questions posted at https://www.covid19questions.org. Our consortium developed processes and implemented distributed algorithms to produce answers to a variety of questions. We were able to generate counts, descriptive statistics, and build a multivariate, iterative regression model without centralizing individual-level data.
RESULTS: Our public website contains answers to various clinical questions, a web form for users to ask questions in natural language, and a list of items that are currently pending responses. The results show, for example, that patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, within the year before admission, had lower unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates. We also showed that, when adjusted for, age, sex, and ethnicity were not significantly associated with mortality. We demonstrated that it is possible to answer questions about COVID-19 using EHR data from systems that have different policies and must follow various regulations, without moving data out of their health systems.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: We present an alternative or a complement to centralized COVID-19 registries of EHR data. We can use multivariate distributed logistic regression on observations recorded in the process of care to generate results without transferring individual-level data outside the health systems."

Substantial costs are attributed to the care of patients with syncope. Current challenges include differentiating syncope from its mimickers, identifying serious underlying conditions that caused the syncope, and wide variations in current management. Although validated risk tools exist, especially for short-term prognosis, there is inconsistent application, and the current approach does not meet patient needs and expectations. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as machine learning methods including natural language processing, can potentially address the current challenges in syncope management. Preliminary evidence from published studies indicates that it is possible to accurately differentiate syncope from its mimickers and predict short-term prognosis and hospitalisation. More recently, AI analysis of electrocardiograms has shown promise in detection of serious structural and functional cardiac abnormalities, which has the potential to improve syncope care. Future AI studies have the potential to address current issues in syncope management. AI can automatically prognosticate risk in real time by accessing traditional and nontraditional data. However, steps to mitigate known problems such as generalisability, patient privacy, data protection, and liability will be needed. In the past AI has had limited impact due to underdeveloped analytical methods, lack of computing power, poor access to powerful computing systems, and availability of reliable high-quality data. All impediments except data have been solved. AI will live up to its promise to transform syncope care if the health care system can satisfy AI requirement of large scale, robust, accurate, and reliable data."

We conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the penetrance of MBC susceptibility genes to better summarize current estimates of penetrance.
METHODS: A search query was developed to identify MBC-related papers indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE. A validated natural language processing method was applied to identify papers reporting penetrance estimates. These penetrance studies' bibliographies were reviewed to ensure comprehensiveness. We accessed the potential ascertainment bias for each enrolled study.
RESULTS: Fifteen penetrance studies were identified from 12,182 abstracts, covering five purported MBC susceptibility genes: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and PALB2. Cohort (n = 6, 40%) and case-control (n = 5, 33%) studies were the two most common study designs, followed by family-based (n = 3, 20%), and a kin-cohort study (n = 1, 7%). Seven of the 15 studies (47%) adjusted for ascertainment adequately and therefore the MBC risks reported by these seven studies can be considered applicable to the general population. Based on these seven studies, we found pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2 c.1100delC, and PALB2 show an increased risk for MBC. The association between BRCA1 and MBC was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: This work supports the conclusion that pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2 c.1100delC, and PALB2 increase the risk of MBC, whereas pathogenic variants in BRCA1 may not be associated with increased MBC risk."

Nevertheless, not all relevant indicators can be calculated with this data alone. Our feasibility study objective is to analyze 1) the availability of data sources; 2) the availability of each indicator elementary variables, and 3) to apply natural language processing to automatically retrieve such information.
METHOD: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional observational feasibility study on the clinical data warehouse of Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP). We studied the management of breast cancer patients treated at AP-HP between January 2019 and June 2021, and the quality indicators published by the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialist, using claims data from the Programme de Médicalisation du Système d'Information (PMSI) and pathology reports. For each indicator, we calculated the number (%) of patients for whom all necessary data sources were available, and the number (%) of patients for whom all elementary variables were available in the sources, and for whom the related HQSI was computable. To extract useful data from the free text reports, we developed and validated dedicated rule-based algorithms, whose performance metrics were assessed with recall, precision, and f1-score.
RESULTS: Out of 5785 female patients diagnosed with a breast cancer (60.9 years, IQR [50.0-71.9]), 5,147 (89.0%) had procedures related to breast cancer recorded in the PMSI, and 3732 (72.5%) had at least one surgery. Out of the 34 key indicators, 9 could be calculated with the PMSI alone, and 6 others became so using the data from pathology reports. Ten elementary variables were needed to calculate the 6 indicators combining the PMSI and pathology reports. The necessary sources were available for 58.8% to 94.6% of patients, depending on the indicators. The extraction algorithms developed had an average accuracy of 76.5% (min-max [32.7%-93.3%]), an average precision of 77.7% [10.0%-97.4%] and an average sensitivity of 71.6% [2.8% to 100.0%]. Once these algorithms applied, the variables needed to calculate the indicators were extracted for 2% to 88% of patients, depending on the indicators.
DISCUSSION: The availability of medical reports in the electronic health records, of the elementary variables within the reports, and the performance of the extraction algorithms limit the population for which the indicators can be calculated.
CONCLUSIONS: The automated calculation of quality indicators from electronic health records is a prospect that comes up against many practical obstacles."

BACKGROUND: Identification of patients with cirrhosis by manual data collection is time-intensive and laborious, whereas using ICD-9 codes can be inaccurate. NLP, a novel computerized approach to analyzing electronic free text, has been used to automatically identify patient cohorts with gastrointestinal pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease. This methodology has not yet been used in cirrhosis.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles Health, an academic medical center. A total of 5343 University of California, Los Angeles primary care patients with ICD-9 codes for chronic liver disease were identified during March 2013 to January 2015. An algorithm incorporating NLP of radiology reports, ICD-9 codes, and laboratory data determined whether these patients had cirrhosis. Of the 5343 patients, 168 patient charts were manually reviewed at random as a gold standard comparison. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the algorithm and each of its steps were calculated.
RESULTS: The algorithm's PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.78%, 96.84%, 95.71%, and 93.88%, respectively. The NLP portion was the most important component of the algorithm with PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.44%, 93.27%, 90.00%, and 98.98%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: NLP is a powerful tool that can be combined with administrative and laboratory data to identify patients with cirrhosis within a population."

They can be used to recognize communication and behavioral themes of problematic use of prescription drugs. However, mining and analyzing social media data have challenges and limitations related to topic deduction and data quality. As a result, we need a structured approach to analyze social media content related to drug abuse in a manner that can mitigate the challenges and limitations surrounding the use of such data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a framework for mining and analyzing social media content related to drug abuse. The framework is designed to mitigate challenges and limitations related to topic deduction and data quality in social media data analytics for drug abuse.
METHODS: The proposed framework started with defining different terms related to the keywords, categories, and characteristics of the topic of interest. We then used the Crimson Hexagon platform to collect data based on a search query informed by a drug abuse ontology developed using the identified terms. We subsequently preprocessed the data and examined the quality using an evaluation matrix. Finally, a suitable data analysis approach could be used to analyze the collected data.
RESULTS: The framework was evaluated using the opioid epidemic as a drug abuse case analysis. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework to identify public concerns toward the opioid epidemic and the most discussed topics on social media related to opioids. The results from the case analysis showed that the framework could improve the discovery and identification of topics in social media domains characterized by a plethora of highly diverse terms and lack of a commonly available dictionary or language by the community, such as in the case of opioid and drug abuse.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework addressed the challenges related to topic detection and data quality. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework to identify the common concerns toward the opioid epidemic and the most discussed topics on social media related to opioids."

Epub 2017 Apr 25.,Karystianis G,J Biomed Inform,2017,2017/04/30,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.04.004,"INTRODUCTION: Most data extraction efforts in epidemiology are focused on obtaining targeted information from clinical trials. In contrast, limited research has been conducted on the identification of information from observational studies, a major source for human evidence in many fields, including environmental health. The recognition of key epidemiological information (e.g., exposures) through text mining techniques can assist in the automation of systematic reviews and other evidence summaries.
METHOD: We designed and applied a knowledge-driven, rule-based approach to identify targeted information (study design, participant population, exposure, outcome, confounding factors, and the country where the study was conducted) from abstracts of epidemiological studies included in several systematic reviews of environmental health exposures. The rules were based on common syntactical patterns observed in text and are thus not specific to any systematic review. To validate the general applicability of our approach, we compared the data extracted using our approach versus hand curation for 35 epidemiological study abstracts manually selected for inclusion in two systematic reviews.
RESULTS: The returned F-score, precision, and recall ranged from 70% to 98%, 81% to 100%, and 54% to 97%, respectively. The highest precision was observed for exposure, outcome and population (100%) while recall was best for exposure and study design with 97% and 89%, respectively. The lowest recall was observed for the population (54%), which also had the lowest F-score (70%).
CONCLUSION: The generated performance of our text-mining approach demonstrated encouraging results for the identification of targeted information from observational epidemiological study abstracts related to environmental exposures. We have demonstrated that rules based on generic syntactic patterns in one corpus can be applied to other observational study design by simple interchanging the dictionaries aiming to identify certain characteristics (i.e., outcomes, exposures). At the document level, the recognised information can assist in the selection and categorization of studies included in a systematic review."

We reviewed all studies on postoperative complications and survival after resection of pNET. A systematic search was performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2000-2013. Inclusion criteria were studies of resected pNET, which described postoperative complications separately for each surgical procedure and/or 5-year survival after resection. Prospective and retrospective studies were pooled separately and overall pooled if heterogeneity was below 75%. The random-effect model was used. Overall, 2643 studies were identified and after full-text analysis 62 studies were included. Pancreatic fistula (PF) rate of the prospective studies after tumor enucleation was 45%; PF-rates after distal pancreatectomy, pancreatoduodenectomy, or central pancreatectomy were, respectively, 14-14-58%. Delayed gastric emptying rates were, respectively, 5-5-18-16%. Postoperative hemorrhage rates were, respectively, 6-1-7-4%. In-hospital mortality rates were, respectively, 3-4-6-4%. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of resected pNET without synchronous resected liver metastases were, respectively, 85-93%. Heterogeneity between included studies on 5-year OS in patients with synchronous resected liver metastases was too high to pool all studies. The 5-year DSS in patients with liver metastases was 80%. Morbidity after pancreatic resection for pNET was mainly caused by PF. Liver resection in patients with liver metastases seems to have a positive effect on DSS. To reduce heterogeneity, ISGPS criteria and uniform patient groups should be used in the analysis of postoperative outcome and survival."

Investigating the association between liver fibrosis and type of HF, specifically HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF; HFrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), may provide mechanistic insight into this association. We sought to determine the association between liver fibrosis score (FIB-4) and type of HF, and to assess whether HIV or hepatitis C status modified this association.
METHODS: We included patients alive on or after 4/1/2003 from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study. We followed patients without prevalent cardiovascular disease until their first HF event, death, last clinic visit, or 9/30/2015. We defined liver fibrosis as: likely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 > 3.25), indeterminate (FIB-4 range 1.45-3.25), unlikely advanced fibrosis (FIB-4 < 1.45). Primary outcomes were HFrEF and HFpEF (defined using ICD-9 diagnoses for HF, and EF extracted from electronic medical records using natural language processing). Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for potential confounders and used to estimate hazard ratios (HR).
RESULTS: Among 108,708 predominantly male (96%) participants mean age was 49 years. Likely advanced fibrosis was present in 4% at baseline and was associated with an increased risk of HFpEF [HR (95% confidence interval)] [1.70 (1.3-2.3)]; and non-significantly with HFrEF [1.20 (0.9-1.7)]. These associations were not modified by HIV or hepatitis C status.
CONCLUSION: Likely advanced fibrosis was independently associated with incident HFpEF but not HFrEF. This suggests that risk factors and/or mechanisms for liver fibrosis may have greater overlap with those for HFpEF than HFrEF."

However, only a few bibliometric analyses have been conducted in this area. In this review, we used CiteSpace 5.7. R2 and VOSviewer 1.6.17 software to perform text mining and knowledge map analysis. This study summarizes the latest progress, development paths, frontier research hotspots, and future research trends in this field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies on efferocytosis in cardiovascular diseases were downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection.
RESULTS: In total, 327 studies published by 506 institutions across 42 countries and regions were identified. The number of studies on efferocytosis in cardiovascular diseases has increased over time. Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology published the highest number of articles and was the top co-cited journal. Tabas Ira. was the most prolific researcher and co-cited the most. The most productive countries were the United States and China. Columbia University, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham Women's Hospital were the 3 most productive institutions in the field of research. Keyword Co-occurrence, Clusters, and Burst analyses showed that inflammation, atherosclerosis, macrophages, and phagocytosis appeared with the highest frequency in these studies.
CONCLUSION: Multinational cooperation and multidisciplinary intersections are characteristic trends of development in the field, and the immune microenvironment, glycolysis, and lipid metabolism will be the focus of future research."

Online ahead of print.,Stang A,Eur J Epidemiol,2023,2023/09/16,PMC10570208,,10.1007/s10654-023-01047-8,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the time trend of statistical inference, statistical reporting style of results, and effect measures from the abstracts of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
STUDY DESGIN AND SETTINGS: We downloaded 385,867 PubMed abstracts of RCTs from 1975 to 2021. We used text-mining to detect reporting of statistical inference (p-values, confidence intervals, significance terminology), statistical reporting style of results, and effect measures for binary outcomes, including time-to-event measures. We validated the text mining algorithms by random samples of abstracts.
RESULTS: A total of 320 676 abstracts contained statistical inference. The percentage of abstracts including statistical inference increased from 65% (1975) to 87% (2006) and then decreased slightly. From 1975 to 1990, the sole reporting of language regarding statistical significance was predominant. Since 1990, reporting of p-values without confidence intervals has been the most common reporting style. Reporting of confidence intervals increased from 0.5% (1975) to 29% (2021). The two most common effect measures for binary outcomes were hazard ratios and odds ratios. Number needed to treat and number needed to harm are reported in less than 5% of abstracts with binary endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of statistical inference in abstracts of RCTs has increased over time. Increasingly, p-values and confidence intervals are reported rather than just mentioning the presence of ""statistical significance"". The reporting of odds ratios comes with the liability that the untrained reader will interpret them as risk ratios, which is often not justified, especially in RCTs."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied hyperglycemic adults with diabetes treated at primary care practices between 2000 and 2014. We analyzed the relationship between frequency of lifestyle counseling (identified using natural language processing of electronic notes) and a composite outcome of death and cardiovascular events during subsequent follow-up.
RESULTS: Among patients with monthly counseling or more, 10-year cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 33.0% compared with 38.1% for less than monthly counseling (P = 0.0005). In multivariable analysis, higher frequency of lifestyle counseling was associated with lower incidence of the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.88 [95% CI 0.82-0.94]; P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: More frequent lifestyle counseling was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events and death among patients with diabetes."

Epub 2019 Aug 7.,Gavrielov-Yusim N,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2019,2019/08/09,,,10.1002/pds.4857,"PURPOSE: Adverse event (AE) identification in social media (SM) can be performed using various types of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ML methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex NLP and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and NLP to identify AEs and signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) in patient-generated SM. We also examined the performance of lift in SM-based signal detection (SD).
METHODS: Our examination was performed in a corpus of SM posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported VigiBase data as reference data set.
RESULTS: We found that co-occurrence and NLP produce AEs, which are 57% and 93% consistent with VigiBase AEs, respectively. Among the SDRs identified both in SM and in VigiBase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in NLP-processed SM. Using lift in SM SD provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in NLP-processed AEs.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that using SM as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further. Various levels of SM processing may be considered, depending on the preferred policies and tolerance for false-positive to false-negative balance in routine pharmacovigilance processes."

We explored associations between ADR and characteristics of endoscopists, including personality traits and financial incentives.
METHODS: We collected electronic health record data from October 2013 through September 2015 and calculated ADRs for physicians from 4 health systems. ADRs were risk-adjusted for differences in patient populations. Physicians were surveyed to assess financial motivations, knowledge and perceptions about colonoscopy quality, and personality traits. Of 140 physicians sent the survey, 117 responded.
RESULTS: The median risk-adjusted ADR for all surveyed physicians was 29.3% (interquartile range, 24.1%-35.5%). We found no significant association between ADR and financial incentives, malpractice concerns, or physicians' perceptions of ADR as a quality metric. ADR was associated with the degree of self-reported compulsiveness relative to peers: among endoscopists who described themselves as much more compulsive, the ADR was 33.1%; among those who described themselves as somewhat more compulsive, the ADR was 32.9%; among those who described themselves as about the same as others, the ADR was 26.4%; and among those who described themselves as somewhat less compulsive, the ADR was 27.3%) (P = .0019). ADR was also associated with perceived thoroughness (much more thorough than peers, ADR = 31.5%; somewhat more, 31.9%; same/somewhat less, 27.1%; P = .0173). Physicians who reported feeling rushed, having difficulty pacing themselves, or having difficulty in accomplishing goals had higher ADRs. A secondary analysis found the same associations between personality and adenomas per colonoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant association between ADR and financial incentives, malpractice concerns, or perceptions of ADR as a quality metric. However, ADRs were higher among physicians who described themselves as more compulsive or thorough, and among those who reported feeling rushed or having difficulty accomplishing goals."

Epub 2019 Apr 24.,Green CA,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2019,2019/04/26,PMC6767606,,10.1002/pds.4772,"PURPOSE: The study aims to develop and validate algorithms to identify and classify opioid overdoses using claims and other coded data, and clinical text extracted from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP).
METHODS: Primary data were derived from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (2008-2014), an integrated health care system (~n > 475 000 unique individuals per year). Data included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for nonfatal diagnoses, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for fatal events, clinical notes, and prescription medication records. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in Kaiser Permanente Washington, Tennessee State Medicaid, and Optum.
RESULTS: Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivity = 97.2%, specificity = 84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivity = 91.8%, specificity = 99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivity = 70.7%, specificity = 90.5%); sensitivity improved with NLP (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 79.5%); sensitivity improved with the NLP-enhanced algorithm (sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%.
CONCLUSIONS: Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The NLP-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use NLP."

Reports from ∼70 countries identified >1300 human genes associated with either the Core, Surface or X gene in HBV-associated HCC. One hundred and forty-three of these host genes, which can potentially yield 1180 biomolecular interactions, each were reported in at least three different publications to be associated with the same HBV. These 143 genes function in 137 pathways, involved mainly in the cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation and signalling. Fourteen of these molecules, primarily transcriptional regulators or kinases, play roles in several pathways pertinent to the hallmarks of cancers. 'Chronic' was the most frequent word used across the 9249 abstracts. A key event in chronic HBV infection is the integration of HBV into the host genome. The advent of cost-effective, next-generation sequencing technology facilitated the employment of big-data analytics comprehensively to characterize HBV-host integration within HCC patients. A total of 5331 integration events were reported across seven publications, with most of these integrations observed between the Core/X gene and the introns of genes. Nearly one-quarter of the intergenic integrations are within repeats, especially long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) repeats. Integrations within 13 genes were each reported by at least three different studies. The human gene with the most HBV integrations observed is the TERT gene where a total of 224 integrations, primarily at its promoter and within the tumour tissue, were reported by six of seven publications. This unique review, which employs state-of-the-art text-mining and data-analytics tools, represents the most complete, systematic and comprehensive review of nearly all the publications associated with HBV-associated HCC research. It provides important resources to either focus future research or develop therapeutic strategies to target key molecules reported to play important roles in key pathways of HCC, through the systematic analyses of the commonly reported molecules associated with the various HBV genes in HCC, including information about the interactions amongst these commonly reported molecules, the pathways in which they reside as well as detailed information regarding the viral and host genes associated with HBV integration in HCC patients. Hence this review, which highlights pathways and key human genes associated with HBV in HCC, may facilitate the deeper elucidation of the role of HBV in hepato-carcinogenesis, potentially leading to timely intervention against this deadly disease."

Four Online database (PubMed, OVID, Scopus and Emcare) were searched for studies that assessed oral cancer awareness amongst patients attending Australian university-associated (teaching) clinics. A total of five articles were retrieved for full-text analysis. All studies showed significant variation in patient awareness and understanding regarding the principal risk factors associated with oral cancer development. Smoking was predominantly identified as a significant risk factor, but alcohol consumption was less frequently recognized as relevant. Non-healing ulceration was most commonly identified as a symptom of concern, whilst red and/or white mucosal patches were infrequently recognized as potentially malignant conditions. Our review confirms that a significant lack of patient awareness regarding oral cancer risk and the signs /symptoms of early malignancy or potentially malignant disease exist in patients attending dental teaching clinics. Important opportunities exist to involve dental students proactively in raising oral cancer awareness, delivering smoking cessation interventions and safe alcohol consumption advice to their patients. Incorporation of established health educational models might deliver effective support for such student-delivered patient education."

For predicting life expectancy, physicians have been shown to outperform traditional models that use only a few predictor variables. It is possible that a machine learning model that uses many predictor variables and diverse data sources from the electronic medical record can improve on physicians' performance. For patients with metastatic cancer, we compared accuracy of life expectancy predictions by the treating physician, a machine learning model, and a traditional model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A machine learning model was trained using 14 600 metastatic cancer patients' data to predict each patient's distribution of survival time. Data sources included note text, laboratory values, and vital signs. From 2015-2016, 899 patients receiving radiotherapy for metastatic cancer were enrolled in a study in which their radiation oncologist estimated life expectancy. Survival predictions were also made by the machine learning model and a traditional model using only performance status. Performance was assessed with area under the curve for 1-year survival and calibration plots.
RESULTS: The radiotherapy study included 1190 treatment courses in 899 patients. A total of 879 treatment courses in 685 patients were included in this analysis. Median overall survival was 11.7 months. Physicians, machine learning model, and traditional model had area under the curve for 1-year survival of 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.81), 0.77 (0.73-0.81), and 0.68 (0.65-0.71), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model's predictions were more accurate than those of the treating physician or a traditional model."

These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type. This literature and software review covering this broad topic is aligned with the scoping review methodology. The manual identification of data sources has been complemented with: (1) automated publication search through digital libraries of the three major publishers using natural language processing (NLP) Toolkit, and (2) an automated identification of relevant software repositories on GitHub and ranking of the related research papers relying on learning to rank approach."

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study design of patients hospitalised in 2015 from four hospitals participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study was used to determine NLP performance in the ascertainment of Framingham HF criteria and phenotype.
SETTING: Four ARIC study hospitals, each representing an ARIC study region in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A stratified random sample of hospitalisations identified using a broad range of International Classification of Disease, ninth revision, diagnostic codes indicative of an HF event and occurring during 2015 was drawn for this study. A randomly selected set of 394 hospitalisations was used as the derivation dataset and 406 hospitalisations was used as the validation dataset.
INTERVENTION: Use of NLP on free-text clinical notes and reports to ascertain Framingham HF criteria and phenotype.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: NLP performance as measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and agreement in ascertainment of Framingham HF criteria and phenotype. Manual medical record review by trained ARIC abstractors was used as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Overall, performance of NLP ascertainment of Framingham HF phenotype in the validation dataset was good, with 78.8%, 81.7%, 84.4% and 80.0% for sensitivity, specificity, PPV and agreement, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: By decreasing the need for manual chart review, our results on the use of NLP to ascertain Framingham HF phenotype from free-text electronic health record data suggest that validated NLP technology holds the potential for significantly improving the feasibility and efficiency of conducting large-scale epidemiologic surveillance of HF prevalence and incidence."

Malnutrition is a highly associated predictive factor of dysphagia as well as one of the most common symptoms caused by dysphagia. Thus, the two conditions may exist simultaneously but also influence each other negatively and quickly cause functional decline especially in older adults. The purpose of this review was to determine whether institutions have established a protocol combining screenings for dysphagia and malnutrition on a global scale. If combined screening protocols have been implemented, the respective derived measures will be reported.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted. A systematic database search was carried out in January and February 2024. Studies were included that examined adult hospitalized patients who were systematically screened for dysphagia and malnutrition. The results were managed through the review software tool Covidence. The screening of titles and abstracts was handled independently by two reviewers; conflicts were discussed and resolved by consensus between three authors. This procedure was retained for full-text analysis and extraction. The extraction template was piloted and revised following feedback prior to extraction, which was carried out in February 2024.
RESULTS: A total of 2014 studies were found, 1075 of which were included for abstract screening, 80 for full text screening. In the end, 27 studies were extracted and reported following the reporting guideline PRISMA with the extension for Scoping Reviews.
CONCLUSION: Most of the studies considered the prevalence and association of dysphagia and malnutrition with varying outcomes such as nutritional status, pneumonia, oral nutrition, and swallowing function. Only two studies had implemented multi-professional nutrition teams."

Using narrative clinical notes from all Maine Health Information Exchange (HIE) patients, the NLP case finding algorithm was retrospectively (July 1, 2012-June 30, 2013) developed with a random subset of HIE associated facilities, and blind-tested with the remaining facilities. The NLP based method was integrated into a live HIE population exploration system and validated prospectively (July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014). Total of 18,295 codified CHF patients were included in Maine HIE. Among the 253,803 subjects without CHF codings, our case finding algorithm prospectively identified 2411 uncodified CHF cases. The positive predictive value (PPV) is 0.914, and 70.1% of these 2411 cases were found to be with CHF histories in the clinical notes.
CONCLUSIONS: A CHF case finding algorithm was developed, tested and prospectively validated. The successful integration of the CHF case findings algorithm into the Maine HIE live system is expected to improve the Maine CHF care."

Expert opinion derived risk scales are routinely used in research and clinical practice to quantify anticholinergic burden. These scales rank the anticholinergic activity of medicines into four categories, ranging from no anticholinergic activity (= 0) to definite/high anticholinergic activity (= 3). The aim of this systematic review was to compare anticholinergic burden quantified by the anticholinergic risk scales and evaluate associations with adverse outcomes in older people.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO from 1984-2014 to identify expert opinion derived anticholinergic risk scales. In addition to this, a citation analysis was performed in Web of Science and Google Scholar to track prospective citing of references of selected articles for assessment of individual scales for adverse anticholinergic outcomes. The primary outcomes of interest were functional and cognitive outcomes associated with anticholinergic burden in older people. The critical appraisals of the included studies were performed by two independent reviewers and the data were extracted onto standardised forms.
RESULTS: The primary electronic literature search identified a total of 1250 records in the 3 different databases. On the basis of full-text analysis, we identified 7 expert-based anticholinergic rating scales that met the inclusion criteria. The rating of anticholinergic activity for medicines among these rating scales was inconsistent. For example, quetiapine was rated as having high anticholinergic activity in one scale (n = 1), moderate in another scale (n = 1) and low in two other scales (n = 2). Citation analysis of the individual scales showed that the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale was the most frequently validated expert based anticholinergic scale for adverse outcomes (N = 13).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, there is not one standardised tool for measuring anticholinergic burden. Cohort studies have shown that higher anticholinergic burden is associated with negative brain effects, poorer cognitive and functional outcomes."

This systematic review aimed to determine the impact of oral health education interventions on the incidence and severity of OM. Bibliographical searches were carried out by two independent examiners in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Virtual Health Library, and SIGLE, until June 2022. The eligibility criteria were based on the PICO strategy, considering studies with pediatric oncology patients, aged 0 to 19 years, who had attended oral health education activities and had been examined for the incidence and/or severity of OM. Data were extracted for qualitative synthesis and organized in spreadsheets. The quality assessment of the selected studies was performed using the ROBINS-I tool. Meta-analysis was based on the group frequencies of OM ulcerative lesions, adopting a significance level of 5%. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to define the certainty of the evidence. The primary search retrieved 1827 articles. After removing duplicate records and screening titles and abstracts for eligibility, a total of 21 articles were selected for full-text analysis. Of these, seven eligible studies were included for data extraction and qualitative synthesis, while four studies were selected for quantitative synthesis. All studies had a longitudinal design; three performed a before-after comparison and four were controlled studies. OM was assessed by the following scales: OAG, WHO, ChIMES, and WCCNR. While data analysis of the selected studies was heterogeneous, the implementation of oral health education strategies was found to reduce the incidence and severity of OM during the follow-up period. The meta-analysis showed a favorable outcome for the educational intervention. The likelihood of patients attending oral health education activities to manifest OM ulcerative lesions was significantly lower (P = 0.002) than that of the control. The GRADE analysis presented a low certainty of the evidence. To conclude, oral health education interventions improved OM outcomes in pediatric oncology patients with a low quality of evidence."

We analyzed the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and content validity of six sentiment methods in a sample of 793,725 multidisciplinary clinical notes among 41,283 hospitalizations associated with an intensive care unit stay. None of these approaches improved early prediction of in-hospital mortality using logistic regression models, but did improve both discrimination and calibration when using random forests. Additionally, positive sentiment measured by the CoreNLP (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.002-0.55), Pattern (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.04-0.17), sentimentr (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.63), and Opinion (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.89) methods were inversely associated with death on the concurrent day after adjustment for demographic characteristics and illness severity. Median daily lexical coverage ranged from 5.4% to 20.1%. While sentiment between all methods was positively correlated, their agreement was weak. Sentiment analysis holds promise for clinical applications but will require a novel domain-specific method applicable to clinical text."

The inclusion of unstructured, clinical narratives to the algorithm may decrease the number of patients requiring manual chart review. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of this semi-automated surveillance algorithm augmented with a natural language processing (NLP) component to improve positive predictive value (PPV) and thus workload reduction (WR).
METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study in patients who underwent colorectal surgery from January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2020. NLP was used to detect keyword counts in clinical notes. Several NLP-algorithms were developed with different count input types and classifiers, and added as component to the original semi-automated algorithm. Traditional manual surveillance was compared with the NLP-augmented surveillance algorithms and sensitivity, specificity, PPV and WR were calculated.
RESULTS: From the NLP-augmented models, the decision tree models with discretized counts or binary counts had the best performance (sensitivity 95.1% (95%CI 83.5-99.4%), WR 60.9%) and improved PPV and WR by only 2.6% and 3.6%, respectively, compared to the original algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of an NLP component to the existing algorithm had modest effect on WR (decrease of 1.4-12.5%), at the cost of sensitivity. For future implementation it will be a trade-off between optimal case-finding techniques versus practical considerations such as acceptability and availability of resources."

Therefore, cumulative incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and severe postpartum hemorrhage are commonly monitored within and compared across maternity hospitals or countries for obstetrical safety improvement. These indicators are usually based on hospital discharge data though their accuracy is seldom assessed. We aimed to measure postpartum hemorrhage and severe postpartum hemorrhage using electronic health records and hospital discharge data separately and compare the detection accuracy of these methods to manual chart review, and to examine the temporal trends in cumulative incidence of these potentially avoidable adverse outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed routinely collected data of 7904 singleton deliveries from a large Swiss university hospital for a three year period (2014-2016). We identified postpartum hemorrhage and severe postpartum hemorrhage in electronic health records by text mining discharge letters and operative reports and calculating drop in hemoglobin from laboratory tests. Diagnostic and procedure codes were used to identify cases in hospital discharge data. A sample of 334 charts was reviewed manually to provide a reference-standard and evaluate the accuracy of the other detection methods.
RESULTS: Sensitivities of detection algorithms based on electronic health records and hospital discharge data were 95.2% (95% CI: 92.6% 97.8%) and 38.2% (33.3% to 43.0%), respectively for postpartum hemorrhage, and 87.5% (85.2% to 89.8%) and 36.2% (26.3% to 46.1%) for severe postpartum hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage cumulative incidence based on electronic health records decreased from 15.6% (13.1% to 18.2%) to 8.5% (6.7% to 10.5%) from the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2016, with an average of 12.5% (11.8% to 13.3%). The cumulative incidence of severe postpartum hemorrhage remained at approximately 4% (3.5% to 4.4%). Hospital discharge data-based algorithms provided significantly underestimated incidences.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital discharge data is not accurate enough to assess the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage at hospital or national level. Instead, automated algorithms based on structured and textual data from electronic health records should be considered, as they provide accurate and timely estimates for monitoring and improvement in obstetrical safety. Furthermore, they have the potential to better code for postpartum hemorrhage thus improving hospital reimbursement."

Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse.
METHODS: An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort.
RESULTS: Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation. Our model may provide a comprehensive and automated approach to opioid misuse identification that augments current workflows and overcomes manual screening barriers."

Studies that were published before October 2015 were electronically and manually searched in three databases. We included human studies that reported the amount of NB, RG and ST in the biopsies taken from the grafted sinuses. Based on the applied grafting materials, extracted data were categorized into different groups. Furthermore, extracted data were classified into three groups based on healing time: (i) ≤ 4.5 mo; (ii) 4.5-9 mo; and (iii) ≥ 9-13.5 mo. The search provided 791 titles. Full text analysis was performed for 258 articles resulting in 136 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Autogenous bone (AB) resulted in the highest amount of NB and lowest amount of RG compared to other grafting materials. Based on this meta-analysis, a significant difference was noticed in the amount of NB formation in grafts with a healing time of > 4.5 mo when compared to the grafts with less healing time. However, when comparing biopsies taken at 4.5-9 mo of healing (average = 6.22 mo) to the ones taken at ≥ 9-13.5 mo (average = 10.36 mo), no significant difference was noticed in the amount of NB formation of various grafts except allografts that resulted in a significantly higher percentage of NB at 9.5 mo of healing. Based on histomorphometric analysis, AB results in the highest amount of NB formation in comparison to the other grafting materials. Bone substitute materials (allografts, alloplastic materials and xenografts) seem to be good alternatives to autogenous bone and can be considered as grafting materials to avoid disadvantages related to AB, including morbidity rate, limited availability and high volumetric change. Combining AB with alloplastic materials and xenografts brings no significant advantages regarding NB formation."

Epub 2017 Jun 19.,Pfortmueller CA,J Crit Care,2017,2017/07/27,,,10.1016/j.jcrc.2017.06.019,"INTRODUCTION: The optimal approach to fluid management in critically ill patients is highly debated. Fluid resuscitation using hypertonic saline was used in the past for more than thirty years, but has recently disappeared from clinical practice. Here we provide an overview on the currently available literature on effects of hypertonic saline infusion for fluid resuscitation in the critically ill.
METHODS: Systematic analysis of reports of clinical trials comparing effects of hypertonic saline as resuscitation fluid to other available crystalloid solutions. A literature search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical trials register (CENTRAL) was conducted to identify suitable studies.
RESULTS: The applied search strategy produced 2284 potential publications. After eliminating doubles, 855 titles and abstracts were screened and 40 references retrieved for full text analysis. At total of 25 scientific studies meet the prespecified inclusion criteria for this study.
CONCLUSION: Fluid resuscitation using hypertonic saline results in volume expansion and less total infusion volume. This may be of interest in oedematous patients with intravascular volume depletion. When such strategies are employed, renal effects may differ markedly according to prior intravascular volume status. Hypertonic saline induced changes in serum osmolality and electrolytes return to baseline within a limited period in time. Sparse evidence indicates that resuscitation with hypertonic saline results in less perioperative complications, ICU days and mortality in selected patients. In conclusion, the use of hypertonic saline may have beneficial features in selected critically ill patients when carefully chosen. Further clinical studies assessing relevant clinical outcomes are warranted."

Epub 2017 Jun 30.,Devoto L,Int J Colorectal Dis,2017,2017/07/02,,,10.1007/s00384-017-2848-y,"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of death from neoplastic disease in men and third in women of all ages. Globally, life expectancy is increasing, and consequently, an increasing number of operations are being performed on more elderly patients with the trend set to continue. Elderly patients are more likely to have cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that are associated with increased peri-operative risk. They further tend to present with more locally advanced disease, more likely to obstruct or have disseminated disease. The aim of this review was to investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic colorectal resection in very elderly patients, and whether there are benefits over open surgery for colorectal cancer.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on Medline, Pubmed, Embase and Google Scholar. All comparative studies evaluating patients undergoing laparoscopic versus open surgery for colorectal cancer in the patients population over 85 were included. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and 30-day overall morbidity. Secondary outcomes were operating time, time to oral diet, number of retrieved lymph nodes, blood loss and 5-year survival.
RESULTS: The search provided 1507 citations. Sixty-nine articles were retrieved for full text analysis, and only six retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall mortality for elective laparoscopic resection was 2.92% and morbidity 23%. No single study showed a significant difference between laparoscopic and open surgery for morbidity or mortality, but pooled data analysis demonstrated reduced morbidity in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.032). Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery are more likely to have a shorter hospital stay and a shorter time to oral diet.
CONCLUSION: Elective laparoscopic resection for colorectal cancer in the over 85 age group is feasible and safe and offers similar advantages over open surgery to those demonstrated in patients of younger ages."

However, evidence about the association between post-discharge non-specific pain and rehospitalization remains limited.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) prospective cohort. TRACE-CORE followed patients with acute coronary syndromes for 24 months post-discharge from the index hospitalization, collected patient-reported generic pain (using SF-36) and chest pain (using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire) and rehospitalization events. We assessed the association between generic pain and 30-day rehospitalization using multivariable logistic regression (N = 787). We also examined the associations among patient-reported pain, pain documentation identified by natural language processing (NLP) from electronic health record (EHR) notes, and the outcome.
RESULTS: Patients were 62 years old (SD = 11.4), with 5.1% Black or Hispanic individuals and 29.9% women. Within 30 days post-discharge, 87 (11.1%) patients were re-hospitalized. Patient-reported mild-to-moderate pain, without EHR documentation, was associated with 30-day rehospitalization (odds ratio [OR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-3.62, reference: no pain) after adjusting for baseline characteristics; while patient-reported mild-to-moderate pain with EHR documentation (presumably addressed) was not (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.52-2.90). Severe pain was also associated with 30-day rehospitalization (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.32-7.54), even after further adjusting for chest pain (OR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.06-6.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported post-discharge generic pain was positively associated with 30-day rehospitalization. Future studies should further disentangle the impact of cardiac and non-cardiac pain on rehospitalization and develop strategies to support the timely management of post-discharge pain by healthcare providers."

Due to the complexity of speech-language processing, the neural mechanisms that underpin various symptoms between different types of aphasia are still not fully understood. We used the network-based statistic method to identify distinct subnetwork(s) of connections differentiating the resting-state functional networks of the anomic and Broca groups. We identified one such subnetwork that mainly involved the brain regions in the premotor, primary motor, primary auditory, and primary sensory cortices in both hemispheres. The majority of connections in the subnetwork were weaker in the Broca group than the anomic group. The network properties of the subnetwork were examined through complex network measures, which indicated that the regions in the superior temporal gyrus and auditory cortex bilaterally exhibit intensive interaction, and primary motor, premotor and primary sensory cortices in the left hemisphere play an important role in information flow and overall communication efficiency. These findings underlied articulatory difficulties and reduced repetition performance in Broca aphasia, which are rarely observed in anomic aphasia. This research provides novel findings into the resting-state brain network differences between groups of individuals with anomic and Broca aphasia. We identified a subnetwork of, rather than isolated, connections that statistically differentiate the resting-state brain networks of the two groups, in comparison with standard lesion symptom mapping results that yield isolated connections."

Epub 2024 Jul 8.,Ibrahim R,Curr Atheroscler Rep,2024,2024/07/08,,,10.1007/s11883-024-01222-6,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Evaluation of social influences on cardiovascular care requires a comprehensive analysis encompassing economic, societal, and environmental factors. The increased utilization of electronic health registries provides a foundation for social phenotyping, yet standardization in methodology remains lacking. This review aimed to elucidate the primary approaches to social phenotyping for cardiovascular risk stratification through electronic health registries.
RECENT FINDINGS: Social phenotyping in the context of cardiovascular risk stratification within electronic health registries can be separated into four principal approaches: place-based metrics, questionnaires, ICD Z-coding, and natural language processing. These methodologies vary in their complexity, advantages and limitations, and intended outcomes. Place-based metrics often rely on geospatial data to infer socioeconomic influences, while questionnaires may directly gather individual-level behavioral and social factors. Z-coding, a relatively new approach, can capture data directly related to social determinant of health domains in the clinical context. Natural language processing has been increasingly utilized to extract social influences from unstructured clinical narratives-offering nuanced insights for risk prediction models. Each method plays an important role in our understanding and approach to using social determinants data for improving population cardiovascular health. These four principal approaches to social phenotyping contribute to a more structured approach to social determinant of health research via electronic health registries, with a focus on cardiovascular risk stratification. Social phenotyping related research should prioritize refining predictive models for cardiovascular diseases and advancing health equity by integrating applied implementation science into public health strategies."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We focused on data capture and transformation and data quality maturity model specified in the National Evaluation System for Health Technology Coordinating Center data quality framework. The informatics analysis included 4 elements: the use of UDIs for identifying device exposure data, the use of standardized codes for defining computable phenotypes, the use of natural language processing for capturing unstructured data elements from clinical data systems, and the use of common data models for standardizing data collection and analyses.
RESULTS: We found that, with the UDI implementation at 3 health systems, the target device exposure data could be effectively identified, particularly for brand-specific devices. Computable phenotypes for study outcomes could be defined using codes; however, ablation registries, natural language processing tools, and chart reviews were required for validating data quality of the phenotypes. The common data model implementation status varied across sites. The maturity level of the key informatics technologies was highly aligned with the data quality maturity model.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the informatics approaches can be feasibly used to capture safety and effectiveness outcomes in real-world data for use in medical device studies supporting label extensions."

We present a review on frailty metrics in the literature, validated assessment methods, and simplified screening tools to better predict and optimize patient outcomes. Methods: An online PubMed search was conducted by three authors (T.A., T.G.R.B., M.M.) for overall frailty, frailty assessment, and preoperative risk assessment. Only English publications were included in the analysis. Full-text analysis was then conducted by all three authors to validate the data. Results: An abundance of literature was found on frailty. Even though some methods are validated as extremely effective for assessing frailty, they may be time-consuming and require a specialist. Various quick screening methods are also presented, many already validated, and should be utilized by urologists more regularly. Conclusions: Multiple studies demonstrate the relationship between frailty and surgical patients' outcome. Many quick, office-based, validated tools to screen for frailty are described, and should be incorporated into our practice in appropriate patients. Future research is now focused on the concept of ""prehabilitation"" to improve patient frailty status in the preoperative setting, and consequently operative outcomes."

Many studies have investigated the use of social media to detect early signals of adverse drug reactions. However, the trustworthiness of signals derived from social media is questionable. To confirm this, a confirmatory study with a positive control (eg, new black box warnings, labeling changes, or withdrawals) is required.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the use of social media in detecting new black box warnings, labeling changes, or withdrawals in advance.
METHODS: This scoping review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A researcher searched PubMed and EMBASE in January 2021. Original studies analyzing black box warnings, labeling changes, or withdrawals from social media were selected, and the results of the studies were summarized.
RESULTS: A total of 14 studies were included in this scoping review. Most studies (8/14, 57.1%%) collected data from a single source, and 10 (71.4%) used specialized health care social networks and forums. The analytical methods used in these studies varied considerably. Three studies (21.4%) manually annotated posts, while 5 (35.7%) adopted machine learning algorithms. Nine studies (64.2%) concluded that social media could detect signals 3 months to 9 years before action from regulatory authorities. Most of these studies (8/9, 88.9%) were conducted on specialized health care social networks and forums. On the contrary, 5 (35.7%) studies yielded modest or negative results. Of these, 2 (40%) used generic social networking sites, 2 (40%) used specialized health care networks and forums, and 1 (20%) used both generic social networking sites and specialized health care social networks and forums. The most recently published study recommends not using social media for pharmacovigilance. Several challenges remain in using social media for pharmacovigilance regarding coverage, data quality, and analytic processing.
CONCLUSIONS: Social media, along with conventional pharmacovigilance measures, can be used to detect signals associated with new black box warnings, labeling changes, or withdrawals. Several challenges remain; however, social media will be useful for signal detection of frequently mentioned drugs in specialized health care social networks and forums. Further studies are required to advance natural language processing and mine real-world data on social media."

Epub 2022 Oct 12.,Amin D,J Oral Maxillofac Surg,2023,2022/11/09,,,10.1016/j.joms.2022.10.002,"PURPOSE: The frequency of intimate partner violence (IPV) is much lower in males than females. Data regarding IPV-related injuries patterns and characteristics in males are scant. The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare patterns of IPV-related head and neck injuries between men and women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study reviewed cases of IPV at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia from January 2016 to August 2019. The study sample was collected from electronic medical records by identifying IPV subjects using a natural language processing algorithm and then cross-referencing the trauma registry to identify patients who sustained head and neck injuries. The primary analyses of interest were to measure the association between gender and the following covariates: age, race, insurance status, setting of injury, day of injury, social history, report of physical abuse, mechanism of injury, injury location, brain injuries, soft tissue injuries, facial fractures, other associated injuries, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, and discharge status. Univariate and bivariate analyses were calculated. Statistical significance was P < .05.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty six patients met inclusion criteria. There were 120 (76.9%) female patients with a mean age of 34.5 years (range, 16 to 67 years). There were 36 (23%) male patients with a mean age of 43.8 years (range, 18 to 77 years). Women were statistically more likely than men to have government-subsidized insurance (47 [39.2%] vs 7 [19.4%]; P = .03), positive alcohol exposure (27 [22.5%] vs 19 [52.8%]; P = .0001), positive illicit drugs toxicology screen (25 [20.8%] vs 13 [36.1%]; P < .02), report physical abuse (24 [20%] vs 0; P = .004), have subarachnoid hemorrhage (14 [11.7%] vs 0; P = .04), and/or lower extremity injuries (39 [32.5%] vs 5 [13.9%]; P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Males tend not to report physical abuse; this behavior contributes to IPV under-reporting in males."

Using medical record review to identify conditions within large quantities of EMRs can be time-consuming and inefficient. EMR-based phenotyping using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms is a continually developing area of study that holds potential for numerous mental health disorders.
OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates the current state of EMR-based case identification for depression and provides guidance on using current algorithms and constructing new ones.
METHODS: A scoping review of EMR-based algorithms for phenotyping depression was completed. This research encompassed studies published from January 2000 to May 2023. The search involved 3 databases: Embase, MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo. This was carried out using selected keywords that fell into 3 categories: terms connected with EMRs, terms connected to case identification, and terms pertaining to depression. This study adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 20 papers were assessed and summarized in the review. Most of these studies were undertaken in the United States, accounting for 75% (15/20). The United Kingdom and Spain followed this, accounting for 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20) of the studies, respectively. Both data-driven and clinical rule-based methodologies were identified. The development of EMR-based phenotypes and algorithms indicates the data accessibility permitted by each health system, which led to varying performance levels among different algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: Better use of structured and unstructured EMR components through techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing has the potential to improve depression phenotyping. However, more validation must be carried out to have confidence in depression case identification algorithms in general."

A critical review,"Doornewaard R, Jacquet W, Cosyn J, De Bruyn H.",Clin Oral Implants Res. 2018 Oct;29 Suppl 18(Suppl Suppl 18):100-123. doi: 10.1111/clr.13264.,Doornewaard R,Clin Oral Implants Res,2018,2018/10/12,PMC6220966,,10.1111/clr.13264,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this critical review was to evaluate whether commonly used biologic diagnostic parameters correspond to implant survival and peri-implantitis prevalence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publications from 2011 to 2017 were selected by an electronic search using the Pubmed database of the US National Library of Medicine. Prospective and retrospective studies with a mean follow-up time of at least 5 years and reporting prevalence of peri-implantitis as well as mean bone loss and standard deviation were selected. The correlation between reported prevalence of peri-implantitis and reported implant survival, mean follow-up time, mean bone loss, mean probing depth, and mean bleeding on probing was calculated. Mean bone loss and standard deviation were used for estimation of proportion of implants with bone loss exceeding 1, 2, and 3 mm.
RESULTS: Full-text analysis was performed for 255 papers from 4,173 available ones, and 41 met all the inclusion criteria. The overall mean weighted survival rate was 96.9% (89.9%-100%) and the reported prevalence of peri-implantitis ranged between 0% and 39.7%, based on 15 different case definitions. The overall weighted bone loss was 1.1 mm based on 8,182 implants and an average mean loading time ranging from 5 to 20 years. No correlation was found between mean bone loss and the reported prevalence of peri-implantitis. The estimated prevalence of implants with bone loss above 2 mm was 23%. The overall weighted mean probing depth was 3.3 mm, and mean weighted bleeding was 52.2%. Only a weak correlation was found between survival and function time (r = -0.49). There was no relation between the probing depth or bleeding and the mean bone loss, mean follow-up time, and reported prevalence of peri-implantitis.
CONCLUSION: Biologic parameters mean probing depth and mean bleeding on probing do not correlate with mean bone loss and this irrespective of follow-up. Case definition for peri-implantitis varied significantly between studies indicating that an unambiguous definition based on a specified threshold for bone loss is not agreed upon in the literature."

We conducted a large-scale, natural language processing (NLP) analysis of conversations on opioid-related drug forums to better understand concerns among people who use opioids.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed posts from 14 opioid-related forums on the social network Reddit. We applied NLP to identify frequently mentioned substances and phrases, and grouped the phrases manually based on their contents into three broad key themes: (i) prescription and/or illegal opioid use; (ii) substance use disorder treatment access and care; and (iii) withdrawal. Phrases that were unmappable to any particular theme were discarded. We computed the frequencies of substance and theme mentions, and quantified their volumes over time. We compared changes in post volumes by key themes and substances between pre-COVID-19 (1/1/2019-2/29/2020) and COVID-19 (3/1/2020-11/30/2020) periods.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven thousand six hundred fifty-two and 119,168 posts were collected for the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. By theme, posts about treatment and access to care increased by 300%, from 0.631 to 2.526 per 1000 posts between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Conversations about withdrawal increased by 812% between the same periods (0.026 to 0.235 per 1,000 posts). Posts about drug use did not increase (0.219 to 0.218 per 1,000 posts). By substance, among medications for opioid use disorder, methadone had the largest increase in conversations (20.751 to 56.313 per 1,000 posts; 171.4% increase). Among other medications, posts about diphenhydramine exhibited the largest increase (0.341 to 0.927 per 1,000 posts; 171.8% increase).
CONCLUSIONS: Conversations on opioid-related forums among people who use opioids revealed increased concerns about treatment and access to care along with withdrawal following the emergence of COVID-19. Greater attention to social media data may help inform timely responses to the needs of people who use opioids during COVID-19."

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented ""infodemic""; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis-related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19-related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data.
METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources.
RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world's largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19-related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators' critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19-related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA's design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers' critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world's largest COVID-19-related data corpora for searches and curation."

Performing research studies into identifying the causes and treatment for this disease has great potential to provide benefit for these individuals. However, AD clinical trial recruitment is a non-trivial task due to variance in diagnostic precision and phenotypic definitions leveraged by different clinicians as well as time spent finding, recruiting, and enrolling patients by clinicians to become study subjects. Thus, there is a need for automatic and effective patient phenotyping for cohort recruitment.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to present an approach for identifying patients whose electronic health records suggest that they may have AD.
METHODS: We created a vectorized representation of each patient and trained various supervised machine learning methods to classify when a patient has AD. Each patient is represented by a vector of either probabilities or binary values where each value indicates whether they meet a different criteria for AD diagnosis.
RESULTS: The most accurate AD classifier performed with a class-balanced accuracy of 0.8036, a precision of 0.8400, and a recall of 0.7500 when using XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).
CONCLUSIONS: Creating an automated approach for identifying patient cohorts has the potential to accelerate, standardize, and automate the process of patient recruitment for AD studies; therefore, reducing clinician burden and informing knowledge discovery of better treatment options for AD."

Apart from amputations, data on factors contributing to this problem are generally absent.
METHODS: Narrative text analysis was performed on workers' compensation claims in order to identify machine-related injuries and determine work tasks involved. Data were further evaluated on the basis of cost per claim, nature of injury, and part of body.
RESULTS: From an initial set of 4,268 claims, 1,053 were classified as machine-related. Frequently identified tasks included machine operation (31%), workpiece handling (20%), setup/adjustment (15%), and removing chips (12%). Lacerations to finger(s), hand, or thumb comprised 38% of machine-related injuries; foreign body in the eye accounted for 20%. Amputations were relatively rare but had highest costs per claim (mean $21,059; median $11,998).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite limitations, workers' compensation data were useful in characterizing machine-related injuries. Improving the quality of data collected by insurers would enhance occupational injury surveillance and prevention efforts. Am. J. Ind. Med. 59:656-664, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

METHODS: The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) application was used to identify patients with a first diagnosis of dementia. Medication exposure was extracted through a natural language processing algorithm, allowing for calculations and comparisons of AEC scores. Data were linked to national mortality and hospitalisation data sources, and serially recorded Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were used to investigate cognitive decline.
RESULTS: We identified 14 093 patients with dementia, 60.7% were female and the mean age at diagnosis was 79.8 years. Patients for whom a review of their medication was indicated (AEC score ≥ 2 for any individual drug or total AEC score ≥ 3) had an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.15) and emergency hospitalisation (1.10; 95% CI: 1.04-1.17), but there were no associations with duration of hospitalisation. Cognitive trajectory analyses showed that this exposure group had lower MMSE scores at diagnosis and a sharper increase in MMSE scores over the subsequent 6 months, but similar slopes for the 6 to 36 months period compared to the remainder of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dementia receiving medication with high central anticholinergic activity appear to have worse prognosis in terms of mortality and hospitalisation risk, but have, primarily, acutely impaired cognitive function, rather than longer-term differences in cognitive decline.

Sexual minority individuals may have an increased risk for suicide compared with heterosexual individuals, but a lack of sufficiently powered studies with rigorous methods for determining sexual orientation has limited the knowledge on this potential health disparity.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate suicide mortality among sexual minority veterans using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health record data.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective population-based cohort study used data on 8.1 million US veterans enrolled in the VHA after fiscal year 1999 that were obtained from VHA electronic health records from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2017. Data analysis was carried out from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020.
EXPOSURE: Veterans with documentation of a minority sexual orientation. Documentation of sexual minority status was obtained through natural language processing of clinical notes and extraction of structured administrative data for sexual orientation in VHA electronic health records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Suicide mortality rate using data on the underlying cause of death obtained from the National Death Index. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for all-cause death and death from suicide among sexual minority veterans compared with the general US population and the general population of veterans.
RESULTS: Among the 96 893 veterans with at least 1 sexual minority documentation in the electronic health record, the mean (SD) age was 46 (16) years, 68% were male, and 70% were White. Of the 12 591 total deaths, 3.5% were from suicide. Veterans had a significantly higher rate of mortality from suicide (standardized mortality ratio, 4.50; 95% CI, 4.13-4.99) compared with the general US population. Suicide was the fifth leading cause of death in 2017 among sexual minority veterans (3.8% of deaths) and the tenth leading cause of death in the general US population (1.7% of deaths). The crude suicide rate among sexual minority veterans (82.5 per 100 000 person-years) was higher than the rate in the general veteran population (37.7 per 100 000 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that sexual minority veterans have a greater risk for suicide than the general US population and the general veteran population. Further research is needed to determine whether and how suicide prevention efforts reach sexual minority veterans."

It is vital to stratify patients early based on their severity, since undertriage can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. Our aim was to present a new approach to assist healthcare professionals at triage in the stratification of patients and in identifying those with higher risk of ICU admission. Adult patients assigned Manchester Triage System (MTS) or Emergency Severity Index (ESI) 1 to 3 from a Portuguese and a United States Emergency Departments were analyzed. Variables routinely collected at triage were used and natural language processing was applied to the patient chief complaint. Stratified random sampling was applied to split the data in train (70%) and test (30%) sets and 10-fold cross validation was performed for model training. Logistic regression, random forests, and a random undersampling boosting algorithm were used. We compared the performance obtained with the reference model-using only triage priorities-with the models using additional variables. For both hospitals, a logistic regression model achieved higher overall performance, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.92) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.27-0.33) for the United States hospital and of 0.85 (95% CI 0.83-0.86) and 0.06 (95% CI 0.05-0.07) for the Portuguese hospital. Heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure were the most important predictors of ICU admission. Compared to the reference models, the models using clinical variables and the chief complaint presented higher recall for patients assigned MTS/ESI 3 and can identify patients assigned MTS/ESI 3 who are at risk for ICU admission."

While manual extraction is cost efficient for small studies, larger studies such as systematic reviews are much more costly and time-consuming. To avoid exhaustive manual searches and extraction, and their related cost and effort, natural language processing (NLP) methods can be tailored for the more subtle extraction and decision tasks that typically only humans have performed. The need for such studies that use the published literature as a data source became even more evident as the COVID-19 pandemic raged through the world and millions of sequenced samples were deposited in public repositories such as GISAID and GenBank, promising large genomic epidemiology studies, but more often than not lacked many important details that prevented large-scale studies. Thus, granular geographic location or the most basic patient-relevant data such as demographic information, or clinical outcomes were not noted in the sequence record. However, some of these data was indeed published, but in the text, tables, or supplementary material of a corresponding published article. We present here methods to identify relevant journal articles that report having produced and made available in GenBank or GISAID, new SARS-CoV-2 sequences, as those that initially produced and made available the sequences are the most likely articles to include the high-level details about the patients from whom the sequences were obtained. Human annotators validated the approach, creating a gold standard set for training and validation of a machine learning classifier. Identifying these articles is a crucial step to enable future automated informatics pipelines that will apply Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to identify patient characteristics such as co-morbidities, outcomes, age, gender, and race, enriching SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases with actionable information for defining large genomic epidemiology studies. Thus, enriched patient metadata can enable secondary data analysis, at scale, to uncover associations between the viral genome (including variants of concern and their sublineages), transmission risk, and health outcomes. However, for such enrichment to happen, the right papers need to be found and very detailed data needs to be extracted from them. Further, finding the very specific articles needed for inclusion is a task that also facilitates scoping and systematic reviews, greatly reducing the time needed for full-text analysis and extraction."

Epub 2024 Aug 8.,Ye X,J Epidemiol Glob Health,2024,2024/08/08,PMC11442711,,10.1007/s44197-024-00284-8,"BACKGROUND: The global research on pandemics or epidemics and mental health has been growing exponentially recently, which cannot be integrated through traditional systematic review. Our study aims to systematically synthesize the evidence using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
METHODS: Multiple databases were searched using titles, abstracts, and keywords. We systematically identified relevant literature published prior to Dec 31, 2023, using NLP techniques such as text classification, topic modelling and geoparsing methods. Relevant articles were categorized by content, date, and geographic location, outputting evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in related publications.
RESULTS: Our NLP analysis identified 77,915 studies in the area of pandemics or epidemics and mental health published before Dec 31, 2023. The Covid pandemic was the most common, followed by SARS and HIV/AIDS; Anxiety and stress were the most frequently studied mental health outcomes; Social support and healthcare were the most common way of coping. Geographically, the evidence base was dominated by studies from high-income countries, with scant evidence from low-income counties. Co-occurrence of pandemics or epidemics and fear, depression, stress was common. Anxiety was one of the three most common topics in all continents except North America.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the importance and feasibility of using NLP to comprehensively map pandemics or epidemics and mental health in the age of big literature. The review identifies clear themes for future clinical and public health research, and is critical for designing evidence-based approaches to reduce the negative mental health impacts of pandemics or epidemics."

However, due to the difficulty of finding SIRVA cases in large health care databases, population-based studies are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to develop a natural language processing (NLP) method to identify SIRVA cases from clinical notes.
METHODS: We conducted the study among members of a large integrated health care organization who were vaccinated between April 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, and had subsequent diagnosis codes indicative of shoulder injury. Based on a training data set with a chart review reference standard of 164 cases, we developed an NLP algorithm to extract shoulder disorder information, including prior vaccination, anatomic location, temporality and causality. The algorithm identified 3 groups of positive SIRVA cases (definite, probable, and possible) based on the strength of evidence. We compared NLP results to a chart review reference standard of 100 vaccinated cases. We then applied the final automated NLP algorithm to a broader cohort of vaccinated persons with a shoulder injury diagnosis code and performed manual chart confirmation on a random sample of NLP-identified definite cases and all NLP-identified probable and possible cases.
RESULTS: In the validation sample, the NLP algorithm had 100% accuracy for identifying 4 SIRVA cases and 96 cases without SIRVA. In the broader cohort of 53,585 vaccinations, the NLP algorithm identified 291 definite, 124 probable, and 52 possible SIRVA cases. The chart-confirmation rates for these groups were 95.5% (278/291), 67.7% (84/124), and 17.3% (9/52), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm performed with high sensitivity and reasonable specificity in identifying positive SIRVA cases. The NLP algorithm can potentially be used in future population-based studies to identify this rare adverse event, avoiding labor-intensive chart review validation."

This review assessed global trends in scientific publications on MDT in the elderly. Six databases were searched. Studies about MDT in the elderly (≥60 years old) were included in two text mining stages (S1 and S2). In S1, all studies with elderly subjects were included, while in S2 only studies in which the elderly were assessed in a separate set of data or in a subanalysis by age groups were included. In S1, relevant data were mined using VantagePoint™ software. In S2, data were descriptively analyzed. There were 2265 studies at S1 and 110 at S2. The publication dates spanned from 1963 to 2023. In S1, the most cited keywords and terms were aged (n = 1872), male (n = 1839), female (n = 1777), ""mandible fracture"" (n = 460), ""orbit fracture"" (n = 362), and ""maxilla fracture"" (n = 118). Thirty authors published 10 or more articles with visible collaboration networks. There was a progressive increase in publications, especially in Europe (n = 150). In S2, most studies were case reports/case series (n = 62). The primary etiology was accidental falls (n = 84), the most affected region was the middle third of the face (n = 65), and dental trauma was rarely reported (n = 15). Cone Beam computed tomography was the most used diagnostic tool (n = 67). Of the 81 articles that addressed therapy, 52 opted for surgical treatment. Although there has been an increase in the number of articles on MDT over the years, studies with the elderly population as a specific study group are still needed. Accidental falls were the most reported etiology, while the middle third of the face and the mandible were the anatomic region and bone most affected, respectively. The high number of case reports indicates the need for improvement in the available scientific evidence about MDT in the elderly."

The saturation of the sanitary system and confinement measures have multiplied the waste generated, which implies the need to adapt environmental policies to this new situation caused by the pandemic. It is a review article whose objective was to identify the environmental policies that would facilitate an adequate treatment of the waste generated by the pandemic. It was proposed to analyse the current lines of research developed on this paradigm, applying the text mining methodology. A systematic review of 111 studies published in environmental journals indexed in the Web of Science was carried out. The results identified three areas of interest: knowledge of transmission routes, management of the massive generation of plastics and appropriate treatment of solid waste in extreme situations. Leaders are called upon to implement the contingency plans to sustainably alleviate the enormous waste burden caused by society's adaptation to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Specifically, innovation aimed at achieving the reuse of medical products, the promotion of the circular economy and educational campaigns to promote clean environments should be encouraged."

Progress in the control of tuberculosis has been undermined by the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. The aim of the study is to reveal the trends of research on medications for multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB) through a novel method of bibliometrics that co-occurs specific semantic Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).
METHODS: PubMed was used to identify the original publications related to medications for MDR-PTB. An R package for text mining of PubMed, pubMR, was adopted to extract data and construct the co-occurrence matrix-specific semantic types. Biclustering analysis of high-frequency MeSH term co-occurrence matrix was performed by gCLUTO. Scientific knowledge maps were constructed by VOSviewer to create overlay visualization and density visualization. Burst detection was performed by CiteSpace to identify the future research hotspots.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eight substances (chemical, drug, protein) and 147 diseases related to MDR-PTB were extracted to form a specific semantic co-occurrence matrix. MeSH terms with frequency greater than or equal to six were selected to construct high-frequency co-occurrence matrix (42 × 20) of specific semantic types contains 42 substances and 20 diseases. Biclustering analysis divided the medications for MDR-PTB into five clusters and reflected the characteristics of drug composition. The overlay map indicated the average age gradients of 42 high-frequency drugs. Fifteen top keywords and 37 top terms with the strongest citation bursts were detected.
CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the literatures related to MDR-PTB drug therapy, providing a co-occurrence matrix model based on the specific semantic types and a new attempt for text knowledge mining. Compared with the macro knowledge structure or hot spot analysis, this method may have a wider scope of application and a more in-depth degree of analysis."

Adaptive pain-coping strategies can enhance this improvement, but maladaptive approaches such as pain catastrophizing may worsen overall patient well-being. This narrative review aims to provide a concise overview of the existing knowledge on pain catastrophizing in the most prevalent specific rheumatic disorders. The objective of this study was to improve understanding of this phenomenon and its implications, as well as to pinpoint potential directions for future research. We conducted searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS, and DOAJ bibliography databases to identify articles related to pain catastrophizing in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylarthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and osteoarthritis (non-surgical treatment). Data extraction was performed on November 1, 2023. The investigators screened the identified articles to determine their relevance and whether they met the inclusion criteria. Following a bibliography search, which was further expanded by screening of citations and references, we included 156 records in the current review. The full-text analysis centred on pain catastrophizing, encompassing its prevalence, pathogenesis, and impact. The review established the role of catastrophizing in amplifying pain and diminishing various aspects of general well-being. Also, potential treatment approaches were discussed and summarised across the examined disorders. Pain catastrophizing is as a significant factor in rheumatic disorders. Its impact warrants further exploration through prospective controlled trials to enhance global patient outcomes."

STUDY SETTING: A multihospital academic health system in southeastern Massachusetts.
STUDY DESIGN: An observational study of 49,319 patients with cardiovascular disease admitted from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, using multivariable logistic regression to adjust for patient characteristics.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: All-payer claims, EHR data, and physician notes extracted from a centralized clinical registry.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All seven social characteristics were identified at the highest rates in physician notes. For example, we identified 14,872 patient admissions with poor social support in physician notes, increasing the prevalence from 0.4 percent using ICD-9 codes and structured EHR data to 16.0 percent. Compared to an 18.6 percent baseline readmission rate, risk-adjusted analysis showed higher readmission risk for patients with housing instability (readmission rate 24.5 percent; p < .001), depression (20.6 percent; p < .001), drug abuse (20.2 percent; p = .01), and poor social support (20.0 percent; p = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The seven social risk factors studied are substantially more prevalent than represented in administrative data. Automated methods for analyzing physician notes may enable better identification of patients with social needs."

However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion.
RESULTS: There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction. Of those, only 45% specifically identified the pharmacy data source, and 55% specified drug agents or drug classes. Multiple AI methods were used; 25% used machine learning (ML), 67% used natural language processing (NLP), and 8% combined ML and NLP.
CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that the application of AI data methods for pharmacy informatics and cancer epidemiology research is expanding. However, the data sources and representations are often missing, challenging study replicability. In addition, there is no consistent format for reporting results, and one of the preferred metrics, F-score, is often missing. There is a resultant need for greater transparency of original data sources and performance of AI methods with pharmacy data to improve the translation of these results into meaningful outcomes."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was conducted to study the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease among patients diagnosed with various autoimmune diseases compared to the general population. Data from electronic medical records from the Castilla-La Mancha healthcare system were analyzed using Natural Language Processing through the Savana Manager® artificial intelligence clinical platform. A total of 1,028,356 patients were analyzed, including 28,920 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 999,436 control patients.
RESULTS: Out of the 12 autoimmune diseases analyzed, 5 showed a significant association with Alzheimer's disease with p < 0.05. Myasthenia gravis had an increased prevalence of AD with OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.11-2), systemic lupus erythematosus with OR 2.42 (95% CI 2.02-2.88), rheumatoid arthritis with OR 1.38 (95% CI 1.24-1.54), polymyalgia rheumatica with OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.08-2.23), and pernicious anemia with OR 2.06 (95% CI 1.59-2.66). The remaining autoimmune diseases analyzed did not show a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease compared to the general population.
CONCLUSIONS: There may be an association between certain systemic autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, establish causality, and explore the underlying mechanisms of this association."

The traditional methods that are used for public health surveillance, however, involve many drawbacks, such as being labor intensive to operate and resulting in a lag between data collection and reporting. To effectively address the limitations of these traditional methods and to mitigate the adverse effects of these diseases, a proactive and real-time public health surveillance system is needed. Previous studies have indicated the usefulness of performing text mining on social media.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature that used textual content published to social media for the purpose of the surveillance and prediction of communicable diseases.
METHODOLOGY: Broad search queries were formulated and performed in four databases. Both journal articles and conference materials were included. The quality of the studies, operationalized as reliability and validity, was assessed. This qualitative systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
RESULTS: Twenty-three publications were included in this systematic review. All studies reported positive results for using textual social media content to surveille communicable diseases. Most studies used Twitter as a source for these data. Influenza was studied most frequently, while other communicable diseases received far less attention. Journal articles had a higher quality (reliability and validity) than conference papers. However, studies often failed to provide important information about procedures and implementation.
CONCLUSION: Text mining of health-related content published on social media can serve as a novel and powerful tool for the automated, real-time, and remote monitoring of public health and for the surveillance and prediction of communicable diseases in particular. This tool can address limitations related to traditional surveillance methods, and it has the potential to supplement traditional methods for public health surveillance."

Larger high quality studies have predominantly focussed on optimal anticoagulation however CRRT is complex and filter life is also affected by vascular access, circuit and management factors. We performed a systematic search of the literature to identify and quantify the effect of vascular access, circuit and patient factors that affect filter life and presented the results as a meta-analysis.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching Pubmed (MEDLINE) and Ovid EMBASE libraries from inception to 29th February 2016 for all studies with a comparator or independent variable relating to CRRT circuits and reporting filter life. Included studies documented filter life in hours with a comparator other than anti-coagulation intervention. All studies comparing anticoagulation interventions were searched for regression or hazard models pertaining to other sources of variation in filter life.
RESULTS: Eight hundred nineteen abstracts were identified of which 364 were selected for full text analysis. 24 presented data on patient modifiers of circuit life, 14 on vascular access modifiers and 34 on circuit related factors. Risk of bias was high and findings are hypothesis generating. Ranking of vascular access site by filter longevity favours: tunnelled semi-permanent catheters, femoral, internal jugular and subclavian last. There is inconsistency in the difference reported between femoral and jugular catheters. Amongst published literature, modality of CRRT consistently favoured continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHD-F) with an associated 44% lower failure rate compared to CVVH. There was a trend favouring higher blood flow rates. There is insufficient data to determine advantages of haemofilter membranes. Patient factors associated with a statistically significant worsening of filter life included mechanical ventilation, elevated SOFA or LOD score, elevations in ionized calcium, elevated platelet count, red cell transfusion, platelet factor 4 (PF-4) antibodies, and elevated fibrinogen. Majority of studies are observational or report circuit factors in sub-analysis. Risk of bias is high and findings require targeted investigations to confirm.
CONCLUSION: The interaction of patient, pathology, anticoagulation, vascular access, circuit and staff factors contribute to CRRT filter life. There remains an ambiguity from published data as to which site and side should be the first choice for vascular access placement and what interaction this has with patient factors and timing. Early consideration of tunnelled semi-permanent access may provide optimal filter life if longer periods of CRRT are anticipated. There remains an absence of robust evidence outside of anti-coagulation strategies despite over 20 years of therapy delivery however trends favour CVVHD-F over CVVH."

We aimed to describe bleeding small intestine varices (SIV) in patients with cirrhosis and compare characteristics and outcomes to published case reports.
METHODS: We performed an institutional chart review using billing codes and natural language processing between 2008 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with cirrhosis and SIV verified by endoscopy, video capsule, or imaging. Patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension and stomal varices were excluded. We examined demographic and clinical factors, characteristics of SIV, bleeding, intervention, and outcomes in our series and collated data from published cases identified during a literature review.
RESULTS: We identified 71 patients with cirrhosis and SIV (18 bled). The literature search yielded 76 cases with bleeding SIV. Our series and published cases were matched for age, sex, liver disease etiology, and SIV location. Length of stay and transfusion requirements were similar. Aggregate initial treatments (number, hemostasis rate) included medical (n = 7, 57%), endoscopic (n = 48, 56%), interventional radiology (n = 31, 77%), and surgery (n = 8, 87%). Hospital and overall mortality rates were higher in our series (22% and 38%) compared with the published cases (5.3% and 18.4%), respectively (P = 0.02 and P = 0.07).
DISCUSSION: A quarter of patients with cirrhosis and SIV experience bleeding, with high transfusion requirements, frequent need for secondary interventions, and high mortality. These findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach and second-line therapeutic modalities in the timely management of bleeding SIV in cirrhosis."

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were considered: MI, ischemic stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, and hospitalization due to unstable angina. The association between MACE rates and the variables included in this study was evaluated following univariate and multivariate approaches.
RESULTS: Most patients were male (72.13%), with a mean age of 70.5±10 years. Regarding T2D, most patients were non-insulin-dependent T2D (61.75%) with high prevalence of comorbidities. The median (Q1-Q3) duration of follow-up was 1.2 (0.3-4.5) years. Overall, 35.66% of patients suffered from at least one MACE during follow up. Using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model analysis, several independent factors were associated with MACE during follow up: CAD duration (p < 0.001), COPD/Asthma (p = 0.021), heart valve disease (p = 0.031), multivessel disease (p = 0.005), insulin treatment (p < 0.001), statins treatment (p < 0.001), and clopidogrel treatment (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed high rates of MACE in a large real-world series of PCI-revascularized patients with T2D and CAD with no history of MI or stroke. These data represent a potential opportunity to improve the clinical management of these patients."

Epub 2021 Jul 19.,Go AS,Chest,2021,2021/07/22,PMC8288227,,10.1016/j.chest.2021.07.025,"BACKGROUND: Limited existing data suggest that the novel COVID-19 may increase risk of VTE, but information from large, ethnically diverse populations with appropriate control participants is lacking.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the rate of VTE among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 differ from matched hospitalized control participants without COVID-19?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among hospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized adults without evidence of COVID-19 matched for age, sex, race or ethnicity, acute illness severity, and month of hospitalization between January 2020 and August 2020 from two integrated health care delivery systems with 36 hospitals. Outcomes included VTE (DVT or pulmonary embolism ascertained using diagnosis codes combined with validated natural language processing algorithms applied to electronic health records) and death resulting from any cause at 30 days. Fine and Gray hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association of COVID-19 with VTE after accounting for competing risk of death and residual differences between groups, as well as to identify predictors of VTE in patients with COVID-19.
RESULTS: We identified 6,319 adults with COVID-19 and 6,319 matched adults without COVID-19, with mean ± SD age of 60.0 ± 17.2 years, 46% women, 53.1% Hispanic, 14.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 10.3% Black. During 30-day follow-up, 313 validated cases of VTE (160 COVID-19, 153 control participants) and 1,172 deaths (817 in patients with COVID-19, 355 in control participants) occurred. Adults with COVID-19 showed a more than threefold adjusted risk of VTE (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.48; 95% CI, 2.03-5.98) compared with matched control participants. Predictors of VTE in patients with COVID-19 included age ≥ 55 years, Black race, prior VTE, diagnosed sepsis, prior moderate or severe liver disease, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2, and platelet count &gt; 217 k/μL.
INTERPRETATION: Among ethnically diverse hospitalized adults, COVID-19 infection increased the risk of VTE, and selected patient characteristics were associated with higher thromboembolic risk in the setting of COVID-19."

Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of research that uses conversational agents.
OBJECTIVE: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA, describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify areas for further development.
METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies were independently screened, and their methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent synthesis and narrative summary.
RESULTS: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8% (20) of which met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition, technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions. However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based on evidence-informed theories and treatment approaches and should address users' desires for program variety, natural language processing, delivery via mobile devices, and safety and privacy concerns."

The aim of the current study was to apply text mining and topic modelling analysis on scientific literature regarding suicide, burnout, and depression among veterinary practitioners and students to extract meaningful and synthetic information. These statistical approaches can be used to comprehend more in deep the phenomena involving veterinarians and veterinary students and to suggest the potential changes needed in admission to veterinary school, veterinary curricula, and post-graduation initiatives as preventive actions.
RESULTS: A systematic search protocol was set up to identify scientific literature that published on the topic from 1985 to 2019. Two-hundred-eleven records were selected with abstracts/texts submitted to text mining and topic modelling analysis. Student, stress, work, anim*, and euthanasia resulted the most frequent terms. Topics modelling allowed to differentiate groups of words and papers in 3 areas of interest: 1) students' difficulties encountered during their studies that increase stress and anxiety impairing their psychological health; 2) exposure to death and euthanasia as risk factor for mental health; and 3) need of support among those providing medical and health care, and of supportive group work to cope with such profession.
CONCLUSION: Based on the most frequent words included in the clouds and on the contents of the papers clusterised in them, some suggestions are interfered. It is emphasized that the veterinary curricula should include courses that prepare them early to deal with animal death and post-death grief of pet owners, to handle ethical dilemmas and moral stressors, to communicate with clients and staff members, to work in team, to balance work-family life and to promote individual and team resources. Specific courses for veterinary practitioners could keep them updated on their new roles and ways to handle them among functioning as potential feedbacks to monitor their psychological wellbeing."

Although this event stirred a worldwide debate on ethical and legal issues regarding clinical trials with embryonic gene sequences, the focus has mainly been on academics and professionals. However, how the public, especially stratified by geographic region and culture, reacted to these issues is not yet well-understood.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine web-based posts about the #GeneEditedBabies event and characterize and compare the public's stance across social media platforms with different user bases.
METHODS: We used a set of relevant keywords to search for web-based posts in 4 worldwide or regional mainstream social media platforms: Sina Weibo (China), Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. We applied structural topic modeling to analyze the main discussed topics and their temporal trends. On the basis of the topics we found, we designed an annotation codebook to label 2000 randomly sampled posts from each platform on whether a supporting, opposing, or neutral stance toward this event was expressed and what the major considerations of those posts were if a stance was described. The annotated data were used to compare stances and the language used across the 4 web-based platforms.
RESULTS: We collected >220,000 posts published by approximately 130,000 users regarding the #GeneEditedBabies event. Our results indicated that users discussed a wide range of topics, some of which had clear temporal trends. Our results further showed that although almost all experts opposed this event, many web-based posts supported this event. In particular, Twitter exhibited the largest number of posts in opposition (701/816, 85.9%), followed by Sina Weibo (968/1140, 84.91%), Reddit (550/898, 61.2%), and YouTube (567/1078, 52.6%). The primary opposing reason was rooted in ethical concerns, whereas the primary supporting reason was based on the expectation that such technology could prevent the occurrence of diseases in the future. Posts from these 4 platforms had different language uses and patterns when they expressed stances on the #GeneEditedBabies event.
CONCLUSIONS: This research provides evidence that posts on web-based platforms can offer insights into the public's stance on gene editing techniques. However, these stances vary across web-based platforms and often differ from those raised by academics and policy makers."

Epub 2024 Feb 21.,Oh WO,J Nurs Scholarsh,2024,2024/02/21,,,10.1111/jnu.12963,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of novel infectious diseases has amplified the urgent need for effective prevention strategies, especially ones targeting vulnerable populations such as children. Factors such as the high incidence of both emerging and existing infectious diseases, delays in vaccinations, and routine exposure in communal settings heighten children's susceptibility to infections. Despite this pressing need, a comprehensive exploration of research trends in this domain remains lacking. This study aims to address this gap by employing text mining and modeling techniques to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature, thereby identifying emerging research trends in infectious disease prevention among children.
METHODS: A cross-sectional text mining approach was adopted, focusing on journal articles published between January 1, 2003, and August 31, 2022. These articles, related to infectious disease prevention in children, were sourced from databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, and Korean RISS. The data underwent preprocessing using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python, with a semantic network analysis and topic modeling conducted using R software.
RESULTS: The final dataset comprised 509 journal articles extracted from multiple databases. The study began with a word frequency analysis to pinpoint relevant themes, subsequently visualized through a word cloud. Dominant terms encompassed ""vaccination,"" ""adolescent,"" ""infant,"" ""parent,"" ""family,"" ""school,"" ""country,"" ""household,"" ""community,"" ""HIV,"" ""HPV,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""influenza,"" and ""diarrhea."" The semantic analysis identified ""age"" as a key term across infection, control, and intervention discussions. Notably, the relationship between ""hand"" and ""handwashing"" was prominent, especially in educational contexts linked with ""school"" and ""absence."" Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling further delineated seven topics related to infectious disease prevention for children, encompassing (1) educational programs, (2) vaccination efforts, (3) family-level responses, (4) care for immunocompromised individuals, (5) country-specific responses, (6) school-based strategies, and (7) persistent threats from established infectious diseases.
CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes the indispensable role of personalized interventions tailored for various child demographics, highlighting the pivotal contributions of both parental guidance and school participation.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study provides insights into the complex public health challenges associated with preventing and managing infectious diseases in children. The insights derived could inform the formulation of evidence-based public health policies, steering practical interventions and fostering interdisciplinary synergy for holistic prevention strategies."

OBJECTIVE: This work investigates (1) the changes in the public's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines over time, (2) the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information on social media engagement and attitude change, and (3) the emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information ecosystem.
METHODS: We collected a data set of 12,553 COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking Facebook posts and their associated comments (N=122,362) from January 2020 to March 2022 and conducted a series of natural language processing and statistical analyses to investigate trends in public attitude toward the vaccine in COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts and comments, and emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 fact-checking information ecosystem.
RESULTS: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all COVID-19 vaccine posts peaked in May 2020 and then steadily decreased as the pandemic progressed (r=-0.92, df=21, t=-10.94, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.82, P<.001). The salience of COVID-19 vaccine entities was significantly lower in comments (mean 0.03, SD 0.03, t=39.28, P<.001) than in posts (mean 0.09, SD 0.11). Third-party fact checkers have been playing a more important role in more fact-checking over time (r=0.63, df=25, t=4.06, 95% CI 0.33-0.82, P<.001). COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical (r=0.81, df=25, t=6.88, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P<.001) and more confident (r=0.59, df=25, t=3.68, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, P=.001) over time. Although comments did not exhibit a significant increase in confidence over time, tentativeness in comments significantly decreased (r=-0.62, df=25, t=-3.94, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.31, P=.001). In addition, although hospitals receive less engagement than other information sources, the comments expressed more positive attitudinal valence in comments compared to other information sources (b=0.06, 95% CI 0.00-0.12, t=2.03, P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all posts about the vaccine steadily decreased after May 2020. As the pandemic progressed, third-party fact checkers played a larger role in posting fact-checking COVID-19 vaccine posts. COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical and more confident over time, reflecting increased confidence in posts. Similarly, tentativeness in comments decreased; this likewise suggests that public uncertainty diminished over time. COVID-19 fact-checking vaccine posts from hospitals yielded more positive attitudes toward vaccination than other information sources. At the same time, hospitals received less engagement than other information sources. This suggests that hospitals should invest more in generating engaging public health campaigns on social media."

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Exclusion criteria: 1) topic not pertinent to the main topic of the review; 2) all case reports, editorials, conference highlights were excluded. After a title and abstract first selection and a final full-text analysis has been performed. The results of the selected articles are presented.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The iatrogenic splenic injury rate during colorectal surgery is 0.96%. The iatrogenic injuries cause around 20% of all splenectomy. Ligaments over-traction is the most frequent mechanism of damage. The routine splenic flexure mobilization is a matter of scientific debate. Risk factors - open surgery, male sex, peripheral vascular disease, malignant neoplasia, diverticulitis, emergency surgery and teaching-hospital status. There is a risk difference according to the procedure: transverse colectomy has the highest risk, followed by left colectomy and total colectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine mobilization of the left colonic flexure is a debated topic. However, according to some authors (including our experience), this procedure is not a risk factor and it may be advantageous: 1) it does not excessively prolong the total operative time; 2) better surgical skills development; 3) the tension-related ischemia is avoided; 4) wider oncological dissection. Technical accuracy with cautious dissection/visualization can reduce the rate of iatrogenic splenic damage. Laparoscopy decreases the rate of splenic injury by almost 3.5 times. Robotic surgery may have the potential to further reduce this complication, but more data are needed on the topic."

Information from the EHRs was extracted using artificial intelligence techniques and analyzed using Savana Manager 4.0 software.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 708,047 registered patients (54.7% females), 544 patients (0.08%; 330 women, 60.7%; mean age at diagnosis 53.0±15.8 yr) were diagnosed with acromegaly. The incidence of cancer was higher in patients with acromegaly vs those without this condition (7.7% vs 3.9%, p<0.001; OR, 2.047, 95%CI, 1.493-2.804). Male acromegalic patients had a higher prevalence of cancer vs females (57.1% vs 42.9%, p=0.012). A significantly higher prevalence of colorectal cancer (2.9% vs 1.4%, p=0.006), bladder cancer (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.005), and lymphoma (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.009) was observed in patients with acromegaly vs those without the condition. Acromegalic men had significantly higher prevalence rates of colorectal cancer (4.7% vs 1.3%, p=0.001), bladder cancer (2.8% vs 0.4%, p<0.001), breast cancer (0.9% vs 0.2%, p=0.042), gastric cancer (0.9% vs 0.1%, p=0.011), lymphoma (1.4% vs 0.3%, p=0.037), and liver cancer (0.9% vs 0.1%, p=0.012) vs non-acromegalic men. On the other hand, acromegalic women showed a higher prevalence of thyroid cancer (1.2% vs 0.4%, p=0.043) vs non-acromegalic women.
CONCLUSION: Our study, based on artificial intelligence techniques and analysis of real-world data and information, revealed a significant association between acromegaly and cancer in our hospital population, mainly acromegalic men, with a higher frequency of colorectal cancer, bladder cancer and lymphoma in particular."

Online ahead of print.,Amiri M,Br J Clin Pharmacol,2021,2021/03/26,,,10.1111/bcp.14836,"AIM: To describe the trend in the prevalence of statistical inference in three influential clinical pharmacology journals METHODS: We applied a computer-based algorithm to abstracts of three clinical pharmacology journals published in 1976 to 2016 to identify statistical inference and its subtypes. Furthermore, we manually reviewed a random sample of 300 articles to access algorithm's performance in finding statistical inference in abstracts and as a screening tool for presence and absence of statistical inference in full text.
RESULT: The algorithm identified 59% (13,375/22,516 [mid p 95% CI, 59%-60%]) article abstracts with statistical inference. The percentage of abstracts with statistical inference was similar in 1976 and 2016, 48% (179/377 [mid p 95%CI, 42%-52%]) versus 49% (386/791 [mid p 95%CI, 45%-52%]). Statistical reporting pattern varied among journals. Among abstracts containing any statistical inference in the publications from 1976 to 2016 null-hypothesis significance testing was the most prevalent reported statistical inference. The algorithm had high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for finding statistical inferences in abstract. While PPV for predicting the statistical inference in full text (including abstract, text, tables and figures) was high, NPV was low.
CONCLUSION: Despite journal's editorials and statistical associations' guidelines, most authors focused on testing rather than estimation. In future, a better statistical reporting might be ensured by improving the statistical knowledge of authors and an addition of statistical guides to journals' instruction to authors to the extent that editors would like their statistical inference preferences to be incorporated into submitted manuscripts."

However, ECT is among the most stigmatized and controversial treatments in medicine. Our objective was to examine social media contents on Twitter related to ECT to identify and evaluate public views on the matter.
METHODS: We collected Twitter posts in English and Spanish mentioning ECT between January 1, 2019 and October 31, 2020. Identified tweets were subject to a mixed method quantitative-qualitative content and sentiment analysis combining manual and semi-supervised natural language processing machine-learning analyses. Such analyses identified the distribution of tweets, their public interest (retweets and likes per tweet), and sentiment for the observed different categories of Twitter users and contents.
RESULTS: ""Healthcare providers"" users produced more tweets (25%) than ""people with lived experience"" and their ""relatives"" (including family members and close friends or acquaintances) (10% combined), and were the main publishers of ""medical"" content (mostly related to ECT's main indications). However, more than half of the total tweets had ""joke or trivializing"" contents, and such had a higher like and retweet ratio. Among those tweets manifesting personal opinions on ECT, around 75% of them had a negative sentiment.
CONCLUSIONS: Mixed method analysis of social media contents on Twitter offers a novel perspective to examine public opinion on ECT, and our results show attitudes more negative than those reflected in studies using surveys and other traditional methods."

OBJECTIVE: To develop a method that includes text mining of electronic clinical notes to reliably and efficiently measure HAIs for CIED procedures.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter, national cohort study using electronic medical record data for patients undergoing CIED procedures in Veterans Health Administration (VA) facilities for fiscal years (FYs) 2016 and 2017, an algorithm to flag cases with a true CIED-related infection based on structured (eg, microbiology orders, vital signs) and free text diagnostic and therapeutic data (eg, procedure notes, discharge summaries, microbiology results) was developed and validated. Procedure data were divided into development and validation data sets. Criterion validity (ie, positive predictive validity [PPV], sensitivity, and specificity) was assessed via criterion-standard manual medical record review.
EXPOSURES: CIED procedure.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The concordance between medical record review and the study algorithm with respect to the presence or absence of a CIED infection. CIED infection in the algorithm included 90-day mortality, congestive heart failure and nonmetastatic tumor comorbidities, CIED or surgical site infection International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes, antibiotic treatment of Staphylococci, a microbiology test of a cardiac specimen, and text documentation of infection in specific clinical notes (eg, cardiology, infectious diseases, inpatient discharge summaries).
RESULTS: The algorithm sample consisted of 19 212 CIED procedures; 15 077 patients (78.5%) were White individuals, 1487 (15.5%) were African American; 18 766 (97.7%) were men. The mean (SD) age in our sample was 71.8 (10.6) years. The infection detection threshold of predicted probability was set to greater than 0.10 and the algorithm flagged 276 of 9606 (2.9%) cases in the development data set (9606 procedures); PPV in this group was 41.4% (95% CI, 31.6%-51.8%). In the validation set (9606 procedures), at predicted probability 0.10 or more the algorithm PPV was 43.5% (95% CI, 37.1%-50.2%), and overall sensitivity and specificity were 94.4% (95% CI, 88.2%-97.9%) and 48.8% (95% CI, 42.6%-55.1%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that the method of combining structured and text data in VA electronic medical records can be used to expand infection surveillance beyond traditional boundaries to include outpatient and procedural areas."

The World Health Organization has also declared an infodemic (ie, a plethora of information regarding COVID-19 containing both false and accurate information circulated on the internet). Hence, it has become critical to test the veracity of information shared online and analyze the evolution of discussed topics among citizens related to the pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: This research analyzes the public discourse on COVID-19. It characterizes risk communication patterns in four Asian countries with outbreaks at varying degrees of severity: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India.
METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 from four Asian countries in the early phase of the disease outbreak from January to March 2020. The data set was collected by relevant keywords in each language, as suggested by locals. We present a method to automatically extract a time-topic cohesive relationship in an unsupervised fashion based on natural language processing. The extracted topics were evaluated qualitatively based on their semantic meanings.
RESULTS: This research found that each government's official phases of the epidemic were not well aligned with the degree of public attention represented by the daily tweet counts. Inspired by the issue-attention cycle theory, the presented natural language processing model can identify meaningful transition phases in the discussed topics among citizens. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topic diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper compares similarities and differences of pandemic-related social media discourse in Asian countries. We observed multiple prominent peaks in the daily tweet counts across all countries, indicating multiple issue-attention cycles. Our analysis identified which topics the public concentrated on; some of these topics were related to misinformation and hate speech. These findings and the ability to quickly identify key topics can empower global efforts to fight against an infodemic during a pandemic."
36604705,A scoping review on the impact of austerity on healthcare access in the European Union: rethinking austerity for the most vulnerable,"Doetsch JN, Schlösser C, Barros H, Shaw D, Krafft T, Pilot E.",Int J Equity Health. 2023 Jan 5;22(1):3. doi: 10.1186/s12939-022-01806-1.,Doetsch JN,Int J Equity Health,2023,2023/01/05,PMC9815671,,10.1186/s12939-022-01806-1,"BACKGROUND: There is consensus that the 2008 financial and economic crisis and related austerity measures adversely impacted access to healthcare. In light of the growing debt caused by the COVID-19 crisis, it is uncertain whether a period of austerity will return.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a structured overview of the impact of austerity policies in the EU-28 zone, applied in response to the Great Recession, on access to health care for the adult population, using the five access dimensions by Levesque et al. (2013).
METHODS: This study followed the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guideline. Medline (PubMed) and Web of Science were searched between February 2021 and June 2021. Primary studies in the English language published after the 1st of January 2008 reporting on the possible change in access to the healthcare system for the adult population induced by austerity in an EU28 country were included.
RESULTS: The final search strategy resulted in 525 articles, of which 75 studies were reviewed for full-text analysis, and a total of 21 studies were included. Results revealed that austerity policy has been primarily associated with a reduction in access to healthcare, described through four main categories: i) Increase in rates of reported unmet needs (86%); ii) Affordability (38%); iii) Appropriateness (38%); iv) and Availability and Accommodation (19%). Vulnerable populations were more affected by austerity measures than the general population when specific safeguards were not in place. The main affected adult vulnerable population groups were: patients with chronic diseases, elderly people, (undocumented) migrants, unemployed, economically inactive people and individuals with lower levels of education or socioeconomic status.
CONCLUSION: Austerity measures have led to a deterioration in access to healthcare in the vast majority of the countries studied in the EU-28 zone. Findings should prompt policymakers to rethink the fiscal agenda across all policies in times of economic crisis and focus on the needs of the most vulnerable populations from the health perspective."

Epub 2023 Jan 13.,Starmans NLP,J Neurol Sci,2023,2023/01/20,,,10.1016/j.jns.2023.120551,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is an important contributor to cognitive impairment. This likely involves prototypical vascular disease mechanisms like ischemia, but cardiovascular disease might also impact the brain by accelerating cerebral amyloid-β accumulation. We aimed to determine whether there is an association between heart disease or carotid occlusive disease (COD) and cerebral amyloid-β burden.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating cerebral amyloid-β burden, measured with positron emission tomography, in adults with and without heart disease or COD. Where possible, we obtained standardized mean differences (SMD) of amyloid-β standardized uptake volume ratios (SUVr) for meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eight cross-sectional studies were identified (1478 participants, aged 60-81 years, 51% female). Three studies on heart disease (two on atrial fibrillation (AF) only, one on AF, coronary artery disease and heart failure) did not find a difference in amyloid-β burden between patients and controls. The pooled difference for 746 participants with and without AF did not reach significance (SMD SUVr 0.14, 95%CI -0.06-0.34). Of the five studies on COD (one on differences between participants with and without COD, four on differences between hemispheres in unilateral COD), four did not find a difference in amyloid-β between participants or hemispheres. The pooled difference in amyloid-β load between hemispheres in 24 patients with unilateral COD was not significant (SMD SUVr -0.13, 95%CI -0.70-0.43).
CONCLUSION: Based on current studies, although limited and heterogeneous, there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that heart disease or COD are associated with increased cerebral amyloid-β burden."

Current diagnostic methods rely on motor symptoms and invasive procedures, making early detection difficult. This study established a transferable artificial intelligence (AI) model, Quest2Dx, to analyze health questionnaires to enable low-cost and non-invasive PD diagnosis. Quest2Dx tackles the common challenges of missing responses and required specific modeling for each questionnaire by developing a novel language modeling approach to allow the model transfer across different questionnaires and to enhance the interpretability. Evaluated on the PPMI and Fox Insight datasets, Quest2Dx achieved AUROCs of 0.977 and 0.974, respectively, significantly outperforming existing methods. Additionally, cross-questionnaire validation achieved AUROCs of 0.920 and 0.952, respectively, from PPMI to Fox Insight and vice versa. Quest2Dx also identified key predictors from the list of questions to provide further insights. The validated technology elucidates a promising path for PD screening in primary-care settings."

This review examined the prognostic role of fault on health, mental health, pain and work outcomes after transport injury. A systematic search of five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) yielded 16,324 records published between 2000 and January 2018. Eligibility criteria were: adult transport injury survivors; prospective design; multivariable analysis; fault-related factor analysed; pain, mental health, general health or work-related outcome. Citations (n = 10,558, excluding duplicates) and full text articles (n = 555) were screened manually (Reviewer 1), and using concurrent machine learning and text mining (Reviewer 2; using Abstrackr, WordStat and QDA miner). Data from 55 papers that met all inclusion criteria were extracted, papers were evaluated for risk of bias using the QUIPS tool, and overall level of evidence was assessed using the GRADE tool. There were six main fault-related factors classified as: fault or responsibility, fault-based compensation, lawyer involvement or litigation, blame or guilt, road user or position in vehicle, and impact direction. Overall there were inconsistent associations between fault and transport injury outcomes, and 60% of papers had high risk of bias. There was moderate evidence that fault-based compensation claims were associated with poorer health-related outcomes, and that lawyer involvement was associated with poorer work outcomes beyond 12 months post-injury. However, the evidence of negative associations between fault-based compensation claims and work-related outcomes was limited. Lawyer involvement and fault-based compensation claims were associated with adverse mental health outcomes six months post-injury, but not beyond 12 months. The most consistent associations between fault and negative outcomes were not for fault attributions, per se, but were related to fault-related procedures (e.g., lawyer engagement, fault-based compensation claims)."

Data are obtained from multiple sources, including service-specific surveys and widely used generic surveys. There are concerns about the timeliness of feedback, that some groups of patients and carers do not give feedback and that free-text feedback may be useful but is difficult to analyse.
OBJECTIVE: To understand how to improve the collection and usefulness of patient experience data in services for people with long-term conditions using digital data capture and improved analysis of comments.
DESIGN: The DEPEND study is a mixed-methods study with four parts: qualitative research to explore the perspectives of patients, carers and staff; use of computer science text-analytics methods to analyse comments; co-design of new tools to improve data collection and usefulness; and implementation and process evaluation to assess use of the tools and any impacts.
SETTING: Services for people with severe mental illness and musculoskeletal conditions at four sites as exemplars to reflect both mental health and physical long-terms conditions: an acute trust (site A), a mental health trust (site B) and two general practices (sites C1 and C2).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 100 staff members with diverse roles in patient experience management, clinical practice and information technology; 59 patients and 21 carers participated in the qualitative research components.
INTERVENTIONS: The tools comprised a digital survey completed using a tablet device (kiosk) or a pen and paper/online version; guidance and information for patients, carers and staff; text-mining programs; reporting templates; and a process for eliciting and recording verbal feedback in community mental health services.
RESULTS: We found a lack of understanding and experience of the process of giving feedback. People wanted more meaningful and informal feedback to suit local contexts. Text mining enabled systematic analysis, although challenges remained, and qualitative analysis provided additional insights. All sites managed to collect feedback digitally; however, there was a perceived need for additional resources, and engagement varied. Observation indicated that patients were apprehensive about using kiosks but often would participate with support. The process for collecting and recording verbal feedback in mental health services made sense to participants, but was not successfully adopted, with staff workload and technical problems often highlighted as barriers. Staff thought that new methods were insightful, but observation did not reveal changes in services during the testing period.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital methods can produce some improvements in the collection and usefulness of feedback. Context and flexibility are important, and digital methods need to be complemented with alternative methods. Text mining can provide useful analysis for reporting on large data sets within large organisations, but qualitative analysis may be more useful for small data sets and in small organisations.
LIMITATIONS: New practices need time and support to be adopted and this study had limited resources and a limited testing time.
FUTURE WORK: Further research is needed to improve text-analysis methods for routine use in services and to evaluate the impact of methods (digital and non-digital) on service improvement in varied contexts and among diverse patients and carers.

The aims of this study are to demonstrate the use of Twitter as a real-time method of Ebola outbreak surveillance to monitor information spread, capture early epidemic detection, and examine content of public knowledge and attitudes.
METHODS: We collected tweets mentioning Ebola in English during the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak from July 24-August 1, 2014. Our analysis for this observational study includes time series analysis with geologic visualization to observe information dissemination and content analysis using natural language processing to examine public knowledge and attitudes.
RESULTS: A total of 42,236 tweets (16,499 unique and 25,737 retweets) mentioning Ebola were posted and disseminated to 9,362,267,048 people, 63 times higher than the initial number. Tweets started to rise in Nigeria 3-7 days prior to the official announcement of the first probable Ebola case. The topics discussed in tweets include risk factors, prevention education, disease trends, and compassion.
CONCLUSION: Because of the analysis of a unique Twitter dataset captured in the early stage of the current Ebola outbreak, our results provide insight into the intersection of social media and public health outbreak surveillance. Findings demonstrate the usefulness of Twitter mining to inform public health education."

Epub 2019 May 21.,Barbour K,Epilepsia,2019,2019/05/22,,,10.1111/epi.15966,"OBJECTIVE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important cause of mortality in epilepsy. However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability.
METHODS: Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic-clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three ""boilerplate"" standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance.
RESULTS: We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data.
SIGNIFICANCE: Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk. Our methods may be implemented to create large patient cohorts for research and to generate electronic prompts for SUDEP counseling."

Epub 2018 Feb 3.,Galper BZ,Am Heart J,2018,2018/04/15,,,10.1016/j.ahj.2017.10.013,"BACKGROUND: Although outcomes data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral valve repair (Mitraclip) are available via the Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) registry, dissemination of TVT data is often delayed. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) system collects postmarket outcomes data in public medical device reports. We used natural language processing to compare the event rates for TAVR and Mitraclip in the TVT registry and from MAUDE data.
METHODS: We identified all medical device reports related to TAVR and Mitraclip from December 2011 through December 2014. Our primary objective was to demonstrate that event rates in TVT and MAUDE were not significantly different. We also compared TVT event rates for TAVRs performed in 2014 to MAUDE-derived event rates for the Sapien XT and CoreValve devices, both Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2014.
RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated close correlation between TVT and MAUDE rates for both TAVR and Mitraclip, with R2 values of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. The rates for all events except bleeding were not statistically significantly different. We demonstrated similar increased rates of permanent pacemaker implantation in the 2014 TVT and MAUDE data sets consistent with approval of the CoreValve.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that natural language processing technology sorted through raw MAUDE data, allowing identification of the most common events associated with TAVR and Mitraclip procedures, and that MAUDE-derived event rates were not statistically significantly different from TVT event rates. This technology has important public health implications because it improves postmarket surveillance of implantable devices and permits rapid and early dissemination of vital information."

It has become a challenge to comprehend such a rapid expansion of the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the conceptual content of National Health Insurance Research Database-based cancer research, using the abstract of articles extracted from PubMed between 2002 and 2015. Search terms including ""National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) AND Taiwan,"" ""Taiwan AND population-based,"" and ""Taiwan AND nationwide"" were used to search in PubMed with the publication date limited to between 1997 and 2015. The retrieved articles were manually screened to retain only those that were cancer-related and were based on secondary data analysis of the NHIRD. A total 589 articles were selected for subsequent text mining using the R software. Among the 589 articles, the top 5 most studied cancer types were breast (16.3%), lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.4%), liver (8.3%), and prostate (7.5%). The articles that received the highest number of citations by PubMed Central articles were cited 92 times. The top 3 most frequently occurred keywords in the abstracts of the 589 articles were cancer, patient, and risk, with 3670, 2535, and 1652 times, respectively. Analysis of key conception indicated that the most common conceptions were diabetes, survival, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. In conclusion, in this study of 589 published articles on secondary data analysis of the NHIRD, indexed by PubMed between 2002 and 2015, we found that while the risk factors of cancer, treatment of cancer, and survival of cancer patients were popular research topics, end-of-life cancer care issues were less studied. Further studies should explore these areas since they are as important as treatment of the disease itself for many patients."

Clinical outcomes following these two modalities remains a topic of debate. This systematic review critically appraises the literature to compare them following these treatment options.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to test the null hypothesis of no difference in clinical outcomes in ORIF versus closed treatment of mandibular condyle fractures. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Elsevier text mining tool database, and clinicaltrials.gov trial registries were queried from 1946 to 2020. The quality of evidence was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.
RESULTS: Of 1507 screened articles, 14 met inclusion criteria. ORIF was favored significantly when evaluating temporomandibular joint pain [relative risk (RR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.7] (number needed to treat to prevent an outcome in one patient, 3; 95% CI, 2 to 6), laterotrusive movements of the mandible (mean difference, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7 to 3.0) (standardized mean difference, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.3), and malocclusion (RR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7) (number needed to treat to prevent an outcome in one patient, 19; 95% CI, 10 to 200). However, ORIF yielded a higher incidence of postoperative infection (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.9 to 13.8) and must be weighed against the understood risk of facial nerve injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of high-level evidence in randomized controlled trial suggests that ORIF significantly improves functional outcomes, decreases pain, and restores occlusion and jaw symmetry. These long-term benefits must be weighed against the increased risk of postoperative infection and exposure of the facial nerve to potential injury."

Performance-based assessments, which have the strongest validity evidence, are currently not feasible for this purpose because they are time-intensive to score. This study explored the potential of using machine learning technologies to score one such assessment-the diagnostic justification essay.
METHOD: From May to September 2018, machine scoring algorithms were trained to score a sample of 700 diagnostic justification essays written by 414 third-year medical students from the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine classes of 2012-2017. The algorithms applied semantically based natural language processing metrics (e.g., coherence, readability) to assess essay quality on 4 criteria (differential diagnosis, recognition and use of findings, workup, and thought process); the scores for these criteria were summed to create overall scores. Three sources of validity evidence (response process, internal structure, and association with other variables) were examined.
RESULTS: Machine scores correlated more strongly with faculty ratings than faculty ratings did with each other (machine: .28-.53, faculty: .13-.33) and were less case-specific. Machine scores and faculty ratings were similarly correlated with medical knowledge, clinical cognition, and prior diagnostic justification. Machine scores were more strongly associated with clinical communication than were faculty ratings (.43 vs .31).
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning technologies may be useful for assessing medical students' long-form written clinical reasoning. Semantically based machine scoring may capture the communicative aspects of clinical reasoning better than faculty ratings, offering the potential for automated assessment that generalizes to the workplace. These results underscore the potential of machine scoring to capture an aspect of clinical reasoning performance that is difficult to assess with traditional analytic scoring methods. Additional research should investigate machine scoring generalizability and examine its acceptability to trainees and educators."

Nonetheless, the relationship between public health and populism extends before and beyond the pandemic. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of existing evidence and theoretical conceptualisations on the intersection of populism, health emergencies, and contrarian scientific positions, drawing from a diverse range of disciplines. I conducted a scoping review of 283 original studies, analysing their analytical framework, geographic focuses, and methodological approaches. Employing quantitative text analysis, I summarised the research field into 18 common topics, organised into five coherent categories: citizen's perspective, political elites, political communication, pandemic consequences, and non-COVID-related issues. While the scholarly interest in this area has surged since the onset of the pandemic, it has predominantly concentrated on specific cases, such as Brazil and the US, often conflating different policy types. The evidence summary elucidates that populism assumes varying roles within distinct contexts, and there is no linear relationship between political populism and specific approaches to health crises and science. I further compare definitions of populism within the context of health and scientific positions. I propose that future research should employ a policy typology for health emergency responses, assessing political positions based on policy arenas. This paper contributes to the understanding of the complex interplay between political populism, contrarian scientific perspectives, and public health."

This review aims to determine the prevalence of mental health problems among university students in six ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) and to identify the determinants of mental health. A systematic database search (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubPsych, and Scopus) for peer-reviewed, English language articles, published 2010-2020, reporting prevalence data based on standardized screening instruments resulted in 335 articles; 108 were eligible for full-text analysis, of which 34 could be included in the review. Median point prevalence was 29.4% for depression, 42.4% for anxiety, 16.4% for stress, and 13.9% for disordered eating. Current suicidality was present in 7% to 8% of students. There was a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity. Despite the high prevalence of mental health problems, the willingness to seek professional help was comparatively low. Implications for mental health promotion and prevention in university settings are discussed."

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate participant characteristics and other factors associated with response to an electronic health diary campaign in persons with multiple sclerosis, identify recurrent topics in free-text diary entries, and assess the added value of structured diary entries with regard to current symptoms and medication intake when compared with survey-collected information.
METHODS: Data were collected by the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry during a nested electronic health diary campaign and during a regular semiannual Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry follow-up survey serving as comparator. The characteristics of campaign participants were descriptively compared with those of nonparticipants. Diary content was analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software (Pennebaker Conglomerates, Inc) and descriptive keyword analyses. The similarities between structured diary data and follow-up survey data on health-related quality of life, symptoms, and medication intake were examined using the Jaccard index.
RESULTS: Campaign participants (n=134; diary entries: n=815) were more often women, were not working full time, did not have a higher education degree, had a more advanced gait impairment, and were on average 5 years older (median age 52.5, IQR 43.25-59.75 years) than eligible nonparticipants (median age 47, IQR 38-55 years; n=524). Diary free-text entries (n=632; participants: n=100) most often contained references to the following standard Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count word categories: negative emotion (193/632, 30.5%), body parts or body functioning (191/632, 30.2%), health (94/632, 14.9%), or work (67/632, 10.6%). Analogously, the most frequently mentioned keywords (diary entries: n=526; participants: n=93) were ""good,"" ""day,"" and ""work."" Similarities between diary data and follow-up survey data, collected 14 months apart (median), were high for health-related quality of life and stable for slow-changing symptoms such as fatigue or gait disorder. Similarities were also comparatively high for drugs requiring a regular application, including interferon beta-1a (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), and for modern oral therapies such as fingolimod (Gilenya) and teriflunomide (Aubagio).
CONCLUSIONS: Diary campaign participation seemed dependent on time availability and symptom burden and was enhanced by reminder emails. Electronic health diaries are a meaningful complement to regular structured surveys and can provide more detailed information regarding medication use and symptoms. However, they should ideally be embedded into promotional activities or tied to concrete research study tasks to enhance regular and long-term participation."

Respiratory symptoms after acute COVID-19 are widely reported in the general population, but large-scale studies identifying symptom risk for patients with asthma are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and compare risk for post-acute COVID-19 respiratory symptoms in patients with and without asthma.
METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study included COVID-19-positive patients between March 4, 2020, and January 20, 2021, with up to 180 days of health care follow-up in a health care system in the Northeastern United States. Respiratory symptoms recorded in clinical notes from days 28 to 180 after COVID-19 diagnosis were extracted using natural language processing. Cohorts were stratified by hospitalization status during the acute COVID-19 period. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare symptoms among patients with and without asthma adjusting for demographic and clinical confounders.
RESULTS: Among 31,084 eligible patients with COVID-19, 2863 (9.2%) had hospitalization during the acute COVID-19 period; 4049 (13.0%) had a history of asthma, accounting for 13.8% of hospitalized and 12.9% of nonhospitalized patients. In the post-acute COVID-19 period, patients with asthma had significantly higher risk of shortness of breath, cough, bronchospasm, and wheezing than patients without an asthma history. Incident respiratory symptoms of bronchospasm and wheezing were also higher in patients with asthma. Patients with asthma who had not been hospitalized during acute COVID-19 had additionally higher risk of cough, abnormal breathing, sputum changes, and a wider range of incident respiratory symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma may have an under-recognized burden of respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 warranting increased awareness and monitoring in this population."

Epub 2018 May 10.,Koopman B,Artif Intell Med,2018,2018/05/15,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2018.04.011,"OBJECTIVE: Death certificates are an invaluable source of cancer mortality statistics. However, this value can only be realised if accurate, quantitative data can be extracted from certificates-an aim hampered by both the volume and variable quality of certificates written in natural language. This paper proposes an automatic classification system for identifying all cancer related causes of death from death certificates.
METHODS: Detailed features, including terms, n-grams and SNOMED CT concepts were extracted from a collection of 447,336 death certificates. The features were used as input to two different classification sub-systems: a machine learning sub-system using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a rule-based sub-system. A fusion sub-system then combines the results from SVMs and rules into a single final classification. A held-out test set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifiers according to precision, recall and F-measure.
RESULTS: The system was highly effective at determining the type of cancers for both common cancers (F-measure of 0.85) and rare cancers (F-measure of 0.7). In general, rules performed superior to SVMs; however, the fusion method that combined the two was the most effective.
CONCLUSION: The system proposed in this study provides automatic identification and characterisation of cancers from large collections of free-text death certificates. This allows organisations such as Cancer Registries to monitor and report on cancer mortality in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, the methods and findings are generally applicable beyond cancer classification and to other sources of medical text besides death certificates."

Due to the wealth of information, EHR data have emerged as a powerful resource to make first discoveries and identify disparities in our healthcare system. While the number of EHR-based studies has exploded in recent years, most of these studies are directed at associations with disease rather than pharmacotherapeutic outcomes, such as drug response or adverse drug reactions. This is largely due to challenges specific to deriving drug-related phenotypes from the EHR. There is great potential for EHR-based discovery in clinical pharmacology research, and there is a critical need to address specific challenges related to accurate and reproducible derivation of drug-related phenotypes from the EHR. This review provides a detailed evaluation of challenges and considerations for deriving drug-related data from EHRs. We provide an examination of EHR-based computable phenotypes and discuss cutting-edge approaches to map medication information for clinical pharmacology research, including medication-based computable phenotypes and natural language processing. We also discuss additional considerations such as data structure, heterogeneity and missing data, rare phenotypes, and diversity within the EHR. By further understanding the complexities associated with conducting clinical pharmacology research using EHR-based data, investigators will be better equipped to design thoughtful studies with more reproducible results. Progress in utilizing EHRs for clinical pharmacology research should lead to significant advances in our ability to understand differential drug response and predict adverse drug reactions."

At present, no review of indexed publications studying their prevalence in Spain is available.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A scoping review (PROSPERO -CRD42019140884-) was carried out through systematic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO) until January 2022. Papers published in Spanish/English analysing the prevalence of EDs in Spain (population < 65 years) were selected.
RESULTS: A total of 766 articles were identified (186 eliminated as duplicates). A total of 580 articles were analysed on the basis of title and abstract, and 67 articles were selected for full-text analysis. A total of 37 studies analysed the prevalence of EDs in Spain.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first scoping review to analyse the prevalence of EDs in Spain. Puberty and adolescence are the most extensively studied stages. There is a high heterogeneity in the use of ED screening tools and a paucity of information on diagnostic tools."

Epub 2019 Apr 1.,Nunes AP,Curr Oncol,2019,2019/05/03,PMC6476436,,10.3747/co.26.4163,"BACKGROUND: Variations in treatment choice, or late stage at first diagnosis, mean that, despite guideline recommendations, not all patients with hormone receptor (hr)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (la/mbca) will have received endocrine therapy before disease progression. In the present study, we aimed to estimate the proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive la/mbca in the United States who are endocrine therapy-naïve.
METHODS: Women in the Optum Electronic Health Record (ehr) database with a breast cancer (bca) diagnosis (January 2008-March 2015) were included. Patient and malignancy characteristics were identified using structured data fields and natural-language processing of free-text clinical notes. The proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive, human epidermal growth factor 2 (her2)-negative (or unknown) la/mbca who had not received prior endocrine therapy was determined. Results were extrapolated to the entire U.S. population using the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Results are presented descriptively.
RESULTS: In the ehr database, 11,831 women with bca had discernible information on postmenopausal status, hr status, and disease stage. Of those women, 1923 (16.3%) had postmenopausal hr-positive, her2-negative (or unknown) la/mbca, and 70.7% of those 1923 patients (n = 1360) had not received prior endocrine therapy, accounting for 11.5% of the overall population. Extrapolating those estimates nationally suggests an annual incidence of 14,784 cases, and a 5-year limited duration prevalence of 50,638 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with postmenopausal hr-positive la/mbca in the United States could be endocrine therapy-naïve."

Adverse event reports are classified by the reporter as injury, malfunction, death, or other. If the device may have caused or contributed to a death, or if the cause of death is unknown, the FDA requires that the adverse event be reported as a death.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of medical device adverse event reports submitted to the MAUDE database that were not classified as death even though the patient died.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, a natural language processing algorithm was applied to the MAUDE database, followed by manual text review, to identify reports in the injury, malfunction, other or missing categories that included at least 1 term that suggested a patient death, such as patient died or patient expired, from December 31, 1991, to April 30, 2020, for any medical device.
EXPOSURES: Manual review of a random sample of 1000 adverse event reports not classified as death and of selected reports for 62 terms that are associated with deaths but were not classified as death.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of adverse event reports in which the patient was said to have died in the narrative section of the report but the reporter classified the report in a category other than death.
RESULTS: The terms in the natural language processing algorithm identified 290 141 reports in which a serious injury or death was reported. Of these, 151 145 (52.1%) were classified by the reporter as death and 47.9% were classified as malfunction, injury, other, or missing. For the overall sample, the percentage of reports with deaths that were not classified as deaths was 23% (95% CI, 20%-25%), suggesting that approximately 31 552 reports in our sample had deaths that were classified in other categories. The overall percentage of missed deaths, defined as the percentage of deaths that were classified in other categories, was 17% (95% CI, 16%-19%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many of the findings of this study suggest that many medical device adverse event reports in the FDA's MAUDE database that involved a patient death are classified in categories other than death. As the FDA only routinely reviews all adverse events that are reported as patient deaths, improving the accuracy of adverse event reporting may enhance patient safety."
30624314,Can Machine Learning Methods Produce Accurate and Easy-to-use Prediction Models of 30-day Complications and Mortality After Knee or Hip Arthroplasty?,"Harris AHS, Kuo AC, Weng Y, Trickey AW, Bowe T, Giori NJ.",Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2019 Feb;477(2):452-460. doi: 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000601.,Harris AHS,Clin Orthop Relat Res,2019,2019/01/10,PMC6370104,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000000601,"BACKGROUND: Existing universal and procedure-specific surgical risk prediction models of death and major complications after elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have limitations including poor transparency, poor to modest accuracy, and insufficient validation to establish performance across diverse settings. Thus, the need remains for accurate and validated prediction models for use in preoperative management, informed consent, shared decision-making, and risk adjustment for reimbursement.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to use machine learning methods and large national databases to develop and validate (both internally and externally) parsimonious risk-prediction models for mortality and complications after TJA.
METHODS: Preoperative demographic and clinical variables from all 107,792 nonemergent primary THAs and TKAs in the 2013 to 2014 American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) were evaluated as predictors of 30-day death and major complications. The NSQIP database was chosen for its high-quality data on important outcomes and rich characterization of preoperative demographic and clinical predictors for demographically and geographically diverse patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, a type of machine learning that optimizes accuracy and parsimony, was used for model development. Tenfold validation was used to produce C-statistics, a measure of how well models discriminate patients who experience an outcome from those who do not. External validation, which evaluates the generalizability of the models to new data sources and patient groups, was accomplished using data from the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). Models previously developed from VASQIP data were also externally validated using NSQIP data to examine the generalizability of their performance with a different group of patients outside the VASQIP context.
RESULTS: The models, developed using LASSO regression with diverse clinical (for example, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, comorbidities) and demographic (for example, age, gender) inputs, had good accuracy in terms of discriminating the likelihood a patient would experience, within 30 days of arthroplasty, a renal complication (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.80), death (0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.76), or a cardiac complication (0.73; 95% CI, 0.71-0.75) from one who would not. By contrast, the models demonstrated poor accuracy for venous thromboembolism (C-statistic, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.60-0.62) and any complication (C-statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.63-0.65). External validation of the NSQIP- derived models using VASQIP data found them to be robust in terms of predictions about mortality and cardiac complications, but not for predicting renal complications. Models previously developed with VASQIP data had poor accuracy when externally validated with NSQIP data, suggesting they should not be used outside the context of the Veterans Health Administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderately accurate predictive models of 30-day mortality and cardiac complications after elective primary TJA were developed as well as internally and externally validated. To our knowledge, these are the most accurate and rigorously validated TJA-specific prediction models currently available (http://med.stanford.edu/s-spire/Resources/clinical-tools-.html). Methods to improve these models, including the addition of nonstandard inputs such as natural language processing of preoperative clinical progress notes or radiographs, should be pursued as should the development and validation of models to predict longer term improvements in pain and function.

However, there are many challenges in this regard. In the present study, the solutions and challenges of implementing EHR-based disease surveillance systems (EHR-DS) have been reviewed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the related keywords in ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus. Then, we assessed and selected articles using the inclusion and exclusion criteria and, finally, classified the identified solutions and challenges.
RESULTS: Finally, 50 studies were included, and 52 unique solutions and 47 challenges were organized into 6 main themes (policy and regulatory, technical, management, standardization, financial, and data quality). The results indicate that due to the multifaceted nature of the challenges, the implementation of EHR-DS is not low cost and easy to implement and requires a variety of interventions. On the one hand, the most common challenges include the need to invest significant time and resources; the poor data quality in EHRs; difficulty in analyzing, cleaning, and accessing unstructured data; data privacy and security; and the lack of interoperability standards. On the other hand, the most common solutions are the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for unstructured data; the use of appropriate technical solutions for data retrieval, extraction, identification, and visualization; the collaboration of health and clinical departments to access data; standardizing EHR content for public health; and using a unique health identifier for individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: EHR systems have an important role in modernizing disease surveillance systems. However, there are many problems and challenges facing the development and implementation of EHR-DS that need to be appropriately addressed."

Recent federal initiatives promote the use of RWD to make clinical assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical assertions, also known as ""regulatory-grade"" RWE.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 2010-2016.
METHODS: A predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured (EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy were compared using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: The dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%, respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded criteria, with the exception of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based studes intended for regulatory use. Furthermore, advanced data and technologies may be required to achieve regulatory grade results."

METHODS: Two authors independently conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed/MedLine, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify papers analyzing the prevalence of POAG in European countries. After removal of duplicates, title and abstract screening, and full-text analysis, data from selected articles were entered in an Excel spreadsheet. We performed risk of bias assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool and conducted a meta-analysis using the R software (version 1.4.1106).
RESULTS: We retrieved 9348 eligible papers from the initial electronic search and included 10 of them in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of 26,993 patients were included in this meta-analysis (11,927 male and 14,556 female). We identified 755 POAG cases (397 male and 348 female), with a pooled prevalence estimate in Europe of 2.60% (95% confidence interval: 1.90%-3.56%). Increasing odds for POAG were related to increasing age and some geographic differences in the disease distribution in the continent were identified. Statistically significant sex-related differences in the prevalence rate of POAG were not observed in this cohort.
CONCLUSION: POAG is a neurodegenerative disease that affects a large proportion of the older European population. In the future, the prevalence of POAG is expected to grow in Europe because of the progressive aging populations of Western countries. Future high-quality epidemiological studies for the evaluation of POAG prevalence rates are warranted."

However, the relationship between language and high-order cognition seems to evade this canonical and unidirectional description (ie, the notion of language as a simple means of thought communication). In recent years, clinical high at-risk mental state (CHARMS) criteria (evolved from the Ultra-High-Risk paradigm) and the introduction of the Clinical Staging system have been proposed to address the dynamicity of early psychopathology. At the same time, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have greatly evolved and have been successfully applied to investigate different neuropsychiatric conditions. The combination of at-risk mental state paradigm, clinical staging system and automated NLP methods, the latter applied on spoken language transcripts, could represent a useful and convenient approach to the problem of early psychopathological distress within a transdiagnostic risk paradigm.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Help-seeking young people presenting psychological distress (CHARMS+/- and Clinical Stage 1a or 1b; target sample size for both groups n=90) will be assessed through several psychometric tools and multiple speech analyses during an observational period of 1-year, in the context of an Italian multicentric study. Subjects will be enrolled in different contexts: Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa-IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy; Mental Health Department-territorial mental services (ASL 3-Genoa), Genoa, Italy; and Mental Health Department-territorial mental services (AUSL-Piacenza), Piacenza, Italy. The conversion rate to full-blown psychopathology (CS 2) will be evaluated over 2 years of clinical observation, to further confirm the predictive and discriminative value of CHARMS criteria and to verify the possibility of enriching them with several linguistic features, derived from a fine-grained automated linguistic analysis of speech.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The methodology described in this study adheres to ethical principles as formulated in the Declaration of Helsinki and is compatible with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-good clinical practice. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by two different ethics committees (CER Liguria approval code: 591/2020-id.10993; Comitato Etico dell'Area Vasta Emilia Nord approval code: 2022/0071963). Participants will provide their written informed consent prior to study enrolment and parental consent will be needed in the case of participants aged less than 18 years old. Experimental results will be carefully shared through publication in peer-reviewed journals, to ensure proper data reproducibility.

Our objectives were to curate information about xylazine through social media from People Who Use Drugs (PWUDs). Specifically, we sought to answer the following: 1) what are the demographics of Reddit subscribers reporting exposure to xylazine? 2) is xylazine a desired additive? and 3) what adverse effects of xylazine are PWUDs experiencing?
METHODS: Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to identify mentions of ""xylazine"" from posts by Reddit subscribers who also posted on drug-related subreddits. Posts were qualitatively evaluated for xylazine-related themes. A survey was developed to gather additional information about the Reddit subscribers. This survey was posted on subreddits that were identified by NLP to contain xylazine-related discussions from March 2022 to October 2022.
RESULTS: 76 posts mentioning xylazine were extracted via NLP from 765,616 posts by 16,131 Reddit subscribers (January 2018 to August 2021). People on Reddit described xylazine as an unwanted adulterant in their opioid supply. 61 participants completed the survey. Of those that disclosed their location, 25/50 (50%) participants reported locations in the Northeastern United States. The most common eoute of xylazine use was intranasal use (57%). 31/59 (53%) reported experiencing xylazine withdrawal. Frequent adverse events reported were prolonged sedation (81%) and increased skin wounds (43%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among respondents on these Reddit forums, xylazine appears to be an unwanted adulterant. PWUDs may be experiencing adverse effects such as prolonged sedation and xylazine withdrawal. This appeared to be more common in the Northeast."

OBJECTIVE: To develop a computerized algorithm to determine CC prevalence and its characteristics.
DESIGN: This observational study using administrative data identified hierarchically patients aged 18 to 85 years with CC from 2013 to 2016. First, a specialist-diagnosed CC group was identified using an internal CC encounter code during an outpatient visit to a pulmonologist, allergist, otolaryngologist, or gastroenterologist. Subsequently, an event-diagnosed CC group was identified based on clinical notes through natural language processing, ICD-9/ICD-10 cough codes, and dispensed antitussives.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of CC and comparison of clinical characteristics between specialist-diagnosed and event-diagnosed CC subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 50,163 patients with CC of more than 8 weeks were identified. Of these, 11,290 (22.5%) were specialist diagnosed, and 38,873 (77.5%) were event diagnosed. The CC cohort was 57.4 ± 16.5 years of age; 67.6% were female. The overall prevalence was 1.04% (95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.06) in 2016. Prevalence in 2016 was higher in female patients (1.21%) than in male patients (0.81%), higher in patients aged 65 to 85 years (2.2%) than in patients aged 18 to 44 years (0.43%), and higher in Blacks (1.38%) than in Whites (1.21%). Compared with patients with event-diagnosed CC, patients with specialist-diagnosed CC exhibited significantly higher frequencies of laboratory tests and respiratory and nonrespiratory comorbidities and dispensed medication and lower frequency of pneumonia, all-cause and respiratory-cause emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and dispensed antitussives.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a CC cohort using electronic data in a managed care organization. Prevalences varied by sex, age, and ethnicity. Clinical characteristics varied between specialist-diagnosed and event-diagnosed CC."

We develop and validate algorithms that predict the risk of PDAC using features identified on cross-sectional imaging and other clinical characteristics collected through electronic medical records.
METHODS: Adult patients with abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in January 2006 to June 2016 demonstrating dilatation of main pancreatic duct were identified. Pancreas-related morphologic features were extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing. The cumulative incidence of PDAC with death as a competing risk was estimated using multistate models. Model discrimination was assessed using c-index. The models were internally validated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 7819 patients (mean age, 71 years; 65% female). A total of 781 patients (10%) developed PDAC within 3 years after the first eligible imaging study. The final models achieved reasonable discrimination (c-index, 0.825-0.833). The 3-year average risk of PDAC in the top 5% of the total eligible patients was 56.0%, more than 20 times of the average risk among the bottom 50% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models combining imaging features and clinical measures can be used to further stratify the risk of pancreatic cancer among patients with pancreas ductal dilatation."

We created a natural language processing algorithm to identify patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) using text alone.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We created 3 data sets from patients with at least one AF billing code from 2010 to 2017: a training set (n=886), an internal validation set from site no. 1 (n=285), and an external validation set from site no. 2 (n=276). A team of clinicians reviewed and adjudicated patients as AF present or absent, which served as the reference standard. We trained 54 algorithms to classify each patient, varying the model, number of features, number of stop words, and the method used to create the feature set. The algorithm with the highest F-score (the harmonic mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value) in the training set was applied to the validation sets. F-scores and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves were compared between site no. 1 and site no. 2 using bootstrapping. Adjudicated AF prevalence was 75.1% at site no. 1 and 86.2% at site no. 2. Among 54 algorithms, the best performing model was logistic regression, using 1000 features, 100 stop words, and term frequency-inverse document frequency method to create the feature set, with sensitivity 92.8%, specificity 93.9%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 in the training set. The performance at site no. 1 was sensitivity 92.5%, specificity 88.7%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. The performance at site no. 2 was sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 71.1%, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80. The F-score was lower at site no. 2 compared with site no. 1 (92.5% [SD, 1.1%] versus 94.2% [SD, 1.1%]; P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a natural language processing algorithm to identify patients with AF using text alone, with >90% F-score at 2 separate sites. This approach allows better use of the clinical narrative and creates an opportunity for precise, high-throughput cohort identification."

However, the current state of standardized SDoH data in electronic health records (EHRs) is lacking, a significant barrier to research and care quality.
METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search using ""SDOH"" and ""EHR"" Medical Subject Headings terms, analyzing included articles across five domains: 1) SDoH screening and assessment approaches, 2) SDoH data collection and documentation, 3) Use of natural language processing (NLP) for extracting SDoH, 4) SDoH data and health outcomes, and 5) SDoH-driven interventions.
RESULTS: Of 685 articles identified, 324 underwent full review. Key findings include implementation of tailored screening instruments, census and claims data linkage for contextual SDoH profiles, NLP systems extracting SDoH from notes, associations between SDoH and healthcare utilization and chronic disease control, and integrated care management programs. However, variability across data sources, tools, and outcomes underscores the need for standardization.
DISCUSSION: Despite progress in identifying patient social needs, further development of standards, predictive models, and coordinated interventions is critical for SDoH-EHR integration. Additional database searches could strengthen this scoping review. Ultimately, widespread capture, analysis, and translation of multidimensional SDoH data into clinical care is essential for promoting health equity."

However, no trials of statin utilization with clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) end points have been completed in PWH, and there are sparse real-world data regarding statin use and lipid-lowering effectiveness. We therefore used a unique cohort of PWH and uninfected controls to evaluate (1) differences in statin types used for PWH versus uninfected persons; (2) lipid lowering achieved by statin use for PWH versus uninfected persons; and (3) racial and ethnic disparities in appropriate statin use among PWH and uninfected persons.
METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 5,039 PWH and 10,011 uninfected demographically matched controls who received care at a large urban medical center between January 1, 2000, and May 17, 2017. Medication administration records, prescription data, and validated natural language processing algorithms were used to determine statin utilization. Statins were categorized by generic active ingredient name and intensity (high, moderate, or low). Lipid values collected in routine clinical care were available for analysis. The first set of analyses was restricted to PWH and uninfected matched controls taking statins and compared (1) differences in statin type and (2) difference in cholesterol levels after versus before statin initiation by HIV status. For the second set of analyses, we first used prevalent CVD risk factors to determine participants with statin indications and then determined how many of these participants were taking statins. We then compared statin utilization among persons with indications for statins by race/ethnic group for PWH and uninfected matched controls using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among people prescribed statins, PWH were more likely than controls to have ever taken pravastatin (34.8% vs 12.3%, P < .001) or atorvastatin (72.2% vs 65.6%, P = .002) and less likely to have ever taken simvastatin (14.2% vs 39.5%, P < .001). Among PWH with indications for statin utilization, 55.7% of whites, 39.4% of blacks, and 45.8% of Hispanics were prescribed statins (P < .001). These differences in statin prescription by race/ethnicity remained significant after adjustment for demographics (including insurance status), cardiovascular risk factors, antiretroviral therapy use, HIV viremia, and CD4 count. These racial/ethnic disparities in statin utilization were less pronounced among uninfected persons.
CONCLUSIONS: Among PWH with statin indication(s), blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to have been prescribed a statin. These racial/ethnic disparities were less pronounced among uninfected persons. There were significant differences in type of statin used for PWH compared to uninfected matched controls. Future efforts addressing disparities in CVD prevention among PWH are warranted."

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,Ball R,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2018,2018/08/29,,,10.1002/pds.4645,"INTRODUCTION: In May 2008, the Food and Drug Administration launched the Sentinel Initiative, a multi-year program for the establishment of a national electronic monitoring system for medical product safety that led, in 2016, to the launch of the full Sentinel System. Under the Mini-Sentinel pilot, several algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest, including one for anaphylaxis, were developed and evaluated using data available from the Sentinel common data model.
PURPOSE: To evaluate whether features extracted from unstructured narrative data using natural language processing (NLP) could be used to classify anaphylaxis cases.
METHODS: Using previously developed methods, we extracted features from unstructured narrative data using NLP and applied rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to identify anaphylaxis among 62 potential cases previously classified by human experts as anaphylaxis (N = 33), not anaphylaxis (N = 27), and unknown (N = 2).
RESULTS: The rule-based and similarity-based approaches demonstrated almost equal performance (recall 100% vs 100%, precision 60.3% vs 57.4%, F-measure: 0.753 vs 0.729). Reasons for misclassification included the inability of the algorithms to make the same clinical judgments as human experts about the timing, severity, or presence of alternative explanations; and the identification of terms consistent with anaphylaxis but present in conditions other than anaphylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: Although precision needs to be improved before these algorithms could be used without human review, we demonstrated that applying rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to unstructured narrative information from clinical records can be used for classification of anaphylaxis in the Sentinel System. Further development and assessment of these methods in the Sentinel System are warranted."

This study investigated associations between risk factors and late-life cognitive decline on a global scale, including comparisons between ethno-regional groups.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We harmonized longitudinal data from 20 population-based cohorts from 15 countries over 5 continents, including 48,522 individuals (58.4% women) aged 54-105 (mean = 72.7) years and without dementia at baseline. Studies had 2-15 years of follow-up. The risk factors investigated were age, sex, education, alcohol consumption, anxiety, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*4) status, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure and pulse pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, self-rated health, high cholesterol, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, physical activity, smoking, and history of stroke. Associations with risk factors were determined for a global cognitive composite outcome (memory, language, processing speed, and executive functioning tests) and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Individual participant data meta-analyses of multivariable linear mixed model results pooled across cohorts revealed that for at least 1 cognitive outcome, age (B = -0.1, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.31, SE = 0.11), depression (B = -0.11, SE = 0.06), diabetes (B = -0.23, SE = 0.10), current smoking (B = -0.20, SE = 0.08), and history of stroke (B = -0.22, SE = 0.09) were independently associated with poorer cognitive performance (p < 0.05 for all), and higher levels of education (B = 0.12, SE = 0.02) and vigorous physical activity (B = 0.17, SE = 0.06) were associated with better performance (p < 0.01 for both). Age (B = -0.07, SE = 0.01), APOE*4 carriage (B = -0.41, SE = 0.18), and diabetes (B = -0.18, SE = 0.10) were independently associated with faster cognitive decline (p < 0.05 for all). Different effects between Asian people and white people included stronger associations for Asian people between ever smoking and poorer cognition (group by risk factor interaction: B = -0.24, SE = 0.12), and between diabetes and cognitive decline (B = -0.66, SE = 0.27; p < 0.05 for both). Limitations of our study include a loss or distortion of risk factor data with harmonization, and not investigating factors at midlife.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that education, smoking, physical activity, diabetes, and stroke are all modifiable factors associated with cognitive decline. If these factors are determined to be causal, controlling them could minimize worldwide levels of cognitive decline. However, any global prevention strategy may need to consider ethno-regional differences."

One of the primary difficulties lies in the underreporting and underdiagnosis of psychosis, compounded by the stigma surrounding mental health and the individuals' often diminished insight into their condition. Existing efforts leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to retrospectively identify psychosis typically rely on structured data, such as medical codes and patient demographics, which frequently lack essential information. Addressing these challenges, our study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze psychiatric admission notes for the diagnosis of psychosis, providing a detailed evaluation of rule-based algorithms, machine learning models, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, the study investigates the effectiveness of employing keywords to streamline extensive note data before training and evaluating the models. Analyzing 4,617 initial psychiatric admission notes (1,196 cases of psychosis versus 3,433 controls) from 2005 to 2019, we discovered that the XGBoost classifier employing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features derived from notes pre-selected by expert-curated keywords, attained the highest performance with an F1 score of 0.8881 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.9725 [0.9717, 0.9733]). BlueBERT demonstrated comparable efficacy an F1 score of 0.8841 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.9580, 0.9820]) on the same set of notes. Both models markedly outperformed traditional International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based detection methods from discharge summaries, which had an F1 score of 0.7608, thus improving the margin by 0.12. Furthermore, our findings indicate that keyword pre-selection markedly enhances the performance of both machine learning and pre-trained language models. This study illustrates the potential of NLP techniques to improve psychosis detection within admission notes and aims to serve as a foundational reference for future research on applying NLP for psychosis identification in EHR notes."

However, the current standard for real-world data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) for treatment evaluation is manual review (MR), which is time-consuming and laborious. Clinical Data Collector (CDC) is a novel natural language processing and text mining software tool for both structured and unstructured EHR data and only shows relevant EHR sections improving efficiency. We investigated CDC as a real-world data (RWD) collection method, through application of CDC queries for patient inclusion and information extraction on a cohort of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) receiving systemic drug treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and treatment outcomes were extracted and these were compared with MR for validation. One hundred patients receiving 175 treatments were included using CDC, which corresponded to 99% with MR. Calculated median overall survival was 21.7 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-24.8) vs. 21.7 months (95% CI 18.6-24.8) and progression-free survival 8.9 months (95% CI 5.4-12.4) vs. 7.6 months (95% CI 5.7-9.4) for CDC vs. MR, respectively. Highest F1-score was found for cancer-related variables (88.1-100), followed by comorbidities (71.5-90.4) and adverse drug events (53.3-74.5), with most diverse scores on international metastatic RCC database criteria (51.4-100). Mean data collection time was 12 minutes (CDC) vs. 86 minutes (MR). In conclusion, CDC is a promising tool for retrieving RWD from EHRs because the correct patient population can be identified as well as relevant outcome data, such as overall survival and progression-free survival."

Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of epilepsy who visited from May 11, 2019, to May 10, 2020, were screened by the algorithm and assigned surgical candidacy scores. The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC), which was calculated by comparing scores from patients who underwent epilepsy surgery before November 10, 2020, against scores from nonsurgical patients. Nonsurgical patients' charts were reviewed to determine whether patients with high scores were more likely to be missed surgical candidates. Delay to surgery was defined as the time between the first visit that a surgical candidate was identified by the algorithm and the date of the surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 5,285 pediatric and 5,782 adult patients were included to train the ML algorithms. During the study period, 41 children and 23 adults underwent resective epilepsy surgery. In the pediatric cohort, AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94), positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.08 (0.05-0.10), and negative predictive value (NPV) was 1.00 (0.99-1.00). In the adult cohort, AUC was 0.91 (0.86-0.97), PPV was 0.07 (0.04-0.11), and NPV was 1.00 (0.99-1.00). The models first identified patients at a median of 2.1 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.2-4.9 years, maximum: 11.1 years) before their surgery and 1.3 years (IQR: 0.3-4.0 years, maximum: 10.1 years) before their presurgical evaluations.
DISCUSSION: ML algorithms can identify surgical candidates earlier in the disease course. Even at specialized epilepsy centers, there is room to shorten the time to surgery.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that a machine learning algorithm can accurately distinguish patients with epilepsy who require resective surgery from those who do not."

This paper describes a rule-based system developed using a combination of regular expressions, concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and freely-available resources from the community. With a performance (F1=90.7) that is significantly higher than the median (F1=87.20) and close to the top performing system (F1=92.8), it was the best rule-based system of all the submissions in the challenge. We also used this system to evaluate the utility of different terminologies in the UMLS towards the challenge task. Of the 155 terminologies in the UMLS, 129 (76.78%) have no representation in the corpus. The Consumer Health Vocabulary had very good coverage of relevant concepts and was the most useful terminology for the challenge task. While segmenting notes into sections and lists has a significant impact on the performance, identifying negations and experiencer of the medical event results in negligible gain."

Given the limited information on the topic from traditional public health surveillance sources, we studied posts made to an online suicide discussion forum, ""Sanctioned Suicide,"" which is a primary source of information on the use and procurement of SN.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the trends in SN purchase and use, as obtained via data mining from subscriber posts on the forum. We also aim to determine the substances and topics commonly co-occurring with SN, as well as the geographical distribution of users and sources of SN.
METHODS: We collected all publicly available from the site's inception in March 2018 to October 2022. Using data-driven methods, including natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed the trends in SN mentions over time, including the locations of SN consumers and the sources from which SN is procured. We developed a transformer-based source and location classifier to determine the geographical distribution of the sources of SN.
RESULTS: Posts pertaining to SN show a rise in popularity, and there were statistically significant correlations between real-life use of SN and suicidal intent when compared to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (⍴=0.727; P<.001) and the National Poison Data System (⍴=0.866; P=.001). We observed frequent co-mentions of antiemetics, benzodiazepines, and acid regulators with SN. Our proposed machine learning-based source and location classifier can detect potential sources of SN with an accuracy of 72.92% and showed consumption in the United States and elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Vital information about SN and other emerging mechanisms of suicide can be obtained from online forums."

This study aimed to estimate the incidence of GBS in urban China and evaluate the worldwide variation in the incidence of GBS.
METHODS: Firstly, we did a population-based study to calculate the incidence of GBS in urban China based on the National Urban Medical Insurance database from 2013 to 2017. To identify GBS cases, natural language processing was used first for handling the lengthy and unstructured diagnostic information and then checked by prestigious neurologists. Secondly, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to analyze the incidence of GBS worldwide. Up to July 4, 2022, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were retrieved to identify the population-based studies regarding the incidence of GBS. The basic information and the statistics regarding incidence were extracted. Quality assessment considered sample representativeness, condition assessment, and statistical methods.
RESULTS: A total of 1.44 billion person-years in insurance data was covered, with 3,534 GBS cases identified. The annual incidences of GBS in urban China between 2013 and 2017 ranged from 0.41 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.58) to 0.58 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.82) per 100,000 person-years. The incidence was the highest in Northwest China and the lowest in Northeast China. The meta-analysis included 122 articles. The quality assessment showed that the quality scores of 43.3% of studies were ≥ 0.75 (the total score is 1). The global incidence of GBS was 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.27) per 100,000 person-years. The incidences in West Europe, South Asia, and North Europe were higher, while the incidences in Australia and New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and North Africa were lower. The incidence of enteric infections was positively associated with the incidence of GBS (coefficient=0.0000185, P=0.007). The incidence in Europe, Australia, and America rose significantly from 1960 to 2020 (coefficient=0.01, t=2.52, P=0.015).
DISCUSSION: There is a clear regional variation of the GBS incidence at both national and global levels. Careful control of enteric infections should be conducted to reduce the disease burden."

Healthcare associated urinary tract infections (HA-UTI) accounts for about 20-30% of all HAI's, and with the emergence of multi-resistant urinary tract pathogens, the total burden of HA-UTI will most likely increase.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to develop two predictive models, using data from the index admission as well as historic data on a patient, to predict the development of UTI at the time of entry to the hospital and after 48 hours of admission (HA-UTI). The ultimate goal is to predict the individual patient risk of acquiring HA-UTI before it occurs so that health care professionals may take proper actions to prevent it.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of approx. 300 000 adult admissions in a Danish region was performed. We developed models for UTI prediction with five machine-learning algorithms using demographic information, laboratory results, data on antibiotic treatment, past medical history (ICD10 codes), and clinical data by transformation of unstructured narrative text in Electronic Medical Records to structured data by Natural Language Processing.
RESULTS: The five machine-learning algorithms have been evaluated by the performance measures average squared error, cumulative lift, and area under the curve (ROC-index). The algorithms had an area under the curve (ROC-index) ranging from 0.82 to 0.84 for the entry model (T = 0 hours after admission) and from 0.71 to 0.77 for the HA-UTI model (T = 48 hours after admission).
CONCLUSION: The study is proof of concept that it is possible to create machine-learning models that can serve as early warning systems to predict patients at risk of acquiring urinary tract infections during admission. The entry model and the HA-UTI models perform with a high ROC-index indicating a sufficient sensitivity and specificity, which may make both models instrumental in individualized prevention of UTI in hospitalized patients. The favored machine-learning methodology is Decision Trees to ensure the most transparent results and to increase clinical understanding and implementation of the models."

SETTING: A single, private, not-for profit hospital in rural, southwestern Uganda.
PARTICIPANTS: From 2009 to 2015, 26 996 patient visits produced 42 566 total chief complaints for the derivation dataset, and from 2015 to 2017, 10 068 visits produced 20 165 total chief complaints for the validation dataset.
METHODS: A retrospective review of an emergency centre quality assurance database was performed. Data were abstracted, cleaned and refined using language processing in Stata to produce a longlist of chief complaints, which was collapsed via a consensus process to produce a shortlist and turned into a web-based tool. This tool was used by two local Ugandan emergency care practitioners to categorise complaints from a second longlist produced from a separate validation dataset from the same study site. Their agreement on grouping was analysed using Cohen's kappa to determine inter-rater reliability. The chief complaints describing 80% of patient visits from automated and consensus shortlists were combined to form a candidate chief complaint shortlist.
RESULTS: Automated data cleaning and refining recognised 95.8% of all complaints and produced a longlist of 555 chief complaints. The consensus process yielded a shortlist of 83 grouped chief complaints. The second validation dataset was reduced in Stata to a longlist of 451 complaints. Using the shortlist tool to categorise complaints produced 71.5% agreement, yielding a kappa of 0.70 showing substantial inter-rater reliability. Only one complaint did not fit into the shortlist and required a free-text amendment. The two shortlists were identical for the most common 14 complaints and combined to form a candidate list of 24 complaints that could characterise over 80% of all emergency centre chief complaints.
CONCLUSIONS: Shortlists of chief complaints can be generated to improve standardisation of data entry, facilitate research efforts and be employed for paper chart usage."

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at verifying the criterion-related validity of the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Battery - Brazilian version (MTL-BR) by assessing its ability to discriminate between individuals with unilateral brain damage with and without aphasia.
METHODS: The investigation was carried out in a Brazilian community-based sample of 104 adults, divided into four groups: 26 participants with left hemisphere damage (LHD) with aphasia, 25 participants with right hemisphere damage (RHD), 28 with LHD non-aphasic, and 25 healthy adults.
RESULTS: There were significant differences between patients with aphasia and the other groups on most total and subtotal scores on MTL-BR tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed strong criterion-related validity evidence for the MTL-BR Battery, and provided important information regarding hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric cooperation. Future research is required to search for additional evidence of sensitivity, specificity and validity of the MTL-BR in samples with different types of aphasia and degrees of language impairment."

These factors are often studied in qualitative research but ignored in quantitative analyses. However, they provide in-depth insight into the local behavior and may help to improve HIV prevention.
OBJECTIVE: To obtain a comprehensive overview of the sociobehavioral factors influencing HIV prevalence and incidence in Malawi, we systematically reviewed the literature using a newly programmed tool for automatizing part of the systematic review process.
METHODS: Due to the choice of broad search terms (""HIV AND Malawi""), our preliminary search revealed many thousands of articles. We, therefore, developed a Python tool to automatically extract, process, and categorize open-access articles published from January 1, 1987 to October 1, 2019 in the PubMed, PubMed Central, JSTOR, Paperity, and arXiV databases. We then used a topic modelling algorithm to classify and identify publications of interest.
RESULTS: Our tool extracted 22,709 unique articles; 16,942 could be further processed. After topic modelling, 519 of these were clustered into relevant topics, of which 20 were kept after manual screening. We retrieved 7 more publications after examining the references so that 27 publications were finally included in the review. Reducing the 16,942 articles to 519 potentially relevant articles using the software took 5 days. Several factors contributing to the risk of HIV infection were identified, including religion, gender and relationship dynamics, beliefs, and sociobehavioral attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our software does not replace traditional systematic reviews, but it returns useful results to broad queries of open-access literature in under a week, without a priori knowledge. This produces a ""seed dataset"" of relevance that could be further developed. It identified known factors and factors that may be specific to Malawi. In the future, we aim to expand the tool by adding more social science databases and applying it to other sub-Saharan African countries."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a propensity score-matched observational study using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Veterans Affairs (VA) data from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2010, with a mean follow-up time of 4.7 years (range, 0-10 years). Men receiving VA primary care aged 65 to 99 years without a previous fracture (N=2,539,812) were included. Men undergoing DXA testing were propensity score matched with untested controls in a 1:3 ratio, indicating the probability of DXA testing within the next year. Time to first clinical fracture was the primary outcome. Comorbidities, demographic characteristics, medications, DXA results, and osteoporosis treatment were defined using administrative data and natural language processing. A landmark analysis contingent on surviving to 12 months after screening was completed, accounting for competing risk of mortality.
RESULTS: During follow-up of 153,311 men tested by DXA and 390,158 controls, 56,083 (10.3%) had sustained a fracture and 111,774 (20.6%) died. Overall, DXA testing was not associated with a decrease in fractures; conclusions are limited by unmeasured confounders and low medication initiation and adherence in those meeting treatment thresholds (12% of follow-up time). In contrast, DXA testing in prespecified subgroups was associated with a lower risk of fracture in comparison to the overall population who underwent DXA testing: androgen deprivation therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.89), glucocorticoids (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84), age 80 years and older (HR, 0.85; 0.81-0.90), 1 or more VA guideline risk factors (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.95), and high Fracture Risk Assessment Tool using body mass index score (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95).
CONCLUSION: Current VA DXA testing practices are ineffective overall; interventions to improve treatment adherence are needed. Targeted DXA testing in higher-risk men was associated with a lower fracture risk."

Epub 2023 Oct 17.,Maki S,J Surg Res,2024,2023/10/19,,,10.1016/j.jss.2023.09.041,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have reported significant associations between personality scales of broadband psychometric testing to bariatric surgical outcomes; however, the literature falls short in outlining how these instruments can be best utilized to optimize weight loss milestones after surgery. The purpose of this scoping review is to analyze the literature utilizing broadband personality tests in the bariatric surgical population with relation to weight loss outcomes to identify gaps in research and summarize results to guide American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery practices and future research.
METHODS: Six databases were searched for broadband personality assessments, bariatric surgery, and weight loss outcomes terms. Studies included were peer-reviewed, published in English, and compared psychological assessments and weight loss outcomes.
RESULTS: Five hundred nineteen studies were reviewed, with 20 included in the full-text analysis. Studies used at least one of six defined broadband personality assessments. Elevated scores for depression were associated with lower weight loss with three of the assessments. Anxiety was inconsistently associated with postoperative weight loss, but this may be dependent on follow-up time CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative broadband personality assessments may support identifying behaviors that help patients reach their postoperative weight loss goals. Inconsistencies in the reporting of weight loss outcome measures across the literature make it difficult to draw significant conclusions. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery recommends standardization of outcome reporting, further highlighting a need in research to identify scales that are consistent predictors of weight loss outcomes."

Genetic and other biological variables may contribute to PCS etiology, and the emergence of biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) offers new opportunities for research on PCS. We sought to validate the EHR data of PCS patients by comparing two diagnostic algorithms deployed in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center de-identified database of 2.8 million patient EHRs. The algorithms identified individuals with PCS by: 1) natural language processing (NLP) of narrative text in the EHR combined with structured demographic, diagnostic, and encounter data; or 2) coded billing and procedure data. The predictive value of each algorithm was assessed, and cases and controls identified by each approach were compared on demographic and medical characteristics. The NLP algorithm identified 507 cases and 10,857 controls. The negative predictive value in controls was 78% and the positive predictive value (PPV) in cases was 82%. Conversely, the coded algorithm identified 1142 patients with two or more PCS billing codes and had a PPV of 76%. Comparisons of PCS controls to both case groups recovered known epidemiology of PCS: cases were more likely than controls to be female and to have pre-morbid diagnoses of anxiety, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In contrast, controls and cases were equally likely to have attention deficit hyperactive disorder and learning disabilities, in accordance with the findings of recent systematic reviews of PCS risk factors. We conclude that EHRs are a valuable research tool for PCS. Ascertainment based on coded data alone had a predictive value comparable to an NLP algorithm, recovered known PCS risk factors, and maximized the number of included patients."

This systematic review maps all contemporary evidence regarding interventions aiming to promote return-to-work in survivors of ischaemic stroke. We performed a search according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines and searched five reference databases. Prospective trial registers and grey literature were also assessed, and we executed backwards and forward reference searching. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017077796). The search yielded 444 records of which 174 were duplicates. Backward and forward reference searching resulted in 808 unique records. Eleven articles were retained for full-text analysis and two met the selection criteria. A controlled before-after study showed beneficial effects of intravenous thrombolytic treatment in patients with moderate to severe acute ischaemic stroke. A retrospective study with low methodological quality reported improved vocational outcome of an outpatient rehabilitation program in patients with mild to moderate ischaemic stroke. We conclude that there currently is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to promote return-to-work in patients with ischaemic stroke, though intravenous thrombolytic therapy has shown beneficial effects and there are indications that rehabilitation programs may also be advantageous."

The objective was to prospectively validate a natural language processing (NLP) application that uses provider notes to assign epilepsy surgery candidacy scores.
METHODS: The application was trained on notes from (1) patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and a history of resective epilepsy surgery and (2) patients who were seizure-free without surgery. The testing set included all patients with unknown surgical candidacy status and an upcoming neurology visit. Training and testing sets were updated weekly for 1 year. One- to three-word phrases contained in patients' notes were used as features. Patients prospectively identified by the application as candidates for surgery were manually reviewed by two epileptologists. Performance metrics were defined by comparing NLP-derived surgical candidacy scores with surgical candidacy status from expert chart review.
RESULTS: The training set was updated weekly and included notes from a mean of 519 ± 67 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 10-fold cross-validation was 0.90 ± 0.04 (range = 0.83-0.96) and improved by 0.002 per week (P < .001) as new patients were added to the training set. Of the 6395 patients who visited the neurology clinic, 4211 (67%) were evaluated by the model. The prospective AUC on this test set was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-0.96). Using the optimal surgical candidacy score threshold, sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI = 0.29-0.99), specificity was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.64-0.88), positive predictive value was 0.25 (95% CI = 0.07-0.52), and negative predictive value was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.87-1.00). The number needed to screen was 5.6.
SIGNIFICANCE: An electronic health record-integrated NLP application can accurately assign surgical candidacy scores to patients in a clinical setting."

37236305,Chronic liver disease-associated severe thrombocytopenia in Spain: Results from a retrospective study using machine learning and natural language processing,"Calleja-Panero JL, Esteban Mur R, Jarque I, Romero-Gómez M, Group SR, García Labrador L, González Calvo J.",Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2024 Mar;47(3):236-245. doi: 10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.05.010. Epub 2023 May 24.,Calleja-Panero JL,Gastroenterol Hepatol,2024,2023/05/26,,,10.1016/j.gastrohep.2023.05.010,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) often develop thrombocytopenia (TCP) as a complication. Severe TCP (platelet count&lt;50×109/L) can increase morbidity and complicate CLD management, increasing bleeding risk during invasive procedures.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the real-world scenario of CLD-associated severe TCP patients' clinical characteristics. To evaluate the association between invasive procedures, prophylactic treatments, and bleeding events in this group of patients. To describe their need of medical resource use in Spain.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter study including patients who had confirmed diagnosis of CLD and severe TCP in four hospitals within the Spanish National Healthcare Network from January 2014 to December 2018. We analyzed the free-text information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of patients using Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning techniques, and SNOMED-CT terminology. Demographics, comorbidities, analytical parameters and characteristics of CLD were extracted at baseline and need for invasive procedures, prophylactic treatments, bleeding events and medical resources used in the follow up period. Frequency tables were generated for categorical variables, whereas continuous variables were described in summary tables as mean (SD) and median (Q1-Q3).
RESULTS: Out of 1,765,675 patients, 1787 had CLD and severe TCP; 65.2% were male with a mean age of 54.7 years old. Cirrhosis was detected in 46% (n=820) of patients and 9.1% (n=163) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Invasive procedures were needed in 85.6% of patients during the follow up period. Patients undergoing procedures compared to those patients without invasive procedures presented higher rates of bleeding events (33% vs 8%, p<0.0001) and higher number of bleedings. While prophylactic platelet transfusions were given to 25.6% of patients undergoing procedures, TPO receptor agonist use was only detected in 3.1% of them. Most patients (60.9%) required at least one hospital admission during the follow up and 14.4% of admissions were due to bleeding events with a hospital length of stay of 6 (3, 9) days.
CONCLUSIONS: NLP and machine learning are useful tools to describe real-world data in patients with CLD and severe TCP in Spain. Bleeding events are frequent in those patients who need invasive procedures, even receiving platelet transfusions as a prophylactic treatment, increasing the further use of medical resources. Because that, new prophylactic treatments that are not yet generalized, are needed."

SAMPLE: Bereaved dog owners who participated in the refinement, face validity assessment, or reliability assessment of the EOLS (n=42) and/or completed the entire survey between January 20 and March 24, 2021 (n=646).
PROCEDURES: The EOLS was created and modified by veterinary health professionals and human gerontology experts using published literature, clinical veterinary experience, previously created DAP surveys, and feedback from a pilot study conducted with bereaved dog owners. The EOLS was subjected to qualitative validation methods and post-hoc free-text analysis to evaluate its ability to thoroughly capture scientifically relevant aspects of companion dogs' death.
RESULTS: The EOLS was well-received with excellent face validity as assessed by dog owners and experts. The EOLS had fair to substantial reliability for the three validation themes: cause of death (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI [0.5-0.95]), perimortem quality of life (kappa = 0.49; 95% CI [0.26-0.73]), and reason for euthanasia (kappa = 0.3; 95% CI [0.08-0.52]) and had no need for any substantial content alterations based on free-text analysis.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The EOLS has proven to be a well-accepted, comprehensive, and valid instrument for capturing owner-reported companion dog mortality data and has the potential to enhance veterinarians' ability to care for the aging dog population by illuminating their understanding of companion dogs' end-of-life experiences."
36764726,Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and social media on the behaviour of pregnant and lactating women towards vaccination: a scoping review,"De Brabandere L, Hendrickx G, Poels K, Daelemans W, Van Damme P, Maertens K.",BMJ Open. 2023 Feb 10;13(2):e066367. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066367.,De Brabandere L,BMJ Open,2023,2023/02/10,PMC9922880,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066367,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women, foetuses and infants are at risk of infectious disease-related complications. Maternal vaccination is a strategy developed to better protect pregnant women and their offspring against infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccines against influenza, pertussis and recently also COVID-19 are widely recommended for pregnant women. Yet, there is still a significant amount of hesitation towards maternal vaccination policies. Furthermore, contradictory messages circulating social media impact vaccine confidence.
OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aims to reveal how COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination impacted vaccine confidence in pregnant and lactating women. Additionally, this review studied the role social media plays in creating opinions towards vaccination in these target groups.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles published between 23 November 2018 and 18 July 2022 that are linked to the objectives of this review were included. Reviews, articles not focusing on the target group, abstracts, articles describing outcomes of COVID-19 infection/COVID-19 vaccination were excluded.
SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: The PubMed database was searched to select articles. Search terms used were linked to pregnancy, lactation, vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, COVID-19 and social media.
CHARTING METHODS: Included articles were abstracted and synthesised by one reviewer. Verification was done by a second reviewer. Disagreements were addressed through discussion between reviewers and other researchers.
RESULTS: Pregnant and lactating women are generally less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared with non-pregnant and non-nursing women. The main reason to refuse maternal vaccination is safety concerns. A positive link was detected between COVID-19 vaccine willingness and acceptance of other vaccines during pregnancy. The internet and social media are identified as important information sources for maternal vaccination.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy in pregnant and lactating women remains an important issue, expressing the need for effective interventions to increase vaccine confidence and coverage. The role social media plays in vaccine uptake remains unclear."
29869360,"Spectrum of illness among returned Australian travellers from Bali, Indonesia: a 5-year retrospective observational study","Sohail A, McGuinness SL, Lightowler R, Leder K, Jomon B, Bain CA, Peleg AY.",Intern Med J. 2019 Jan;49(1):34-40. doi: 10.1111/imj.13993.,Sohail A,Intern Med J,2019,2018/06/06,,,10.1111/imj.13993,"BACKGROUND: Bali, Indonesia, presents significant infectious and non-infectious health risks for Australian travellers. Understanding this spectrum of illnesses has the potential to assist clinicians in evaluating unwell returning travellers and guide provision of pre-travel advice.
AIM: To describe the spectrum of illnesses seen in returned travellers from Bali.
METHODS: Using a novel text mining approach, we performed a retrospective, observational study of all adult emergency department presentations to a metropolitan health service in Melbourne, from 2011 to 2015. Outcome measures included demographic, clinical and laboratory features of travel-related illnesses.
RESULTS: A total of 464 patients met inclusion criteria. Gastroenteritis (119/464, 26%), systemic febrile illness (88/464, 19%) and respiratory tract infection (51/464, 11%) were the most common diagnoses. Dengue was the most common laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (25/464, 5%). No cases of malaria were identified. Common non-infectious presentations included traumatic injury (47/464, 10%) and animal bites requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (29/464, 6%). A total of 110 patients (24%) was admitted to the hospital; those presenting with systemic febrile illness were more likely to be admitted compared to those presenting with other illnesses (odds ratio 3.42, 95% confidence interval 2.02-5.75, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use a text mining approach to identify and describe emergency department presentations related to diseases acquired in Bali by Australian travellers. Although infections are important causes of illness, trauma and animal bites account for a significant number of hospital presentations. Our findings contribute to the knowledge on the health risks for travellers to Bali, and will assist clinicians in relevant pre- and post-travel evaluations."

RESEARCH QUESTION: To identify distinct phenotypic clusters of patients with COPD using objective sleep parameters and evaluate the associations between clusters and all-cause mortality to inform risk stratification.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A longitudinal observational cohort study using nationwide Veterans Health Administration data of patients with COPD investigated for sleep disorders. Sleep parameters were extracted from polysomnography physician interpretation using a validated natural language processing algorithm. We performed cluster analysis using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (K-means) and examined the association between clusters and mortality using Cox regression analysis, adjusted for potential confounders, and visualized with Kaplan-Meier estimates.
RESULTS: Among 9992 patients with COPD and a clinically indicated baseline polysomnogram, we identified five distinct clusters based on age, comorbidity burden and sleep parameters. Overall mortality increased from 9.4 % to 42 % and short-term mortality (<5.3 years) ranged from 3.4 % to 24.3 % in Cluster 1 to 5. In Cluster 1 younger age, in 5 high comorbidity burden and in the other three clusters, total sleep time and sleep efficiency had significant associations with mortality.
INTERPRETATION: We identified five distinct clinical clusters and highlighted the significant association between total sleep time and sleep efficiency on mortality. The identified clusters highlight the importance of objective sleep parameters in determining mortality risk and phenotypic characterization in this population."
32772573,Left Ventricular Mass Index Is Associated With Cognitive Function in Middle-Age: Bogalusa Heart Study,"Razavi AC, Fernandez C, He J, Kelly TN, Krousel-Wood M, Whelton SP, Carmichael OT, Bazzano LA.",Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2020 Aug;13(8):e010335. doi: 10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.119.010335.

We sought to assess the potential mediation effect of left ventricular (LV) remodeling on the association between lifetime systolic blood pressure and cognitive function in a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults.
METHODS: Nine hundred sixty participants of the Bogalusa Heart Study (59.2% women, 33.8% black, aged 48.4±5.1 years) received 2-dimensional echocardiography to quantify relative wall thickness, LV mass, and diastolic and systolic LV function; and a standardized neurocognitive battery to assess memory, executive functioning, and language processing. Multivariable linear regression assessed the association of cardiac structure and function with a global composite cognitive function score, adjusting for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Mediation analysis assessed the effect of LV mass index on the association between lifetime systolic blood pressure burden and cognitive function.
RESULTS: There were 233 (24.3%) and 136 (14.2%) individuals with concentric LV remodeling and concentric LV hypertrophy, respectively. Each g/m2.7 increment in LV mass index was associated with a 0.03 standardized unit decrement in global cognitive function (P=0.03). Individuals with concentric LV remodeling and isolated diastolic dysfunction had the poorest cognitive function, and a greater ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') was associated with poorer cognitive function, even after adjustment for LV mass index (B=-0.12; P=0.03). A total of 18.8% of the association between lifetime systolic blood pressure burden and midlife cognitive function was accounted for by LV mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac remodeling partially mediates the association between lifespan systolic blood pressure burden and adult cognition in individuals without dementia or clinical cardiovascular disease. Slowing or reversing the progression of cardiac remodeling in middle-age may be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent cognitive decline."

Epub 2015 May 8.,Bellows BK,Int J Eat Disord,2015,2015/05/12,,,10.1002/eat.22427,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the one-year healthcare costs and utilization of patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) to patients with eating disorder not otherwise specified without BED (EDNOS-only) and to matched patients without an eating disorder (NED).
METHODS: A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm identified adults with BED from clinical notes in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record database from 2000 to 2011. Patients with EDNOS-only were identified using ICD-9 code (307.50) and those with NLP-identified BED were excluded. First diagnosis date defined the index date for both groups. Patients with NED were randomly matched 4:1, as available, to patients with BED on age, sex, BMI, depression diagnosis, and index month. Patients with cost data (2005-2011) were included. Total healthcare, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs were examined. Generalized linear models were used to compare total one-year healthcare costs while adjusting for baseline patient characteristics.
RESULTS: There were 257 BED, 743 EDNOS-only, and 823 matched NED patients identified. The mean (SD) total unadjusted one-year costs, in 2011 US dollars, were $33,716 ($38,928) for BED, $37,052 ($40,719) for EDNOS-only, and $19,548 ($35,780) for NED patients. When adjusting for patient characteristics, BED patients had one-year total healthcare costs $5,589 higher than EDNOS-only (p = 0.06) and $18,152 higher than matched NED patients (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: This study is the first to use NLP to identify BED patients and quantify their healthcare costs and utilization. Patients with BED had similar one-year total healthcare costs to EDNOS-only patients, but significantly higher costs than patients with NED."

DESIGN: Observational study with exploratory mediation analysis.
SETTING: Anonymised electronic mental health record data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.
PARTICIPANTS: 2026 people presenting to early intervention services with FEP.
EXPOSURE: Cannabis use at presentation, identified using natural language processing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: admission to psychiatric hospital and clozapine prescription up to 5 years following presentation.
MEDIATOR: Number of unique antipsychotics prescribed.
RESULTS: Cannabis use was present in 46.3% of the sample at first presentation and was particularly common in patients who were 16-25, male and single. It was associated with increased frequency of hospital admission (incidence rate ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.80), increased likelihood of compulsory admission (OR 1.55, 1.16 to 2.08) and greater number of days spent in hospital (β coefficient 35.1 days, 12.1 to 58.1). The number of unique antipsychotics prescribed, mediated increased frequency of hospital admission (natural indirect effect 1.09, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; total effect 1.50, 1.21 to 1.87), increased likelihood of compulsory admission (natural indirect effect (NIE) 1.27, 1.03 to 1.58; total effect (TE) 1.76, 0.81 to 3.84) and greater number of days spent in hospital (NIE 17.9, 2.4 to 33.4; TE 34.8, 11.6 to 58.1).
CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use in patients with FEP was associated with an increased likelihood of hospital admission. This was linked to the prescription of several different antipsychotic drugs, indicating clinical judgement of antipsychotic treatment failure. Together, this suggests that cannabis use might be associated with worse clinical outcomes in psychosis by contributing towards failure of antipsychotic treatment."
26096383,Relationship Between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cognitive Change in a Multiethnic Elderly Cohort,"Bangen KJ, Gu Y, Gross AL, Schneider BC, Skinner JC, Benitez A, Sachs BC, Shih R, Sisco S, Schupf N, Mayeux R, Manly JJ, Luchsinger JA.",J Am Geriatr Soc. 2015 Jun;63(6):1075-83. doi: 10.1111/jgs.13441.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, a community-based, prospective study of risk factors for dementia in northern Manhattan, New York City.
PARTICIPANTS: Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white men and women aged 65 and older without dementia at baseline (N = 1,493).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants underwent baseline and follow-up cognitive and health assessments approximately every 18 months. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the longitudinal association between diabetes mellitus and cognition.
RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was associated with poorer baseline cognitive performance in memory, language, processing speed and executive functioning, and visuospatial abilities. After adjusting for age, education, sex, race and ethnicity, and apolipoprotein-ε4, participants with diabetes mellitus performed significantly worse at baseline than those without in language and visuospatial abilities. There were no differences between those with and without diabetes mellitus in terms of rate of cognitive change over a mean follow-up time of 6 years.
CONCLUSION: The rate of cognitive change in elderly persons with and without diabetes mellitus is similar, although cognitive performance is poorer in persons with diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest that cognitive changes may occur early during the diabetes mellitus process and highlight the need for studies to follow participants beginning at least in midlife, before the typical later-life onset of dementia."

As artificial intelligence-driven conversational agents, chatbots offer the opportunity to revolutionize history-taking, necessitating a comprehensive examination of their impact on medical practice.
OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the role, effectiveness, usability, and patient acceptance of chatbots in medical history-taking. It also examines potential challenges and future opportunities for integration into clinical practice.
METHODS: A systematic search included PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE (via Ovid), CENTRAL, Scopus, and Open Science and covered studies through July 2024. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies reviewed were based on the PICOS (participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and study design) framework. The population included individuals using health care chatbots for medical history-taking. Interventions focused on chatbots designed to facilitate medical history-taking. The outcomes of interest were the feasibility, acceptance, and usability of chatbot-based medical history-taking. Studies not reporting on these outcomes were excluded. All study designs except conference papers were eligible for inclusion. Only English-language studies were considered. There were no specific restrictions on study duration. Key search terms included ""chatbot*,"" ""conversational agent*,"" ""virtual assistant,"" ""artificial intelligence chatbot,"" ""medical history,"" and ""history-taking."" The quality of observational studies was classified using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) criteria (eg, sample size, design, data collection, and follow-up). The RoB 2 (Risk of Bias) tool assessed areas and the levels of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
RESULTS: The review included 15 observational studies and 3 RCTs and synthesized evidence from different medical fields and populations. Chatbots systematically collect information through targeted queries and data retrieval, improving patient engagement and satisfaction. The results show that chatbots have great potential for history-taking and that the efficiency and accessibility of the health care system can be improved by 24/7 automated data collection. Bias assessments revealed that of the 15 observational studies, 5 (33%) studies were of high quality, 5 (33%) studies were of moderate quality, and 5 (33%) studies were of low quality. Of the RCTs, 2 had a low risk of bias, while 1 had a high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides critical insights into the potential benefits and challenges of using chatbots for medical history-taking. The included studies showed that chatbots can increase patient engagement, streamline data collection, and improve health care decision-making. For effective integration into clinical practice, it is crucial to design user-friendly interfaces, ensure robust data security, and maintain empathetic patient-physician interactions. Future research should focus on refining chatbot algorithms, improving their emotional intelligence, and extending their application to different health care settings to realize their full potential in modern medicine.

DESIGN: Algorithm development and validation study. To classify consultations, the algorithm is designed to interrogate clinical narrative entered as free text, diagnostic (Read) codes created and medications prescribed on the day of the consultation.
SETTING: Thirty-six consenting primary care practices from a mixed urban and semirural region of New Zealand. Three independent sets of 1200 child consultation records were randomly extracted from a data set of all general practitioner consultations in participating practices between 1 January 2008-31 December 2013 for children under 18 years of age (n=754,242). Each consultation record within these sets was independently classified by two expert clinicians as respiratory or non-respiratory, and subclassified according to respiratory diagnostic categories to create three 'gold standard' sets of classified records. These three gold standard record sets were used to train, test and validate the algorithm.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and F-measure were calculated to illustrate the algorithm's ability to replicate judgements of expert clinicians within the 1200 record gold standard validation set.
RESULTS: The algorithm was able to identify respiratory consultations in the 1200 record validation set with a sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.78) and a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.98). The positive predictive value of algorithm respiratory classification was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.97). The positive predictive value of the algorithm classifying consultations as being related to specific respiratory diagnostic categories ranged from 0.68 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.00; other respiratory conditions) to 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; throat infections).
CONCLUSIONS: A software inference algorithm that uses primary care Big Data can accurately classify the content of clinical consultations. This algorithm will enable accurate estimation of the prevalence of childhood respiratory illness in primary care and resultant service utilisation. The methodology can also be applied to other areas of clinical care."

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,Sufriyana H,EBioMedicine,2020,2020/04/14,PMC7152721,,10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102710,"BACKGROUND: We developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of preeclampsia applied to a nationwide health insurance dataset in Indonesia.
METHODS: The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing techniques to interpret our modeling results.
FINDINGS: The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a random forest algorithm. Nine∼12 months to the event was the period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either geographical (0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal split (0.86, 95% CI 0.85-0.86). We compared this model to prediction models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS. This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision, sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets.

METHODS: We used the national Veterans Affairs EMR to curate a cohort of HFpEF patients from 2002 to 2014. EF values were extracted from clinical documents utilizing natural language processing and an iterative approach was used to refine the algorithm for verification of clinical HFpEF. The final algorithm utilized the following inclusion criteria: any International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) code of HF (428.xx); all recorded EF ≥50%; and either B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or aminoterminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) values recorded OR diuretic use within one month of diagnosis of HF. Validation of the algorithm was performed by 3 independent reviewers doing manual chart review of 100 HFpEF cases and 100 controls.
RESULTS: We established a HFpEF cohort of 80,248 patients (out of a total 1,155,376 patients with the ICD-9 diagnosis of HF). Mean age was 72 years; 96% were males and 12% were African-Americans. Validation analysis of the HFpEF algorithm had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 96%, positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 87% to identify HFpEF cases.
CONCLUSION: We developed a sensitive, highly specific algorithm for detecting HFpEF in a large national database. This approach may be applicable to other large EMR databases to identify HFpEF patients."

METHODS: We searched PubMed using keywords ""SDOH"" and ""EHR"", underwent title/abstract and full-text screening. Included records were analyzed under five domains: 1) SDoH screening and assessment approaches, 2) SDoH data collection and documentation, 3) Use of natural language processing (NLP) for extracting SDoH, 4) SDoH data and health outcomes, and 5) SDoH-driven interventions.
RESULTS: We identified 685 articles, of which 324 underwent full review. Key findings include tailored screening instruments implemented across settings, census and claims data linkage providing contextual SDoH profiles, rule-based and neural network systems extracting SDoH from notes using NLP, connections found between SDoH data and healthcare utilization/chronic disease control, and integrated care management programs executed. However, considerable variability persists across data sources, tools, and outcomes.
DISCUSSION: Despite progress identifying patient social needs, further development of standards, predictive models, and coordinated interventions is critical to fulfill the potential of SDoH-EHR integration. Additional database searches could strengthen this scoping review. Ultimately widespread capture, analysis, and translation of multidimensional SDoH data into clinical care is essential for promoting health equity."

However, most digital data in healthcare are in an unstructured and often not readily accessible format for research. Unstructured data are often found in a format that lacks standardization and needs significant preprocessing and feature extraction efforts. This poses challenges when combining such data with other data sources to enhance the existing knowledge base, which we refer to as digital unstructured data enrichment. Overcoming these methodological challenges requires significant resources and may limit the ability to fully leverage their potential for advancing health research and, ultimately, prevention, and patient care delivery. While prevalent challenges associated with unstructured data use in health research are widely reported across literature, a comprehensive interdisciplinary summary of such challenges and possible solutions to facilitate their use in combination with structured data sources is missing. In this study, we report findings from a systematic narrative review on the seven most prevalent challenge areas connected with the digital unstructured data enrichment in the fields of cardiology, neurology and mental health, along with possible solutions to address these challenges. Based on these findings, we developed a checklist that follows the standard data flow in health research studies. This checklist aims to provide initial systematic guidance to inform early planning and feasibility assessments for health research studies aiming combining unstructured data with existing data sources. Overall, the generality of reported unstructured data enrichment methods in the studies included in this review call for more systematic reporting of such methods to achieve greater reproducibility in future studies."

Surgical/transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a Class I recommendation, but it is unclear if this recommendation is uniformly applied. We determined the impact of managing cardiologists on the likelihood of ssAS treatment. Methods and Results Using natural language processing of Optum electronic health records, we identified 26 438 patients with newly diagnosed ssAS (2011-2016). Multilevel, multivariable Fine-Gray competing risk models clustered by cardiologists were used to determine the impact of cardiologists on the likelihood of 1-year AVR treatment. Within 1 year of diagnosis, 35.6% of patients with ssAS received an AVR; however, rates varied widely among managing cardiologists (0%, lowest quartile; 100%, highest quartile [median, 29.6%; 25th-75th percentiles, 13.3%-47.0%]). The odds of receiving AVR varied >2-fold depending on the cardiologist (median odds ratio for AVR, 2.25; 95% CI, 2.14-2.36). Compared with patients with ssAS of cardiologists with the highest treatment rates, those treated by cardiologists with the lowest AVR rates experienced significantly higher 1-year mortality (lowest quartile, adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22, 95% CI, 1.13-1.33). Conclusions Overall AVR rates for ssAS were low, highlighting a potential challenge for ssAS management in the United States. Cardiologist AVR use varied substantially; patients treated by cardiologists with lower AVR rates had higher mortality rates than those treated by cardiologists with higher AVR rates."

Automating the identification of potential surgical candidates may facilitate earlier intervention. Our objective was to develop site-specific machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify candidates before they undergo surgery.
MATERIALS & METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, ML algorithms were trained on n-grams extracted from free-text neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, visit codes, medications, procedures, laboratories, and demographic information. Site-specific algorithms were developed at two epilepsy centers: one pediatric and one adult. Cases were defined as patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and controls were patients with epilepsy with no history of surgery. The output of the ML algorithms was the estimated likelihood of candidacy for resective epilepsy surgery. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: There were 5880 children (n = 137 had surgery [2.3%]) and 7604 adults with epilepsy (n = 56 had surgery [0.7%]) included in the study. Pediatric surgical patients could be identified 2.0 years (range: 0-8.6 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) and PR-AUC =0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.18). Adult surgical patients could be identified 1.0 year (range: 0-5.4 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.93) and PR-AUC =0.31 (95% CI: 0.14-0.48). By the time patients began their presurgical evaluation, the ML algorithms identified pediatric and adult surgical patients with AUC =0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The mean squared error of the predicted probability of surgical candidacy (Brier scores) was 0.018 in pediatrics and 0.006 in adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Site-specific machine learning algorithms can identify candidates for epilepsy surgery early in the disease course in diverse practice settings."

Epub 2021 Jan 15.,Anthony MS,Am J Obstet Gynecol,2021,2021/01/18,,,10.1016/j.ajog.2021.01.003,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine devices are effective and safe, long-acting reversible contraceptives, but the risk of uterine perforation occurs with an estimated incidence of 1 to 2 per 1000 insertions. The European Active Surveillance Study for Intrauterine Devices, a European prospective observational study that enrolled 61,448 participants (2006-2012), found that women breastfeeding at the time of device insertion or with the device inserted at ≤36 weeks after delivery had a higher risk of uterine perforation. The Association of Uterine Perforation and Expulsion of Intrauterine Device (APEX-IUD) study was a Food and Drug Administration-mandated study designed to reflect current United States clinical practice. The aims of the APEX-IUD study were to evaluate the risk of intrauterine device-related uterine perforation and device expulsion among women who were breastfeeding or within 12 months after delivery at insertion.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the APEX-IUD study design, methodology, and analytical plan and present population characteristics, size of risk factor groups, and duration of follow-up.
STUDY DESIGN: APEX-IUD study was a retrospective cohort study conducted in 4 organizations with access to electronic health records: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Kaiser Permanente Washington, and Regenstrief Institute in Indiana. Variables were identified through structured data (eg, diagnostic, procedural, medication codes) and unstructured data (eg, clinical notes) via natural language processing. Outcomes include uterine perforation and device expulsion; potential risk factors were breastfeeding at insertion, postpartum timing of insertion, device type, and menorrhagia diagnosis in the year before insertion. Covariates include demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and procedure-related variables, such as difficult insertion. The first potential date of inclusion for eligible women varies by research site (from January 1, 2001 to January 1, 2010). Follow-up begins at insertion and ends at first occurrence of an outcome of interest, a censoring event (device removal or reinsertion, pregnancy, hysterectomy, sterilization, device expiration, death, disenrollment, last clinical encounter), or end of the study period (June 30, 2018). Comparisons of levels of exposure variables were made using Cox regression models with confounding adjusted by propensity score weighting using overlap weights.
RESULTS: The study population includes 326,658 women with at least 1 device insertion during the study period (Kaiser Permanente Northern California, 161,442; Kaiser Permanente Southern California, 123,214; Kaiser Permanente Washington, 20,526; Regenstrief Institute, 21,476). The median duration of continuous enrollment was 90 (site medians 74-177) months. The mean age was 32 years, and the population was racially and ethnically diverse across the 4 sites. The mean body mass index was 28.5 kg/m2, and of the women included in the study, 10.0% had menorrhagia ≤12 months before insertion, 5.3% had uterine fibroids, and 10% were recent smokers; furthermore, among these women, 79.4% had levonorgestrel-releasing devices, and 19.5% had copper devices. Across sites, 97,824 women had an intrauterine device insertion at ≤52 weeks after delivery, of which 94,817 women (97%) had breastfeeding status at insertion determined; in addition, 228,834 women had intrauterine device insertion at &gt;52 weeks after delivery or no evidence of a delivery in their health record.
CONCLUSION: Combining retrospective data from multiple sites allowed for a large and diverse study population. Collaboration with clinicians in the study design and validation of outcomes ensured that the APEX-IUD study results reflect current United States clinical practice. Results from this study will provide valuable information based on real-world evidence about risk factors for intrauterine devices perforation and expulsion for clinicians."
34298499,Determinants of Shielding Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Associations With Well-being Among National Health Service Patients: Longitudinal Observational Study,"Bachtiger P, Adamson A, Maclean WA, Kelshiker MA, Quint JK, Peters NS.",JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2021 Sep 20;7(9):e30460. doi: 10.2196/30460.,Bachtiger P,JMIR Public Health Surveill,2021,2021/07/23,PMC8454693,,10.2196/30460,"BACKGROUND: The UK National Health Service (NHS) classified 2.2 million people as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, advising them to ""shield"" (to not leave home for any reason).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the determinants of shielding behavior and associations with well-being in a large NHS patient population for informing future health policy.
METHODS: Patients contributing to an ongoing longitudinal participatory epidemiology study (Longitudinal Effects on Wellbeing of the COVID-19 Pandemic [LoC-19], n=42,924) received weekly email invitations to complete questionnaires (17-week shielding period starting April 9, 2020) within their NHS personal electronic health record. Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised.
RESULTS: The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded.
CONCLUSIONS: Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios."

A more complete understanding of the immunological mechanisms and pharmacodynamics of ICI in cancer patients will help identify the patients most likely to benefit and will generate knowledge for the development of next-generation ICI regimens. We set out to interrogate the early temporal evolution of T cell populations from longitudinal single-cell flow cytometry data. We developed an innovative statistical and computational approach using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that extends the concept of topic modeling used in text mining. This powerful unsupervised learning tool allows us to discover compositional topics within immune cell populations that have distinct functional and differentiation states and are biologically and clinically relevant. To illustrate the model's utility, we analyzed ∼17 million T cells obtained from 138 pre- and on-treatment peripheral blood samples from a cohort of melanoma patients treated with ICIs. We identified three latent dynamic topics: a T-cell exhaustion topic that recapitulates a LAG3+ predominant patient subgroup with poor clinical outcome; a naive topic that shows association with immune-related toxicity; and an immune activation topic that emerges upon ICI treatment. We identified that a patient subgroup with a high baseline of the naïve topic has a higher toxicity grade. While the current application is demonstrated using flow cytometry data, our approach has broader utility and creates a new direction for translating single-cell data into biological and clinical insights."

DESIGN: Observational data extracted from clinical records using natural language processing and Hospital Episode Statistics. Statistical analyses examined effects of cognition, physical health, mental health, sociodemographic factors and living circumstances on risk of admission to care home or hospital over 6 months and associated costs, adjusting for repeated observations.
SETTING: Catchment area for South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, provider for 1.2 million people in Southeast London.
PARTICIPANTS: Every individual with diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease seen and treated by mental health services in the catchment area, with at least one rating of cognition, not resident in care home at time of assessment (n=3075).
INTERVENTIONS: Usual treatment.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of admission to, and days spent in three settings during 6-month period following routine clinical assessment: care home, mental health inpatient care and general hospital inpatient care.
RESULTS: Predictors of probability of care home or hospital admission and/or associated costs over 6 months include cognition, functional problems, agitation, depression, physical illness, previous hospitalisations, age, gender, ethnicity, living alone and having a partner. Patterns of association differed considerably by destination.
CONCLUSIONS: Most people with dementia prefer to remain in their own homes, and funding bodies see this as cheaper than institutionalisation. Better treatment in the community that reduces health and social care needs of Alzheimer's patients would reduce admission rates. Living alone, poor living circumstances and functional problems all raise admission rates, and so major cuts in social care budgets increase the risk of high-cost admissions which older people do not want. Routinely collected data can be used to reveal local patterns of admission and costs."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the incidence of AF in patients admitted for ACS and to evaluate its association with adverse outcomes, given the recent advances in management of both diseases.
METHODS: Natural language processing search algorithms identified AF in patients admitted with ACS across 13 Northwell Health Hospitals from 2015 to 2021. Hierarchical generalized linear mixed modeling was used to assess the association between AF and in-hospital mortality, bleeding, and stroke outcomes; marginal Cox regression modeling was used to assess the association between AF and postdischarge mortality.
RESULTS: Of 12,315 patients admitted for ACS, 3018 (24.5%) had AF with 1609 (53.3%) newly diagnosed. AF patients more commonly received anticoagulation with an oral anticoagulant (80.4% vs 12.3%) or heparin (61.9% vs 56.9%), had lengthier intensive care unit stay (72 vs 49 hours), and underwent fewer percutaneous coronary interventions (31.9% vs 53.1%). In-hospital bleeding, stroke, and mortality were higher in the AF group (15.3% vs 5.0%, 7.4% vs 2.4%, and 6.9% vs 2.1%, respectively). AF was an independent risk factor for all in-hospital outcomes (odds ratios of 2.5, 2.7, and 2.0 for bleeding, stroke, and mortality, respectively) as well as for postdischarge mortality (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5).
CONCLUSION: AF is present in 25% of ACS patients and increases risk of in-hospital and postdischarge adverse outcomes. Additional data are required to direct optimal management."

Elevated Lp(a) affects approximately one in five individuals and meaningfully contributes to the residual cardiovascular risk in individuals with otherwise well-controlled risk factors. With targeted therapies in the therapeutic pipeline, there is a need to further characterize the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of individuals with elevated levels of this unique biomarker. The Mass General Brigham Lp(a) Registry will be built from the longitudinal electronic health record of two large academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts, to develop a detailed cohort of patients who have had their Lp(a) measured. In combination with structured data sources, clinical documentation will be analyzed using natural language processing techniques to accurately characterize baseline characteristics. Important outcome measures including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events will be available for analysis. Approximately 30 000 patients who have had their Lp(a) tested within the Mass General Brigham system from January 2000 to July 2019 will be included in the registry. This large Lp(a) cohort will provide meaningful observational data regarding the differential risk associated with Lp(a) values and cardiovascular disease.

However, utilising diverse and comprehensive sources of information is especially important when investigating less frequent patterns of medication prescribing such as antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP). This study describes and evaluates a novel method of extracting APP data from both structured and free-text fields in electronic health records (EHRs), and its use for research purposes.
METHODS: Using anonymised EHRs, we identified a cohort of patients with serious mental illness (SMI) who were treated in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust mental health care services between 1 January and 30 June 2012. Information about antipsychotic co-prescribing was extracted using a combination of natural language processing and a bespoke algorithm. The validity of the data derived through this process was assessed against a manually coded gold standard to establish precision and recall. Lastly, we estimated the prevalence and patterns of antipsychotic polypharmacy.
RESULTS: Individual instances of antipsychotic prescribing were detected with high precision (0.94 to 0.97) and moderate recall (0.57-0.77). We detected baseline APP (two or more antipsychotics prescribed in any 6-week window) with 0.92 precision and 0.74 recall and long-term APP (antipsychotic co-prescribing for 6 months) with 0.94 precision and 0.60 recall. Of the 7,201 SMI patients receiving active care during the observation period, 338 (4.7 %; 95 % CI 4.2-5.2) were identified as receiving long-term APP. Two second generation antipsychotics (64.8 %); and first -second generation antipsychotics were most commonly co-prescribed (32.5 %).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that this is a potentially practical tool for identifying polypharmacy from mental health EHRs on a large scale. Furthermore, extracted data can be used to allow researchers to characterize patterns of polypharmacy over time including different drug combinations, trends in polypharmacy prescribing, predictors of polypharmacy prescribing and the impact of polypharmacy on patient outcomes."
25886140,The characteristics and health needs of pregnant women with schizophrenia compared with bipolar disorder and affective psychoses,"Taylor CL, Stewart R, Ogden J, Broadbent M, Pasupathy D, Howard LM.",BMC Psychiatry. 2015 Apr 17;15:88. doi: 10.1186/s12888-015-0451-8.,Taylor CL,BMC Psychiatry,2015,2015/04/18,PMC4406022,,10.1186/s12888-015-0451-8,"BACKGROUND: Most women with psychotic disorders and bipolar disorders have children but their pregnancies are at risk of adverse psychiatric and fetal outcome. The extent of modifiable risk factors - both clinical and socio-demographic - is unclear as most studies have used administrative data or recruited from specialist tertiary referral clinics. We therefore aimed to investigate the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of an epidemiologically representative cohort of pregnant women with affective and non-affective severe mental illness.
METHODS: Women with severe mental illness were identified from a large electronic mental health case register in south London, and a data linkage with national maternity Hospital Episode Statistics identified pregnancies in 2007-2011. Data were extracted using structured fields, text searching and natural language processing applications.
RESULTS: Of 456 pregnant women identified, 236 (51.7%) had schizophrenia and related disorders, 220 (48.3%) had affective psychosis or bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia and related disorders were younger, less likely to have a partner in pregnancy, more likely to be black, to smoke or misuse substances and had significantly more time in the two years before pregnancy in acute care (inpatient or intensive home treatment) compared with women with affective disorders. Both groups had high levels of domestic abuse in pregnancy (recorded in 18.9%), were from relatively deprived backgrounds and had impaired functioning measured by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Women in the affective group were more likely to stop medication in the first trimester (39% versus 25%) whereas women with non-affective psychoses were more likely to switch medication.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of women, particularly those with non-affective psychoses, have modifiable risk factors requiring tailored care to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Mental health professionals need to be mindful of the possibility of pregnancy in women of childbearing age and prescribe and address modifiable risk factors accordingly."
39546783,AI for Analyzing Mental Health Disorders Among Social Media Users: Quarter-Century Narrative Review of Progress and Challenges,"Owen D, Lynham AJ, Smart SE, Pardiñas AF, Camacho Collados J.",J Med Internet Res. 2024 Nov 15;26:e59225. doi: 10.2196/59225.,Owen D,J Med Internet Res,2024,2024/11/15,PMC11607554,,10.2196/59225,"BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders are currently the main contributor to poor quality of life and years lived with disability. Symptoms common to many mental health disorders lead to impairments or changes in the use of language, which are observable in the routine use of social media. Detection of these linguistic cues has been explored throughout the last quarter century, but interest and methodological development have burgeoned following the COVID-19 pandemic. The next decade may see the development of reliable methods for predicting mental health status using social media data. This might have implications for clinical practice and public health policy, particularly in the context of early intervention in mental health care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the state of the art in methods for predicting mental health statuses of social media users. Our focus is the development of artificial intelligence-driven methods, particularly natural language processing, for analyzing large volumes of written text. This study details constraints affecting research in this area. These include the dearth of high-quality public datasets for methodological benchmarking and the need to adopt ethical and privacy frameworks acknowledging the stigma experienced by those with a mental illness.
METHODS: A Google Scholar search yielded peer-reviewed articles dated between 1999 and 2024. We manually grouped the articles by 4 primary areas of interest: datasets on social media and mental health, methods for predicting mental health status, longitudinal analyses of mental health, and ethical aspects of the data and analysis of mental health. Selected articles from these groups formed our narrative review.
RESULTS: Larger datasets with precise dates of participants' diagnoses are needed to support the development of methods for predicting mental health status, particularly in severe disorders such as schizophrenia. Inviting users to donate their social media data for research purposes could help overcome widespread ethical and privacy concerns. In any event, multimodal methods for predicting mental health status appear likely to provide advancements that may not be achievable using natural language processing alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal methods for predicting mental health status from voice, image, and video-based social media data need to be further developed before they may be considered for adoption in health care, medical support, or as consumer-facing products. Such methods are likely to garner greater public confidence in their efficacy than those that rely on text alone. To achieve this, more high-quality social media datasets need to be made available and privacy concerns regarding the use of these data must be formally addressed. A social media platform feature that invites users to share their data upon publication is a possible solution. Finally, a review of literature studying the effects of social media use on a user's depression and anxiety is merited."

Epub 2017 Jul 25.,Zhang H,Ann Intern Med,2017,2017/07/25,,,10.7326/M16-0838,"BACKGROUND: Many patients discontinue statin treatment, often after having a possible adverse reaction. The risks and benefits of continued statin therapy after an adverse reaction are not known.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between continuation of statin therapy (any prescription within 12 months after an adverse reaction) and clinical outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Primary care practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a presumed adverse reaction to a statin between 2000 and 2011.
MEASUREMENTS: Information on adverse reactions to statins was obtained from structured electronic medical record data or natural-language processing of narrative provider notes. The primary composite outcome was time to a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction or stroke) or death.
RESULTS: Most (81%) of the adverse reactions to statins were identified from the text of electronic provider notes. Among 28 266 study patients, 19 989 (70.7%) continued receiving statin prescriptions after the adverse reaction. Four years after the presumed adverse event, the cumulative incidence of the composite primary outcome was 12.2% for patients with continued statin prescriptions, compared with 13.9% for those without them (difference, 1.7% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.7%]; P < 0.001). In a secondary analysis of 7604 patients for whom a different statin was prescribed after the adverse reaction, 2014 (26.5%) had a documented adverse reaction to the second statin, but 1696 (84.2%) of those patients continued receiving statin prescriptions.
LIMITATIONS: The risk for recurrent adverse reactions to statins could not be established for the entire sample. It was also not possible to determine whether patients actually took the statins.
CONCLUSION: Continued statin prescriptions after an adverse reaction were associated with a lower incidence of death and cardiovascular events.

We present the design and validation of an algorithm for SSI detection after hip replacement surgery, and a report of its successful implementation in 4 public hospitals in Madrid, Spain.
METHODS: We designed a multivariable algorithm, AI-HPRO, using natural language processing (NLP) and extreme gradient boosting to screen for SSI in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. The development and validation cohorts included data from 19,661 health care episodes from 4 hospitals in Madrid, Spain.
RESULTS: Positive microbiological cultures, the text variable ""infection"", and prescription of clindamycin were strong markers of SSI. Statistical analysis of the final model indicated high sensitivity (99.18%) and specificity (91.01%) with an F1-score of 0.32, AUC of 0.989, accuracy of 91.27%, and negative predictive value of 99.98%.
DISCUSSION: Implementation of the AI-HPRO algorithm reduced the surveillance time from 975 person/hours to 63.5 person/hours and permitted an 88.95% reduction in the total volume of clinical records to be reviewed manually. The model presents a higher negative predictive value (99.98%) than algorithms relying on NLP alone (94%) or NLP and logistic regression (97%).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an algorithm combining NLP and extreme gradient-boosting to permit accurate, real-time orthopedic SSI surveillance."

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,Zhou N,Oncologist,2019,2018/09/06,PMC6656482,,10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0255,"BACKGROUND: IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), which can use natural language processing to evaluate data in structured and unstructured formats, has begun to be used in China. It provides physicians with evidence-based treatment options and ranks them in three categories for treatment decision support. This study was designed to examine the concordance between the treatment recommendation proposed by WFO and actual clinical decisions by oncologists in our cancer center, which would reflect the differences of cancer treatment between China and the U.S.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data from 362 patients with cancer were ingested into WFO from April 2017 to October 2017. WFO recommendations were provided in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended. Concordance was analyzed by comparing the treatment decisions proposed by WFO with those of the multidisciplinary tumor board. Concordance was achieved when the oncologists' treatment decisions were in the recommended or for consideration categories in WFO.
RESULTS: Ovarian cancer showed the highest concordance, which was 96%. Lung cancer and breast cancer obtained a concordance of slightly above 80%. The concordance of rectal cancer was 74%, whereas colon cancer and cervical cancer showed the same concordance of 64%. In particular, the concordance of gastric cancer was very low, only 12%, and 88% of cases were under physicians choice.
CONCLUSION: Different cancer types showed different concordances, and only gastric cancers were significantly less likely to be concordant. Incidence and pharmaceuticals may be the major cause of discordance. To be comprehensively and rapidly applied in China, WFO needs to accelerate localization.

Ignoring or inadequate attention to those groups in preparing for and responding to disasters and health emergencies could decrease the effectiveness of efforts. This article aims to identify the most basic social vulnerabilities among immigrants and refugees and provide effective solutions to alleviate or eliminate these vulnerabilities.
METHODS: This systematic review was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The main keywords include Social Vulnerabilities, Immigrants, Refugees, and Disasters. All articles published up to February 2023 were reviewed regardless of language and location. A total of 575 articles were extracted from SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases, and finally, 14 articles were selected for full-text analysis. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) was used to evaluate the quality of the selected articles.
RESULTS: Fourteen articles including 4 qualitative and 10 quantitative articles were selected and analyzed in this review. The findings showed: 1. According to the consensus of the studies, the most vulnerable people who need urgent care during an epidemic due to their special conditions are immigrants and refugees; 2. In most countries, no database provides reliable, up-to-date, and accurate statistics about these people; 3. Refugees usually hesitate to express their vulnerability and receive services due to the fear of deportation; and 4. The main challenges faced by refugees are socio-economic problems such as language problems, lack of emotional and social support, and living in crowded places.
CONCLUSION: Considering the prevalence of migration among countries, it is essential to identify the social problems and vulnerabilities of immigrants and provide effective solutions to cope with their challenges, especially during crises and emergencies.

Older studies present 48 h as the timeframe after which infection complication rates rise.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this guideline is to determine if closing the MM within 48 h decreases the risk of wound infection or ventriculitis.
METHODS: The Guidelines Task Force developed search terms and strategies used to search PubMed and Embase for relevant literature published between 1966 and September 2016. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to screen abstracts and to develop a list of relevant articles for full-text review. Full text articles were then reviewed and when appropriate, included in the evidentiary table. The class of evidence was evaluated, discussed, and assigned to each study that met inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 148 abstracts were identified and reviewed. A total of 31 articles were selected for full text analysis. Only 4 of these studies met inclusion criteria.
CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence that operating within 48 h decreases risk of wound infection or ventriculitis in 1 Class III study. There is 1 Class III study that provides evidence of global increase in postoperative infection after 48 h, but is not specific to wound infection or ventriculitis. There is 1 Class III study that provides evidence if surgery is going to be delayed greater than 48 h, antibiotics should be given.The full guideline can be found at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guidelines-spina-bifida-chapter-4."

Epub 2021 Aug 11.,Nunes AP,J Sex Med,2021,2021/08/14,,,10.1016/j.jsxm.2021.06.010,"BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Approximately 1-4% of PDE5i recipients co-possess nitrates, despite this combination potentially producing clinically significant hypotension. Real-world data in these patients and insights into prescriber rationales for co-prescription are limited.
AIM: This study investigated whether PDE5i and nitrate co-possession is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.
METHODS: Adult males with ED and PDE5i prescription and males with nitrate prescription were identified from a U.S. electronic health record database (2012-2016). Quantitative comparisons were made between patients with ED and co-possession (ED + PDE5i + nitrate), only nitrate possession (ED + nitrate and nitrate only [without ED]), and only PDE5i possession (ED + PDE5i).
OUTCOMES: We quantified incidence of CV outcomes in co-possession and comparator periods, calculating incidence rate ratios after propensity score matching. Prescriber rationales were derived by reviewing virtual patient records.
RESULTS: Over 168,000 patients had ≥1 PDE5i prescription (∼241,000 possession periods); >480,000 patients had ≥1 nitrate prescription (∼486,000 possession periods); and 3,167 patients had 3,668 co-possession periods. Non-significantly different or lower rates of CV outcomes were observed for co-possession periods vs ED + nitrate and nitrate only periods. Most CV outcome rates were non-significantly different between co-possession and ED + PDE5i periods (myocardial infarction, hospitalized unstable angina and fainting were higher with co-possession). From qualitative assessment of patient records with co-possession, 131 of 252 (52%) documented discussion with a physician regarding co-possession; 69 of 131 (53%) warned or instructed on safely managing these contraindicated medications.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this real-world study indicate that co-possession of nitrate and PDE5i prescriptions is not associated with increased rates of CV outcomes, relative to possession of nitrates alone. Physicians should and often do discuss the risks of using both medications together with their patients.
STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study are the large size of the U.S. real-world patient cohort with data available for analysis, and our ability to utilize natural language processing to explore co-prescription rationales and patient-physician interactions. Limitations are the retrospective nature of the analysis and inability to establish whether recorded prescriptions were filled or the medication was consumed.
CONCLUSION: Co-exposure of PDE5i and nitrates should continue to be avoided; however, co-possession of PDE5i and nitrate prescriptions is not necessarily associated with increased CV risk. Co-possession can be successfully managed in suitable circumstances. Nunes AP, Seeger JD, Stewart A, et al.

We quantify the occurrence of serious and mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia in a large EHR database in the US, comparing estimates based only on structured data to those from structured data and natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes.
METHODS: This cohort study included patients with type 2 diabetes identified from January 2009 through March 2014. We compared estimates of occurrence of hypoglycemia derived from diagnostic codes to those recorded within clinical notes and classified via NLP. Measures of hypoglycemia from only structured data (ICD-9 Algorithm), only note mentions (NLP Algorithm), and either structured data or notes (Combined Algorithm) were compared with estimates of the period prevalence, incidence rate, and event rate of hypoglycemia, overall and by seriousness.
RESULTS: Of the 844,683 eligible patients, 119,695 had at least one recorded hypoglycemic event identified with ICD-9 or NLP. The period prevalence of hypoglycemia was 12.4%, 25.1%, and 32.2% for the ICD-9 Algorithm, NLP Algorithm, and Combined Algorithm, respectively. There were 6128 apparent non-serious events utilizing the ICD-9 Algorithm, which increased to 152,987 non-serious events within the Combined Algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: Ascertainment of events from clinical notes more than doubled the completeness of hypoglycemia capture overall relative to measures from structured data, and increased capture of non-serious events more than 20-fold. The structured data and clinical notes are complementary within the EHR, and both need to be considered in order to fully assess the occurrence of hypoglycemia."

Risk factors for NAFLD disease progression and liver-related outcomes remain incompletely understood due to the lack of computational identification methods. The present study sought to design a classification algorithm for NAFLD within the electronic medical record (EMR) for the development of large-scale longitudinal cohorts.
METHODS: We implemented feature selection using logistic regression with adaptive LASSO. A training set of 620 patients was randomly selected from the Research Patient Data Registry at Partners Healthcare. To assess a true diagnosis for NAFLD we performed chart reviews and considered either a documentation of a biopsy or a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD. We included in our model variables laboratory measurements, diagnosis codes, and concepts extracted from medical notes. Variables with P < 0.05 were included in the multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: The NAFLD classification algorithm included number of natural language mentions of NAFLD in the EMR, lifetime number of ICD-9 codes for NAFLD, and triglyceride level. This classification algorithm was superior to an algorithm using ICD-9 data alone with AUC of 0.85 versus 0.75 (P < 0.0001) and leads to the creation of a new independent cohort of 8458 individuals with a high probability for NAFLD.
CONCLUSIONS: The NAFLD classification algorithm is superior to ICD-9 billing data alone. This approach is simple to develop, deploy, and can be applied across different institutions to create EMR-based cohorts of individuals with NAFLD."

Changes in the risk factors for, distributions of underlying diseases associated with and clinical characteristics of some individual PFIs have been reported in the past decade. However, data regarding PFIs remain uncertain. This study reports the epidemiological characteristics and trends of PFIs over time in recent years. We applied an automated natural language processing (NLP) system to extract clinically relevant information from the electronic health records (EHRs) of PFI patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Then, a trend analysis was performed. From January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2019, 40,504 inpatients and 219,414 outpatients with respiratory diseases were screened, in which 1368 inpatients and 1313 outpatients with PFI were identified. These patients were from throughout the country, but most patients were from southern China. Upward trends in PFIs were observed in both hospitalized patients and outpatients (P&lt;0.05). The stratification by age showed that the incidence of hospitalized patients aged 14-30 years exhibited the most obvious upward trend, increasing from 9.5 per 1000 patients in 2013 to 88.3 per 1000 patients in 2019. Aspergillosis (56.69%) was the most common PFI, but notably, the incidence rates of Talaromyces marneffei, which used to be considered uncommon, exhibited the most rapid increases. In younger PFI patients, the incidence and trend of PFIs have increased. Infection by previously uncommon pathogens has also gradually increased. Increased attention should be paid to young PFI patients and uncommon PFI pathogen infections."

A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes.
FINDINGS: The analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p<0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p<0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse. Distinct subtypes were delineated after examining multiple domains of EHR data and applying methods in artificial intelligence. The approach with LCA and readily available class-defining substance use variables from the EHR may be applied as a prognostic enrichment strategy for targeted interventions."

Epub 2018 Mar 14.,Garot E,J Dent,2018,2018/03/19,,,10.1016/j.jdent.2018.03.005,"OBJECTIVES: Molar Incisor Hypomineralisation (MIH) and Hypomineralised Second Primary Molars (HSPM) involve qualitative structural developmental anomalies of tooth enamel affecting the first permanent molars (and often incisors) and the second primary molars, respectively. A putative relationship between HSPM and MIH has been reported in the scientific literature. The aim was to determine whether children with HSPM are more likely to develop MIH.
SOURCE: A systematic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library electronic databases for publications from 2001 to August 2017 investigating the link between MIH and HSPM was undertaken.
STUDY SELECTION: Four reviewers selected the studies independently, extracted the data according to PRISMA statement, and assessed the bias risk with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria.
RESULTS: From 645 potentially eligible studies, 14 were selected for full text analysis and 5 were included in the meta-analysis. Cross-sectional and cohort studies were reported and 4662 participants were included. The meta-analyses were performed with a random model calculated an OR total of 4.66 (95% CI 2.11-10.26; P < 0.001). The weighted mean of the co-occurrence of HSPM and MIH prevalence was 19.94%.
DISCUSSION: The high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%) can be explained by the great variation present in number of participants and variable caries risk. Despite the limitations of the study, the presence of HSPM is predictive for MIH, with greater MIH prevalence in the presence of mild HSPM.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Early detection and preventive intervention could reduce MIH complications."

Epub 2021 Dec 3.,Nunes AP,J Sex Med,2022,2021/12/07,,,10.1016/j.jsxm.2021.10.012,"BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting male adults and may be associated with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as tadalafil, are the first-line drug therapy for ED. Studies and the current prescribing information of these PDE5 inhibitors indicate they are mechanistic mild vasodilators and, as such, concomitant use of a PDE5 inhibitor with anti-hypertensive medication may lead to drops in blood pressure due to possible drug-drug interaction.
AIM: Evaluate risks of hypotensive/cardiovascular outcomes in a large cohort of patients with ED that have co-possession of prescriptions for tadalafil and hypertensive medications versus either medication/s alone.
METHODS: A cohort study conducted within an electronic health record database (Optum) representing hospitals across the US. Adult male patients prescribed tadalafil and/or anti-hypertensive medications from January 2012 to December 2017 were eligible. Possession periods were defined by the time patients likely had possession of medication, with propensity score-matched groups used for comparison.
OUTCOMES: Risk of hypotensive/cardiovascular outcomes were measured using diagnostic codes and NLP algorithms during possession periods of tadalafil + anti-hypertensive versus either medication/s alone.
RESULTS: In total there were 127,849 tadalafil + anti-hypertensive medication possession periods, 821,359 anti-hypertensive only medication possession periods, and 98,638 tadalafil only medication possession periods during the study; 126,120 were successfully matched. Adjusted-matched incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the anti-hypertensive only possession periods compared with tadalafil + anti-hypertensive periods of diagnosed outcomes were all below 1. Two outcomes had a 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not include 1.0: ventricular arrhythmia (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66, 0.94) and diagnosis of hypotension (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71, 0.89).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Provides real world evidence that co-possession of tadalafil and anti-hypertensive medications does not increase risk of hypotensive/cardiovascular outcomes beyond that observed for patients in possession of anti-hypertensive medications only.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: EHR data are valuable for the evaluation of real world outcomes, however, the data are retrospective and collected for clinical patient management rather than research. Prescription data represent the intent of the prescriber and not use by the patient. Residual bias cannot be ruled out, despite propensity score matching, due to unobserved patient characteristics and severity that are not fully reflected in the EHR database.
CONCLUSION: In the studied real world patients, this study did not demonstrate an increased risk of hypotensive or cardiovascular outcomes associated with co-possession of tadalafil and anti-hypertensive medications beyond that observed for patients in possession of anti-hypertensive medications only.

35767327,Identifying Medication-Related Intents From a Bidirectional Text Messaging Platform for Hypertension Management Using an Unsupervised Learning Approach: Retrospective Observational Pilot Study,"Davoudi A, Lee NS, Luong T, Delaney T, Asch E, Chaiyachati K, Mowery D.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jun 29;24(6):e36151. doi: 10.2196/36151.,Davoudi A,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/06/29,PMC9280462,,10.2196/36151,"BACKGROUND: Free-text communication between patients and providers plays an increasing role in chronic disease management, through platforms varying from traditional health care portals to novel mobile messaging apps. These text data are rich resources for clinical purposes, but their sheer volume render them difficult to manage. Even automated approaches, such as natural language processing, require labor-intensive manual classification for developing training data sets. Automated approaches to organizing free-text data are necessary to facilitate use of free-text communication for clinical care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to apply unsupervised learning approaches to (1) understand the types of topics discussed and (2) learn medication-related intents from messages sent between patients and providers through a bidirectional text messaging system for managing participant blood pressure (BP).
METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of deidentified messages from a remote, mobile, text-based employee hypertension management program at an academic institution. We trained a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for each message type (ie, inbound patient messages and outbound provider messages) and identified the distribution of major topics and significant topics (probability >.20) across message types. Next, we annotated all medication-related messages with a single medication intent. Then, we trained a second medication-specific LDA (medLDA) model to assess how well the unsupervised method could identify more fine-grained medication intents. We encoded each medication message with n-grams (n=1-3 words) using spaCy, clinical named entities using Stanza, and medication categories using MedEx; we then applied chi-square feature selection to learn the most informative features associated with each medication intent.
RESULTS: In total, 253 participants and 5 providers engaged in the program, generating 12,131 total messages: 46.90% (n=5689) patient messages and 53.10% (n=6442) provider messages. Most patient messages corresponded to BP reporting, BP encouragement, and appointment scheduling; most provider messages corresponded to BP reporting, medication adherence, and confirmatory statements. Most patient and provider messages contained 1 topic and few contained more than 3 topics identified using LDA. In total, 534 medication messages were annotated with a single medication intent. Of these, 282 (52.8%) were patient medication messages: most referred to the medication request intent (n=134, 47.5%). Most of the 252 (47.2%) provider medication messages referred to the medication question intent (n=173, 68.7%). Although the medLDA model could identify a majority intent within each topic, it could not distinguish medication intents with low prevalence within patient or provider messages. Richer feature engineering identified informative lexical-semantic patterns associated with each medication intent class.
CONCLUSIONS: LDA can be an effective method for generating subgroups of messages with similar term usage and facilitating the review of topics to inform annotations. However, few training cases and shared vocabulary between intents precludes the use of LDA for fully automated, deep, medication intent classification.

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of household-contact investigation, as compared with standard, passive measures alone, in Vietnam.
METHODS: We performed a cluster-randomized, controlled trial at clinics in 70 districts (local government areas with an average population of approximately 500,000 in urban areas and 100,000 in rural areas) in eight provinces of Vietnam. Health workers at each district clinic or hospital were assigned to perform either household-contact intervention plus standard passive case finding (intervention group) or passive case finding alone (control group). In the intervention districts, household contacts of patients with positive results for tuberculosis on sputum smear microscopy (smear-positive tuberculosis) were invited for clinical assessment and chest radiography at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of registered cases of tuberculosis among household contacts of patients with tuberculosis during a 2-year period.
RESULTS: In 70 selected districts, we enrolled 25,707 household contacts of 10,964 patients who had smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. In the 36 districts that were included in the intervention group, 180 of 10,069 contacts were registered as having tuberculosis (1788 cases per 100,000 population), as compared with 110 of 15,638 contacts (703 per 100,000) in the control group (relative risk of the primary outcome in the intervention group, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 3.2; P<0.001); the relative risk of smear-positive disease among household contacts in the intervention group was 6.4 (95% CI, 4.5 to 9.0; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Household-contact investigation plus standard passive case finding was more effective than standard passive case finding alone for the detection of tuberculosis in a high-prevalence setting at 2 years.

One dimension of EHR data quality assessment is 'currency' or timeliness, that is, data are representative of the patient state at the time of measurement. We explored the use of free text in UK general practice patient records to evaluate delays in recording of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis. We also aimed to locate and quantify disease and diagnostic information recorded only in text.
SETTING: UK general practice patient records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
PARTICIPANTS: 294 individuals with incident diagnosis of RA between 2005 and 2008; 204 women and 85 men, median age 63 years.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of (1) quantity and timing of text entries for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as a proxy for the RA disease code, and (2) quantity, location and timing of free text information relating to RA onset and diagnosis.
RESULTS: Inflammatory markers, pain and DMARDs were the most common categories of disease information in text prior to RA diagnostic code; 10-37% of patients had such information only in text. Read codes associated with RA-related text included correspondence, general consultation and arthritis codes. 64 patients (22%) had DMARD text entries >14 days prior to RA code; these patients had more and earlier referrals to rheumatology, tests, swelling, pain and DMARD prescriptions, suggestive of an earlier implicit diagnosis than was recorded by the diagnostic code.
CONCLUSIONS: RA-related symptoms, tests, referrals and prescriptions were recorded in free text with 22% of patients showing strong evidence of delay in coding of diagnosis. Researchers using EHRs may need to mitigate for delayed codes by incorporating text into their case-ascertainment strategies. Natural language processing techniques have the capability to do this at scale."

The PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, and EMBASE databases were searched for randomized clinical trials related to the research topic. The gray literature and reference lists were also assessed. Network meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of different approaches on PDC eruption. The surface under the cumulative ranking area was calculated to rank the treatments. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Of the 892 eligible studies, 18 were selected for full-text analysis and 9 for meta-analysis, involving 506 participants and 730 PDC, to compare 9 approaches. The proportion of erupted PDC was significantly higher for all interceptive treatments compared with control (no intervention). Furthermore, the proportion of erupted PDC was higher in patients subjected to rapid maxillary expansion (RME) than those who underwent double extraction of primary canine and primary molar (relative risk (RR) = 2.68 ICr95%: 1.12-9.35). A higher proportion of erupted PDC was found for RME (RR = 3.07 ICr95%: 1.31-10.67), RME plus use of transpalatal arch (TA) plus extraction of primary canine(s) (EC) (RR = 1.43 ICr95%: 1.09-1.95), EC plus use of cervical pull headgear (RR = 1.38 ICr95%: 1.11-1.79), and EC plus use of TA (RR = 1.36 ICr95%: 1.00-1.9) than for EC. RME was most likely to be considered as the best interceptive treatment. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was considered low due to imprecision and indirectness. In conclusion, no intervention in the mixed dentition stage is the worst choice for PDC."

Moni--a system for monitoring nosocomial infections in intensive care units for adult and neonatal patients--employs knowledge bases that were written with extensive use of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, allowing the inherent un-sharpness of clinical terms and the inherent uncertainty of clinical conclusions to be a part of Moni's output. Thus, linguistic as well as propositional uncertainty became a part of Moni, which can now report retrospectively on HAIs according to traditional crisp HAI surveillance definitions, as well as support clinical bedside work by more complex crisp and fuzzy alerts and reminders. This improved approach can bridge the gap between classical retrospective surveillance of HAIs and ongoing prospective clinical-decision-oriented HAI support."

METHODS: Indication was evaluated among the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) breast cancer research centers (PRCs). Indication data were reported overall and separately for four breast imaging modalities: digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: The breast PRCs contributed 236,262 women with 607,735 breast imaging records from 31 radiology facilities. We found a high degree of heterogeneity for indication within and across six data sources. Structured codes within a data source were used most often to identify indication for mammography (59% DM, 85% DBT) and text analytics for US (45%) and MRI (44%). Indication could not be identified for 17% of US and 26% of MRI compared with 2% of mammography examinations (1% DM, 3% DBT).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple and diverse data sources, heterogeneity of ascertainment methods, and nonstandardization of codes within and across data systems for determining indication were found. Consideration of data sources and standardized methodology for determining indication is needed to assure accurate measurement of cancer screening rates and performance in clinical practice and research."

Hence, the identification and characterization of these HIV-1 reservoirs were the focus of many studies during the past decades. In this review, a systematic literature screening and text mining approach were implemented to assess the evolution in experimental design of these HIV-1 reservoir studies. For this purpose, the online databases PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were consulted and 1768 articles were identified, of which 106 are included in this review. We observed several evolutions that indicate a more structured approach of recent HIV-1 reservoir studies. This includes the use of well-characterized patient cohorts, tissue sampling at several time points and anatomical compartments, the inclusion of patients with different treatment status (on and off antiretroviral therapy), and the implementation of state-of-the-art research techniques such as single genome sequencing. In addition, there is an increased interest and sampling of lymphoid tissues and cerebrospinal fluid together with methods to investigate cellular subsets and HIV-1 sequences. Overall, this review describes an observed shift from detecting and quantifying HIV-1 toward a qualitative in-depth assessment of anatomical reservoirs and cellular subsets playing a role in HIV-1 persistence/latency. These trends coincide with the evolution in focus from controlling HIV-1 replication by currently available antiretroviral therapy toward HIV-1 curative strategies."

To facilitate this, we aimed to develop and evaluate a comprehensive and efficient search strategy in PubMed, to be used by either researchers or practitioners and that will identify articles on the prognosis of work disability.
METHODS: We used a diagnostic test analytic framework. First, we created a reference set of 225 articles on the prognosis of work disability by screening a total of 65,692 titles and abstracts from10 journals in the period 2000-2009. Included studies had a minimum follow-up of 6 months, participants in the age of 18-64 with a minimum sick leave of 4 weeks or longer or having serious activity limitations in 50% of the cases and outcome measures that reflect impairments, activity limitations or participation restrictions. Using text mining methods, we extracted search terms from the reference set and, according to sensitivity and relative frequency, we combined these into search strings.
RESULTS: Both the research and the practice search filter outperformed existing filters in occupational health, all combined with the Yale-prognostic filter. The Work Disability Prognosis filter for Research showed a comprehensiveness of 90% (95% CI 86 to 94) and efficiency expressed more user-friendly as Number Needed to Read=20 (95% CI 17 to 34).
CONCLUSIONS: The Work Disability Prognosis filter will help practitioners and researchers who want to find prognostic evidence in the area of work disability evaluation. However, further refining of this filter is possible and needed, especially for the practitioner for whom efficiency is especially important."

Alterations of the microbiome (dysbiosis) have been linked with a number of diseases such as cancers, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, etc. Generally, differential abundance testing between the healthy and patient groups is performed to identify important bacteria (enriched or depleted in one group). However, simply providing a singular species of bacteria to an individual lacking that species for health improvement has not been as successful as fecal matter transplant (FMT) therapy. Interestingly, FMT therapy transfers the entire gut microbiome of a healthy (or mixture of) individual to an individual with a disease. FMTs do, however, have limited success, possibly due to concerns that not all bacteria in the community may be responsible for the healthy phenotype. Therefore, it is important to identify the community of microorganisms linked to the health as well as the disease state of the host. Here we applied topic modeling, a natural language processing tool, to assess latent interactions occurring among microbes; thus, providing a representation of the community of bacteria relevant to healthy vs. disease state. Specifically, we utilized our previously published data that studied the gut microbiome of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), a neurodegenerative autoimmune disease that has been linked to a variety of factors, including a dysbiotic gut microbiome. With topic modeling we identified communities of bacteria associated with RRMS, including genera previously discovered, but also other taxa that would have been overlooked simply with differential abundance testing. Our work shows that topic modeling can be a useful tool for analyzing the microbiome in dysbiosis and that it could be considered along with the commonly utilized differential abundance tests to better understand the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease."

METHODS: We screened the GBA coding region for mutations and the E326K polymorphism in 1,369 PD patients enrolled at eight sites from the PD Cognitive Genetics Consortium. Participants underwent assessments of learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised), working memory/executive function (Letter-Number Sequencing Test and Trail Making Test A and B), language processing (semantic and phonemic verbal fluency), visuospatial abilities (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation), and global cognitive function (MoCA). We used linear regression to test for association between genotype and cognitive performance with adjustment for important covariates and accounted for multiple testing using Bonferroni's corrections.
RESULTS: Mutation carriers (n = 60; 4.4%) and E326K carriers (n = 65; 4.7%) had a higher prevalence of dementia (mutations, odds ratio = 5.1; P = 9.7 × 10(-6) ; E326K, odds ratio = 6.4; P = 5.7 × 10(-7) ) and lower performance on Letter-Number Sequencing (mutations, corrected P[Pc ] = 9.0 × 10(-4) ; E326K, Pc  = 0.036), Trail Making B-A (mutations, Pc  = 0.018; E326K, Pc  = 0.018), and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (mutations, Pc  = 0.0045; E326K, Pc  = 0.0013).
CONCLUSIONS: Both GBA mutations and E326K are associated with a distinct cognitive profile characterized by greater impairment in working memory/executive function and visuospatial abilities in PD patients. The discovery that E326K negatively impacts cognitive performance approximately doubles the proportion of PD patients we now recognize are at risk for more severe GBA-related cognitive deficits."

A systematic review of existing research on COVID-19 and medical waste can help address these challenges by providing insights and recommendations for effective management of the massive medical waste generated during the pandemic. This study utilized bibliometric and text mining methods to survey the scientific outcomes related to COVID-19 and medical waste, drawing on data from the Scopus database. The results show that the spatial distribution of medical waste research is unbalanced. Surprisingly, developing countries rather than developed countries lead research in this area. Especially, China, a major contributor to the field, has the highest number of publications and citations, and is also a centre of international cooperation. The main study authors and research institutions are also mainly from China. And the research on medical waste is a multidisciplinary field. Text mining analysis shows that COVID-19 and medical waste research is mainly organized around four themes: (i) medical waste from personal protective equipment; (ii) research on medical waste in Wuhan, China; (iii) threats of medical waste to the environment and (iv) disposal and management of medical waste. This would serve to better understand the current state of medical waste research and to provide some implications for future research."
31824670,Evidence-based Clinical Decision Support Systems for the prediction and detection of three disease states in critical care: A systematic literature review,"Medic G, Kosaner Kließ M, Atallah L, Weichert J, Panda S, Postma M, El-Kerdi A.",F1000Res. 2019 Oct 8;8:1728. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.20498.2. eCollection 2019.,Medic G,F1000Res,2019,2019/12/14,PMC6894361,,10.12688/f1000research.20498.2,"Background: Clinical decision support (CDS) systems have emerged as tools providing intelligent decision making to address challenges of critical care. CDS systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems."
37294728,Monitoring real-time junior doctor sentiment from comments on a public social media platform: a retrospective observational study,"Sirkis T, Maitland S.",Postgrad Med J. 2023 Jun 8;99(1171):423-427. doi: 10.1136/pmj-2022-142080.,Sirkis T,Postgrad Med J,2023,2023/06/09,,,10.1136/pmj-2022-142080,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether sentiment analysis and topic modelling can be used to monitor the sentiment and opinions of junior doctors.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study based on comments on a social media website.
SETTING: Every publicly available comment in r/JuniorDoctorsUK on Reddit from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: 7707 Reddit users who commented in the r/JuniorDoctorsUK subreddit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sentiment (scored -1 to +1) of comments compared with results of surveys conducted by the General Medical Council.
RESULTS: Average comment sentiment was positive but varied significantly during the study period. Fourteen topics of discussion were identified, each associated with a different pattern of sentiment. The topic with the highest proportion of negative comments was the role of a doctor (38%), and the topic with the most positive sentiment was hospital reviews (72%).
CONCLUSION: Some topics discussed in social media are comparable to those queried in traditional questionnaires, whereas other topics are distinctive and offer insight into what themes junior doctors care about. Events during the coronavirus pandemic may explain the sentiment trends in the junior doctor community. Natural language processing shows significant potential in generating insights into junior doctors' opinions and sentiment."
25332356,A novel method of adverse event detection can accurately identify venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) from narrative electronic health record data,"Rochefort CM, Verma AD, Eguale T, Lee TC, Buckeridge DL.",J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2015 Jan;22(1):155-65. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002768. Epub 2014 Oct 20.,Rochefort CM,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2015,2014/10/22,PMC4433368,,10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002768,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolisms (VTEs), which include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and cost in hospitalized patients. To evaluate the success of preventive measures, accurate and efficient methods for monitoring VTE rates are needed. Therefore, we sought to determine the accuracy of statistical natural language processing (NLP) for identifying DVT and PE from electronic health record data.
METHODS: We randomly sampled 2000 narrative radiology reports from patients with a suspected DVT/PE in Montreal (Canada) between 2008 and 2012. We manually identified DVT/PE within each report, which served as our reference standard. Using a bag-of-words approach, we trained 10 alternative support vector machine (SVM) models predicting DVT, and 10 predicting PE. SVM training and testing was performed with nested 10-fold cross-validation, and the average accuracy of each model was measured and compared.
RESULTS: On manual review, 324 (16.2%) reports were DVT-positive and 154 (7.7%) were PE-positive. The best DVT model achieved an average sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.85), specificity of 0.98 (98% CI 0.97 to 0.99), positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93), and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). The best PE model achieved sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.85), specificity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 0.99), PPV of 0.84 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.92), and AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Statistical NLP can accurately identify VTE from narrative radiology reports."

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used RobotReviewer LIVE to keep a review of COVID-19 vaccination trials updated from February to August 2021. We compared the papers identified by the system with those found by the conventional manual process by the review team.
RESULTS: The manual update searches (last search date July 2021) retrieved 135 abstracts, of which 31 were included after screening (23% precision, 100% recall). By the same date, the automated system retrieved 56 abstracts, of which 31 were included after manual screening (55% precision, 100% recall). Key limitations of the system include that it is limited to searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, and considers only randomized controlled trial reports. We aim to address these limitations in future. The system is available as open-source software for further piloting and evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Our system identified all relevant studies, reduced manual screening work, and enabled rolling updates on publication of new primary research."
31751813,"Leveraging crowdsourcing methods to collect qualitative data in addiction science: Narratives of non-medical prescription opioid, heroin, and fentanyl use","Strickland JC, Victor GA.",Int J Drug Policy. 2020 Jan;75:102587. doi: 10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.10.013. Epub 2019 Nov 18.,Strickland JC,Int J Drug Policy,2020,2019/11/22,PMC6957729,NIHMS1542436,10.1016/j.drugpo.2019.10.013,"BACKGROUND: Online crowdsourcing methods have proved useful for studies of diverse designs in the behavioral and addiction sciences. The remote and online setting of crowdsourcing research may provide easier access to unique participant populations and improved comfort for these participants in sharing sensitive health or behavioral information. To date, few studies have evaluated the use of qualitative research methods on crowdsourcing platforms and even fewer have evaluated the quality of data gathered. The purpose of the present analysis was to document the feasibility and validity of using crowdsourcing techniques for collecting qualitative data among people who use drugs.
METHODS: Participants (N = 60) with a history of non-medical prescription opioid use with transition to heroin or fentanyl use were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). A battery of qualitative questions was included indexing beliefs and behaviors surrounding opioid use, transition pathways to heroin and/or fentanyl use, and drug-related contacts with structural institutions (e.g., health care, criminal justice).
RESULTS: Qualitative data recruitment was feasible as evidenced by the rapid sampling of a relatively large number of participants from diverse geographic regions. Computerized text analysis indicated high ratings of authenticity for the provided narratives. These authenticity percentiles were higher than the average of general normative writing samples as well as than those collected in experimental settings.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility and quality of qualitative data collected in online settings, broadly, and crowdsourced settings, specifically. Future work among people who use drugs may leverage crowdsourcing methods and the access to hard-to-sample populations to complement existing studies in the human laboratory and clinic as well as those using other digital technology methods."

Epub 2020 Jun 18.,Alexander C,J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,2020,2020/08/19,,,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105018,"INTRODUCTION: Recent clinical comparisons of M1 and M2 segment endovascular thrombectomy have reached incongruous results in rates of complication and functional outcomes. This study aims to clarify the controversy surrounding this rapidly advancing technique through literature review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A Pubmed search was performed (January 2015-September 2019) using the following keywords: ""M2 AND (""stroke"" OR ""occlusion"") AND (""thrombectomy"" OR ""endovascular"")"". Safety and clinical outcomes were compared between segments via weighted Student's t-test, Chi-square and odds ratio while study heterogeneity was analyzed using Cochran Q and I2 tests.
RESULTS: Pubmed identified 208 articles and eleven studies were included after full-text analysis, comprising 2,548 M1 and 758 M2 mechanical thrombectomy segment cases. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were comparatively lower in patients experiencing an M2 occlusion (16 ± 1.25 vs 13.6 ± 0.96, p < 0.01). Patients who underwent M2 mechanical thrombectomy were more likely to experience both good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) (48.6% vs 43.5% respectively, OR 1.24; CI 1.05-1.47, p = 0.01) and excellent clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) (34.7% vs. 26.5%%, OR 1.6; CI 1.28-1.99, p < 0.01) at 90 days compared to M1 mechanical thrombectomy. Neither recanalization rates (75.3% vs 72.8%, OR 0.92, CI 0.75-1.13, p = 0.44) nor symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates (5.6% vs 4.9%, OR 0.92; CI 0.61-1.39, p= 0.7) were significantly different between M1 and M2 cohorts. Mortality was less frequent in the M2 cohort compared to M1 (16.3% vs 20.7%, OR 0.73; CI 0.57-0.94, p = 0.01). M1 and M2 cohorts did not differ in symptom onset-to-puncture (238.1 ± 46.7 vs 239.8 ± 43.9 min respectively, p=0.488) nor symptom onset-to recanalization times (318.7 ± 46.6 vs 317.7 ± 71.1 min respectively, p = 0.772), though mean operative duration was shorter in the M2 cohort (61.8 ± 25.5 vs 54.6 ± 24 min, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent M2 mechanical thrombectomy had a higher prevalence of good and excellent clinical outcomes compared to the M1 mechanical thrombectomy cohorts. Additionally, our data suggest lower mortality rates in the M2 cohort and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates that are similar to the M1 cohort. Therefore, M2 segment thrombectomy likely does not pose a significantly elevated operative risk and may have a positive impact on patient outcomes."

Recent guidelines for CRBSI recommend empirical therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) and restrict coverage for Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) only to specific circumstances.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate predictors of GNB aetiology in CRBSI and to assess the predictors of outcome in patients with CRBSI.
METHODS: Patients with CRBSI were selected from the PROBAC cohort, a prospective, observational, multicentre national cohort study including patients with bloodstream infections consecutively admitted to 26 Spanish hospitals in a 6 month period (October 2016-March 2017). Outcome variables were GNB aetiology and 30 day mortality. Adjusted analyses were performed by logistic regression.
RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-one episodes of CRBSI were included in the study. Risk factors independently related to GNB aetiology were central venous catheter (CVC) [OR 1.60 (95% CI: 1.05-2.44), P = 0.028], sepsis/septic shock [OR: 1.76 (95% CI: 1.11-2.80), P = 0.016], antibiotic therapy in the previous 30 days [OR: 1.56 (95% CI: 1.02-2.36), P = 0.037], neutropenia <500/μL [OR: 2.01 (95% CI: 1.04-3.87), P = 0.037] and peripheral vascular disease [OR: 2.04 (95% CI: 1.13-3.68), P = 0.018]. GNB were not associated with increased mortality in adjusted analysis, while removal of catheter [OR: 0.24 (95% CI: 0.09-0.61), P = 0.002] and adequate empirical treatment [OR: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.18-0.77), P = 0.008] were strong protective factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the recommendation that empirical coverage should cover GNB in patients presenting with sepsis/septic shock and in neutropenic patients. Catheter removal and adequate empirical treatment were both protective factors against mortality in patients with CRBSI."

Epub 2023 Feb 8.,Pilowsky JK,Crit Care Med,2023,2023/02/08,,,10.1097/CCM.0000000000005792,"OBJECTIVES: Mental illness is known to adversely affect the physical health of patients in primary and acute care settings; however, its impact on critically ill patients is less well studied. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of patients admitted to the ICU with a preexisting mental health disorder.
DESIGN: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study using linked data from electronic ICU clinical progress notes and the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database.
SETTING/PATIENTS: All patients admitted to eight Australian adult ICUs in the calendar year 2019. Readmissions within the same hospitalization were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Natural language processing techniques were used to classify preexisting mental health disorders in participants based on clinician documentation in electronic ICU clinical progress notes. Sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-eight patients (58% male) were included in the study, of which 5,044 (31.1%) had a documented preexisting mental health disorder. Affective disorders were the most common subtype occurring in 2,633 patients (16.2%), followed by anxiety disorders, occurring in 1,611 patients (9.9%). Mixed-effects regression modeling found patients with a preexisting mental health disorder stayed in ICU 13% longer than other patients (β-coefficient, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.10-0.15) and were more likely to experience invasive ventilation (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.30-1.56). Severity of illness and ICU mortality rates were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preexisting mental health disorders form a significant subgroup within the ICU. The presence of a preexisting mental health disorder is associated with greater ICU length of stay and higher rates of invasive ventilation, suggesting these patients may have a different clinical trajectory to patients with no mental health history. Further research is needed to better understand the reasons for these adverse outcomes and to develop interventions to better support these patients during and after ICU admission."

Epub 2018 Apr 17.,Kaspar M,Clin Res Cardiol,2018,2018/04/19,PMC6105250,,10.1007/s00392-018-1245-z,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure is the predominant cause of hospitalization and amongst the leading causes of death in Germany. However, accurate estimates of prevalence and incidence are lacking. Reported figures originating from different information sources are compromised by factors like economic reasons or documentation quality.
METHODS: We implemented a clinical data warehouse that integrates various information sources (structured parameters, plain text, data extracted by natural language processing) and enables reliable approximations to the real number of heart failure patients. Performance of ICD-based diagnosis in detecting heart failure was compared across the years 2000-2015 with (a) advanced definitions based on algorithms that integrate various sources of the hospital information system, and (b) a physician-based reference standard.
RESULTS: Applying these methods for detecting heart failure in inpatients revealed that relying on ICD codes resulted in a marked underestimation of the true prevalence of heart failure, ranging from 44% in the validation dataset to 55% (single year) and 31% (all years) in the overall analysis. Percentages changed over the years, indicating secular changes in coding practice and efficiency. Performance was markedly improved using search and permutation algorithms from the initial expert-specified query (F1 score of 81%) to the computer-optimized query (F1 score of 86%) or, alternatively, optimizing precision or sensitivity depending on the search objective.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimating prevalence of heart failure using ICD codes as the sole data source yielded unreliable results. Diagnostic accuracy was markedly improved using dedicated search algorithms. Our approach may be transferred to other hospital information systems."

Then, we examined the prevalence of these conditions in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) and compared their individual and combined prevalence in individuals with bipolar (BD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD).
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Secondary mental healthcare services from South London PARTICIPANTS: Our maximal sample comprised 17 500 individuals aged 15 years or older who had received a primary or secondary SMI diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, F20-31) between 2007 and 2018.
MEASURES: We designed and implemented a data extraction strategy for 21 common physical comorbidities using a natural language processing pipeline, MedCAT. Associations were investigated with sex, age at SMI diagnosis, ethnicity and social deprivation for the whole cohort and the BD and SSD subgroups. Linear regression models were used to examine associations with disability measured by the Health of Nations Outcome Scale.
RESULTS: Physical health data were extracted, achieving precision rates (F1) above 0.90 for all conditions. The 10 most prevalent conditions were diabetes, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, epilepsy, cerebrovascular accident, eczema, migraine, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most prevalent combination in this population included diabetes, hypertension and asthma, regardless of their SMI diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data extraction strategy was found to be adequate to extract physical health data from clinical notes, which is essential for future multimorbidity research using text records. We found that around 40% of our cohort had multimorbidity from which 20% had complex multimorbidity (two or more physical conditions besides SMI). Sex, age, ethnicity and social deprivation were found to be key to understand their heterogeneity and their differential contribution to disability levels in this population. These outputs have direct implications for researchers and clinicians."

Epub 2016 Oct 27.,McCoy TH Jr,Psychosomatics,2017,2017/01/15,,,10.1016/j.psym.2016.10.007,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute confusional state, associated with morbidity and mortality in diverse medically ill populations. Delirium is preventable and treatable when diagnosed but the diagnosis is often missed. This important and difficult diagnosis is an attractive candidate for computer-aided decision support if it can be reliably identified at scale.
OBJECTIVE: Here, using an electronic health record-based case definition of delirium, we characterize incidence of this highly morbid condition in 2 large academic medical centers.
METHODS: Using the electronic health record of 2 large New England academic medical centers, we calculated and compared the rate of the diagnosis of delirium using a range of administrative and discharge summary text-based case definitions over an 8-year period.
RESULTS: Depending on case definitions, the overall delirium rate ranged from 2.0-5.4% of 809,512 admissions identified. The identified rate of delirium increased between 2005 and 2013, such that by the final year of the study, one of the two sites reported delirium in 7.0% of cases. The concordance between case definitions was low; only half of the cases identified by text analysis were captured by administrative data.
CONCLUSION: Delirium may be better captured by composite outcomes, including both administrative claims data and elements drawn from unstructured data sources. That the rate of delirium observed in this study is far lower than the current literature estimates suggests that further work on case definitions, identification, and documented diagnosis is required."

Current measurement is restricted by limitations in existing measurement systems in the developing world and the lack of biometry tests for non-communicable diseases. Diagnosis based on self-reported signs and symptoms (""Symptomatic Diagnosis,"" or SD) analyzed with computer-based algorithms may be a promising method for collecting timely and reliable information on non-communicable disease prevalence. The objective of this study was to develop and assess the performance of a symptom-based questionnaire to estimate prevalence of non-communicable diseases in low-resource areas.
METHODS: As part of the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium study, we collected 1,379 questionnaires in Mexico from individuals who suffered from a non-communicable disease that had been diagnosed with gold standard diagnostic criteria or individuals who did not suffer from any of the 10 target conditions. To make the diagnosis of non-communicable diseases, we selected the Tariff method, a technique developed for verbal autopsy cause of death calculation. We assessed the performance of this instrument and analytical techniques at the individual and population levels.
RESULTS: The questionnaire revealed that the information on health care experience retrieved achieved 66.1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 65.6-66.5%) chance corrected concordance with true diagnosis of non-communicable diseases using health care experience and 0.826 (95% UI, 0.818-0.834) accuracy in its ability to calculate fractions of different causes. SD is also capable of outperforming the current estimation techniques for conditions estimated by questionnaire-based methods.
CONCLUSIONS: SD is a viable method for producing estimates of the prevalence of non-communicable diseases in areas with low health information infrastructure. This technology can provide higher-resolution prevalence data, more flexible data collection, and potentially individual diagnoses for certain conditions."

This study investigates the extent to which the evolution of telemedicine applications has been used to support patient care in Latin America (LATAM) amidst the pandemic. Theoretically, the study applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to identify the impact of telemedicine in the region. Practically, the paper provides a systematic mapping study of the different domain areas and methodological progress in Telemedicine that occurred during the pandemic, and applied a text mining technique to understand the intensities of the terms expressed by the analyzed studies. The results show that while telemedicine has not been extensively used, a greater percentage of the studies report that telemedicine was effective. Approximately 70% positive emotional valence score was found. The paper also provides an empirical discussion and recommendations for the next steps in ample adoption of telemedicine."

Keyword-based search is the standard approach, which allows users to retrieve the documents of a corpus that contain (all or some of) the words in a target list. This type of search, however, does not provide visual support to the task and is not suited to expressing complex queries or compensating for missing specifications.

METHODS: We considered the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset corpus and summarized its content by annotating the publications' abstracts using terms selected from the Unified Medical Language System and the Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease. Then, we built a co-occurrence network that includes all relevant concepts mentioned in the corpus, establishing connections when their mutual information is relevant. A sophisticated graph query engine was built to allow the identification of the best matches of graph queries on the network. It also supports partial matches and suggests potential query completions using shortest paths.
RESULTS: We built a large co-occurrence network, consisting of 128,249 entities and 47,198,965 relationships; the GRAPH-SEARCH interface allows users to explore the network by formulating or adapting graph queries; it produces a bibliography of publications, which are globally ranked; and each publication is further associated with the specific parts of the query that it explains, thereby allowing the user to understand each aspect of the matching.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach supports the process of query formulation and evidence search upon a large text corpus; it can be reapplied to any scientific domain where documents corpora and curated ontologies are made available."

Measuring AEs is necessary for quality improvement and benchmarking purposes, but current detection methods lack in accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. The growing availability of electronic health records (EHR) and the development of natural language processing techniques for encoding narrative data offer an opportunity to develop potentially better methods. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy and generalizability of using automated methods for detecting three high-incidence and high-impact AEs from EHR data: a) hospital-acquired pneumonia, b) ventilator-associated event and, c) central line-associated bloodstream infection.
METHODS: This validation study will be conducted among medical, surgical and ICU patients admitted between 2013 and 2016 to the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) and the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), which has both French and English sites. A random 60% sample of CHUS patients will be used for model development purposes (cohort 1, development set). Using a random sample of these patients, a reference standard assessment of their medical chart will be performed. Multivariate logistic regression and the area under the curve (AUC) will be employed to iteratively develop and optimize three automated AE detection models (i.e., one per AE of interest) using EHR data from the CHUS. These models will then be validated on a random sample of the remaining 40% of CHUS patients (cohort 1, internal validation set) using chart review to assess accuracy. The most accurate models developed and validated at the CHUS will then be applied to EHR data from a random sample of patients admitted to the MUHC French site (cohort 2) and English site (cohort 3)-a critical requirement given the use of narrative data -, and accuracy will be assessed using chart review. Generalizability will be determined by comparing AUCs from cohorts 2 and 3 to those from cohort 1.
DISCUSSION: This study will likely produce more accurate and efficient measures of AEs. These measures could be used to assess the incidence rates of AEs, evaluate the success of preventive interventions, or benchmark performance across hospitals."

Because manual coding is time-consuming and has moderate reliability, we developed an algorithm called SOCcer (Standardized Occupation Coding for Computer-assisted Epidemiologic Research) to assign SOC-2010 codes based on free-text job description components.
METHODS: Job title and task-based classifiers were developed by comparing job descriptions to multiple sources linking job and task descriptions to SOC codes. An industry-based classifier was developed based on the SOC prevalence within an industry. These classifiers were used in a logistic model trained using 14 983 jobs with expert-assigned SOC codes to obtain empirical weights for an algorithm that scored each SOC/job description. We assigned the highest scoring SOC code to each job. SOCcer was validated in 2 occupational data sources by comparing SOC codes obtained from SOCcer to expert assigned SOC codes and lead exposure estimates obtained by linking SOC codes to a job-exposure matrix.
RESULTS: For 11 991 case-control study jobs, SOCcer-assigned codes agreed with 44.5% and 76.3% of manually assigned codes at the 6-digit and 2-digit level, respectively. Agreement increased with the score, providing a mechanism to identify assignments needing review. Good agreement was observed between lead estimates based on SOCcer and manual SOC assignments (κ 0.6-0.8). Poorer performance was observed for inspection job descriptions, which included abbreviations and worksite-specific terminology.
CONCLUSIONS: Although some manual coding will remain necessary, using SOCcer may improve the efficiency of incorporating occupation into large-scale epidemiological studies."

The purpose of this study is to compare the number, associated factors, and topography of CMBs between African-American and Caucasian populations in the Mid-South United States.
METHODS: Using natural language processing, we extracted all brain MRIs performed during a 2-year period (2012-2013) when the report indicated the presence of CMB. All the extracted MRI studies were evaluated for number and location of CMBs, prior stroke, and deep white matter lesion. Negative binomial regression was used to model for the overdispersed count data.
RESULTS: A total 167 patients (mean age was 63 ± 15 years, 49% men, 77% African-American, median CMB count: 8) with 1 or more CMBs on their brain MRI were included in this study. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of CMB locations (P = .086), but there was a significant difference between African-American and Caucasian patients in terms of number of CMBs (16.5 ± 18 versus 6.5 ± 5.5, P < .001). The prevalence of multiple CMBs (CMBs ≥ 5) was similar among African-Americans and Caucasians (72% versus 55%, P = .062). After adjusting for potential confounders, the African-American race was not independently associated with a higher CMB burden (P = .073).
CONCLUSION: African-American race was not independently associated with a higher rate of CMB burden when compared to Caucasians after adjusting for potential confounders. We also did not observe a significant racial difference regarding the location and prevalence of multiple CMBs (CMBs ≥ 5)."

DESIGN: Systematic review and overview of systematic reviews.
DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus for published studies and grey literature databases for unpublished studies from January 1990 to April 2018.
METHODS: To assess evidence directly addressing our objectives, we conducted a systematic review. Because we were aware of a dearth of direct evidence, we also performed an overview of systematic reviews on leisure activities that mimic formal continuing education. We a priori established the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors independently assessed inclusion and exclusion at the abstract and full-text level, rated the risk of bias, and determined the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. We resolved all discrepancies by consensus. We synthesised the available evidence narratively.
RESULTS: Our searches identified 4933 citations. For the systematic review, only two publications on the same prospective cohort study (Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project) met the inclusion criteria; for the overview of reviews, we included five systematic reviews. Based on 459 participants, preliminary data of the ongoing cohort study indicated that cognitive reserve statistically significantly increased in persons attending university classes compared with the control group (92.5% vs 55.7%, p<0.01). Likewise, language processing capacities statistically significantly improved (p<0.01). Episodic memory, working memory and executive function did not differ significantly between groups. Systematic reviews consistently reported a positive association between participation in cognitively stimulating leisure activities and reduced incidence of dementia and improved cognitive test performance.
CONCLUSION: Available results demonstrate that cognitive reserve increases through continuing education and show a positive association of cognitive leisure activities with both improved cognitive function and lower dementia incidence.

Currently, academic research lacks a comprehensive classification of work participation outcomes. The International Classification of Functioning is the foremost model in defining work functioning and its counterpart work disability, but it does not provide a critical (core) set of outcomes. Standardizing the definitions and nomenclature used in the research of work participation would ensure that the outcomes of studies are comparable, and practitioners and guideline developers can better decide what works best. As work participation is a broad umbrella term including outcome categories which need unambiguous differentiation, a framework needs to be developed first.
AIM: To propose a framework which can be used to develop a generic core outcome set for work participation.
METHODS: First, we performed a systematic literature search on the concept of (work) participation, views on how to measure it, and on existing classifications for outcome measurements. Next, we derived criteria for the framework and proposed a framework based on the criteria. Last, we applied the framework to six case studies as a proof of concept.
RESULTS: Our literature search provided 2106 hits and we selected 59 studies for full-text analysis. Based on the literature and the developed criteria we propose four overarching outcome categories: (1) initiating employment, (2) having employment, (3) increasing or maintaining productivity at work, and (4) return to employment. These categories appeared feasible in our proof-of-concept assessment with six different case studies.
CONCLUSION: We propose to use the framework for work participation outcomes to develop a core outcome set for intervention studies to improve work participation."

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SUBJECTS: Patients in the American Academy of Ophthalmology IRIS® (Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry database (2015-2021) with branch or central RVO and macular edema (ME).
METHODS: The association of demographic characteristics and presenting visual acuity (VA) with anti-VEGF treatment initiation were quantified using multivariable logistic regression.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment with ≥ 1 anti-VEGF injection within 12 months after RVO diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 304 558 eligible patients with RVO and ME were identified. Age at presentation varied by race, ethnicity, sex, and RVO type (all P values < 0.001). Within the first year after RVO presentation, 192 602 (63.2%) patients received ≥ 1 anti-VEGF injection. In a multivariable regression model adjusting for relevant covariates, female (vs. male) patients had lower odds of receiving injections (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.96; P < 0.0001) as did Black/African American (vs. White) patients (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92; P < 0.0001) and Asian (vs. White) patients (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02), whereas older patients (vs. patients aged < 51 years) had higher odds (61-70 years: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16-1.24; 71-80 years: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16-1.24; > 80 years: OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.18; all P values < 0.0001). Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic) patients had a small increased odds of treatment initiation (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11; P < 0.0001). Results were similar in the subset of 226 143 patients with VA data. In this subset, patients with presenting VA < 20/40 to 20/200 were most frequently treated in the first year after diagnosis (∼ 70%) and patients with light perception/no light perception (LP-NLP) vision or VA of 20/20 or better were treated least frequently (36.9% and 41.9%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large national clinical registry, 37% of RVO patients with ME had no anti-VEGF treatment documented in the first year after diagnosis. Black/African American, Asian, and female patients and patients with VA of LP-NLP were least likely to receive treatment. Awareness of this undertreatment and these disparities highlight the need for initiatives to ensure all RVO patients receive timely anti-VEGF injections for optimized visual outcomes.

This article is directed mainly at persons who remain in a direct therapeutic relation with a patient. It is to facilitate recognizing the needs of ill people and to increase sensitivity to the issue of maintaining or improving the well-being of patients which requires paying special attention to their psychological, social, and existential needs during the period of hindered access to the health care system. This systematic review takes advantage of quantitative and qualitative methods of text analysis with phenomenological analysis factored in. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the appearance of new problems in the population of oncological patients or it made the existing problems more severe. As a consequence, it made it significantly more difficult to meet their needs on various levels and sometimes it even made it impossible. It seems necessary to determine and introduce strategies to ensure that patients with oncological diseases have access to psychological and spiritual support in the period of the pandemic."

The goal of our work is to assess the feasibility of using electronic health records (EHRs) and automated informatics methods to efficiently validate a recent drug repurposing association of metformin with reduced cancer mortality.
METHODS: By linking two large EHRs from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Mayo Clinic to their tumor registries, we constructed a cohort including 32,415 adults with a cancer diagnosis at Vanderbilt and 79,258 cancer patients at Mayo from 1995 to 2010. Using automated informatics methods, we further identified type 2 diabetes patients within the cancer cohort and determined their drug exposure information, as well as other covariates such as smoking status. We then estimated HRs for all-cause mortality and their associated 95% CIs using stratified Cox proportional hazard models. HRs were estimated according to metformin exposure, adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, race, body mass index, tobacco use, insulin use, cancer type, and non-cancer Charlson comorbidity index.
RESULTS: Among all Vanderbilt cancer patients, metformin was associated with a 22% decrease in overall mortality compared to other oral hypoglycemic medications (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88) and with a 39% decrease compared to type 2 diabetes patients on insulin only (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.73). Diabetic patients on metformin also had a 23% improved survival compared with non-diabetic patients (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85). These associations were replicated using the Mayo Clinic EHR data. Many site-specific cancers including breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate demonstrated reduced mortality with metformin use in at least one EHR.
CONCLUSIONS: EHR data suggested that the use of metformin was associated with decreased mortality after a cancer diagnosis compared with diabetic and non-diabetic cancer patients not on metformin, indicating its potential as a chemotherapeutic regimen. This study serves as a model for robust and inexpensive validation studies for drug repurposing signals using EHR data."

METHODS: We first examined disease risk by genotypes of 9 insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using published summary genome-wide association statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP; n = 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls). We then assessed whether any SNP-disease results replicated in an independent sample derived from the Swedish Twin Registry (n = 984 cases; 10,304 controls).
RESULTS: Meta-analyses of SNP-AD results did not suggest that variation in IGF1, IGFBP3, or the molar ratio of these affect AD risk. Only one SNP appeared to affect AD risk in IGAP data. This variant is located in the gene FOXO3, implicated in human longevity. In a meta-analysis of both IGAP and secondary data, the odds ratio of AD per FOXO3 risk allele was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 1.01-1.08; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that circulating IGF1 and IGFBP3 are not important determinants of AD risk. FOXO3 function may influence AD development via pathways that are independent of IGF signaling (i.e., pleiotropic actions)."

There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age ≥37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020-that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 1427), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).
RESULTS: Through August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21).
CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that COVID-19 infection particularly during the third trimester is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth."

METHODS: All potential incident CRC cases recorded during the study period 2001 to 2014 among patients 20 to 89 years old were identified using a defined case-finding algorithm tailored to BIFAP database characteristics and based on codes plus text mining strategies. Potential CRC cases identified by the algorithm were classified into eight homogeneous groups according to recording characteristics. Random samples of 100 cases per group were obtained, and electronic medical records were manually reviewed by two independent researchers. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were estimated per each group and for the whole sample taking into account the stratified sampling. Standardized incidence rate (SIR) of CRC was estimated and compared with that reported by the National Cancer Registry. Negative predictive value (NPV) was also estimated in a random sample of 100 non-CRC patients by the algorithm.
RESULTS: A total of 17 008 potential CRC cases were identified. Most of them (14793; 87%) were recorded as incident diagnosis with linked clinical notes as free text, having this group a PPV of 92.1% (95%CI: 87.1%-95.3%). The overall PPV including all groups was 87.3% (95%CI: 83.3%-90.4%). SIR of CRC was 55.5 per 100.000 person-years. SIR increased with age and was higher in men as compared with women (77.7 vs 38.1 per 100.000 py, respectively) which were in line with those reported by the Network of Cancer Registries in Spain. NPV was of 100% (96.3%-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high validity of the CRC cases identified by the algorithm and a high level of CRC recording in BIFAP database and supports its appropriateness to validly identify incident CRC cases in BIFAP."

A systematic search was conducted in 5 databases. Data from the included studies were extracted, and the results were summarized qualitatively. The search identified 1,976 articles of which 105 were eligible for full-text analysis. 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies compared psychiatric disorder prevalence in perinatally HIV-infected children with HEU children, and only one study found a difference between the two groups. Three studies found that HEU children had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders compared with HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) children. These findings indicate that factors such as psychosocial stress, socioeconomic status, and stigma contribute to the increased risk of mental disorders in HEU children. More research is needed comparing HEU children with HUU children adjusting for potential confounders that might partially explain the higher rates seen in the HIV-exposed population.Prospero ID: CRD42020212420."

Epub 2015 Jan 29.,Hylan TR,J Pain,2015,2015/02/03,,,10.1016/j.jpain.2015.01.011,"UNLABELLED: Identification of patients at increased risk for problem opioid use is recommended by chronic opioid therapy (COT) guidelines, but clinical assessment of risks often does not occur on a timely basis. This research assessed whether structured electronic health record (EHR) data could accurately predict subsequent problem opioid use. This research was conducted among 2,752 chronic noncancer pain patients initiating COT (≥70 days' supply of an opioid in a calendar quarter) during 2008 to 2010. Patients were followed through the end of 2012 or until disenrollment from the health plan, whichever was earlier. Baseline risk indicators were derived from structured EHR data for a 2-year period prior to COT initiation. Problem opioid use after COT initiation was assessed by reviewing clinician-documented problem opioid use in EHR clinical notes identified using natural language processing techniques followed by computer-assisted manual review of natural language processing-positive clinical notes. Multivariate analyses in learning and validation samples assessed prediction of subsequent problem opioid use. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c-statistic) for problem opioid use was .739 (95% confidence interval = .688, .790) in the validation sample. A measure of problem opioid use derived from a simple weighted count of risk indicators was found to be comparably predictive of the natural language processing measure of problem opioid use, with 60% sensitivity and 72% specificity for a weighted count of ≥4 risk indicators.
PERSPECTIVE: An automated surveillance method utilizing baseline risk indicators from structured EHR data was moderately accurate in identifying COT patients who had subsequent problem opioid use."

Hospital staff had to cope with exceptional circumstances which made them vulnerable to detrimental effects on their own health. This paper describes the method that was selected for the survey entitled ""ECHOS de Nice 14 Juillet"" which aimed to assess the impact of the attack on the psychological, psycho-traumatic and somatic health condition of the Nice University and Lenval hospital staff who were directly or indirectly exposed to the attack, and also to describe the support and care facilities they were offered.
METHOD: ECHOS de Nice 14 juillet is an observational, cross-sectional, multicentre study focusing on all the hospital staff and students of both institutions, i.e. 10,100 persons in June 2017. A web-based questionnaire based on the model developed by Santé Publique France (IMPACTS and ESPA 13 novembre 2015) was adapted to the contexts of the healthcare professionals and students employed in these healthcare institutions in Nice and published on line from June 21 to October 30, 2017. The paper describes the tools that were used to meet the aims of the study, i.e. identification of exposure categories ('civilian' exposure for those present during the attack and/or 'professional' exposure); indicators of psychological impact (anxiety, depression, burnout, compassion fatigue, suicidal states, tobacco and alcohol use, self-medications), psycho-traumatic and somatic impact; professional and social impact. Lastly, awareness of availability and use of psychological support and care-follow-up facilities by professionals were investigated. Respondents could include extensive qualitative comments on the various themes explored in the questionnaire, with text analysis complementing that of quantitative data.
DISCUSSION: The benefits and limitations of the selected methodology are discussed, in view of contributing useful information to help anticipate and manage health issues among hospital staff who have been victims of traumatic events."

The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of required in-person dermatologist care in the presence or absence of certain clinical features. Methods: Observational cross-sectional study of 11,661 teledermatology reports made from February 2017 to March 2020. Results: The need for dermoscopy was associated with a 348% increase in the possibility of referral for in-person dermatologist evaluations (prevalence ratio [PR]: 4.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.17-4.82). Infectious diseases were associated with a 64% lower possibility of referral (PR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.30-0.43). Discussion: Some lesions and poorly documented cases are challenging to assess remotely. This study presents a different approach to research more detailed data from teledermatology reports, using text mining, and points out the risk magnitude for demanding dermatologic in-person care of which feature analyzed. As limitations, the variables related to lesion location, size, and extension were not analyzed and the dictionaries used were originally in Brazilian Portuguese. Conclusions: Teledermatology seems sufficient for the management of 75% of clinical cases, especially acute in young patients with inflammatory or infectious lesions. Referrals for in-person dermatologist consultations were not only strongly associated with the need for dermoscopy, but also for therapeutic reasons like surgical procedures, phototherapy, and the use of some systemic medications."

METHODS: Cox models and logistic regression were used to analyze data from a nation-wide cohort in Spain. LP is defined as being diagnosed when CD4 < 350 cells/ml or AIDS.
RESULTS: Of 7165 new HIV diagnoses, 46.9% (CI95%:45.7-48.0) were LP, 240 patients died. First-year mortality was the highest (aHRLP.vs.nLP = 10.3[CI95%:5.5-19.3]); between 1 and 4 years post-diagnosis, aHRLP.vs.nLP = 1.9(1.2-3.0); and >4 years, aHRLP.vs.nLP = 1.5(0.7-3.1). First-year's main cause of death was HIV/AIDS (73%); and malignancies among those surviving >4 years (32%). HIV/AIDS-related deaths were more likely in LP (59.2% vs. 25.0%; p < 0.001). LP declined from 55.9% (2004-05) to 39.4% (2012-13), and reduced in 46.1% in men who have sex with men (MSM) and 37.6% in heterosexual men, but increased in 22.6% in heterosexual women. Factors associated with LP: sex (ORMEN.vs.WOMEN = 1.4[1.2-1.7]); age (OR31-40.vs.<30 = 1.6[1.4-1.8], OR41-50.vs.<30 = 2.2[1.8-2.6], OR>50.vs.<30 = 3.6[2.9-4.4]); behavior (ORInjectedDrugUse.vs.MSM = 2.8[2.0-3.8]; ORHeterosexual.vs.MSM = 2.2[1.7-3.0]); education (ORPrimaryEducation.vs.University = 1.5[1.1-2.0], ORLowerSecondary.vs.University = 1.3[1.1-1.5]); and geographical origin (ORSub-Saharan.vs.Spain = 1.6[1.3-2.0], ORLatin-American.vs.Spain = 1.4[1.2-1.8]).
CONCLUSIONS: LP is associated with higher mortality, especially short-term- and HIV/AIDS-related mortality. Mid-term-, but not long-term mortality, remained also higher in LP than nLP. LP decreased in MSM and heterosexual men, not in heterosexual women. The groups most affected by LP are low educated, non-Spanish and heterosexual women."

Spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a professional obligation of every healthcare professionals (HCPs). The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the existing literature about the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) level of HCPs regarding PV and ADRs reporting in Turkey.
METHODS: A systematic and comprehensive articles search strategy was carried out in different seven electronic databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Goggle Scholar, Ovid-SP, MEDLINE, Wiley Online Library, DergiPark) from 2010 to 2020. We searched to identify existing literature about cross-sectional observational studies investigating the KAP of HCPs regarding PV and ADRs reporting in different geographical regions of Turkey. Quality assessment and risk of bias were assessed among included studies.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were chosen for full-text analysis. Finally, according to inclusion criteria, seven research articles were selected for systematic review. Overall, the KAP of HCPs varies across the studies. The lack of a standardized validated measuring tool to evaluate the KAP and differences in questionnaire items were the main limitations in included studies. Around, 69.1% (range: 54.6-100%) of HCPs were not aware of the national pharmacovigilance center in Turkey. About, 37.5% (range: 7.1-75.7%) of HCPs believed that reporting of ADRs is not important and 87.5% (range: 69.3-100%) stated that they never reported ADR previously during their practice. The most frequently highlighted barriers to PV were lack of time, uncertainty and did not know where to report.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review revealed a major KAP gap in Turkey towards PV activities. Low ADR reporting practice of HCPs was a major identified issue. The creation of a mandatory unified PV education intervention for future HCPs to rationally report ADR of drugs are crucial for a better healthcare system."

The purpose of this systematic review of systematic reviews was to assess the impact of mandibular advancement or bimaxillary surgeries on condylar resorption. A literature search, using several electronic databases, was carried out by two reviewers independently. Article preselection was based on titles and abstracts, and final article selection based on full-text analysis of preselected studies. After final study selection, the quality of studies was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. A decision algorithm was subsequently established to choose the best body of evidence. From an initial yield of 1'848 articles, 23 systematic reviews were identified for further analysis, with ten studies being included in the final selection. Despite the generally low quality of the reviews, certain associations could be made: young patients, female patients, and those with a high mandibular plane angle are more prone to condylar resorption following mandibular advancement osteotomies, especially if anterior rotation of the mandible is performed during surgery. Patients undergoing bimaxillary surgery also appear to have a higher risk of developing condylar resorption. In conclusion, these results confirm the multi-factorial nature of condylar resorption, stressing the need for well-controlled prospective studies with long-term follow-up to clearly identify potential risk factors associated with orthognathic surgery."

OBJECTIVES: To describe the post-bAVR antithrombotic medication practice across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and to assess the association between antithrombotic strategies and post-bAVR outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study. Multivariable modeling with propensity scores was conducted to adjust for differences in patient characteristics across the 3 most common antithrombotic medication strategies (aspirin plus warfarin sodium, aspirin only, and dual antiplatelets). Text mining of notes was used to identify the patients with bAVR (fiscal years 2005-2015).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This study used VHA and non-VHA outpatient pharmacy data and text notes to classify the following antithrombotic medications prescribed within 1 week after discharge from the bAVR hospitalization: aspirin plus warfarin, aspirin only, dual antiplatelets, no antithrombotics, other only, and warfarin only. The 90-day outcomes included all-cause mortality, thromboembolism risk, and bleeding events. Outcomes were identified using primary diagnosis codes from emergency department visits or hospital admissions.
RESULTS: The cohort included 9060 veterans with bAVR at 47 facilities (mean [SD] age, 69.3 [8.8] years; 98.6% male). The number of bAVR procedures per year increased from 610 in fiscal year 2005 to 1072 in fiscal year 2015. The most commonly prescribed antithrombotic strategy was aspirin only (4240 [46.8%]), followed by aspirin plus warfarin (1638 [18.1%]), no antithrombotics (1451 [16.0%]), dual antiplatelets (1010 [11.1%]), warfarin only (439 [4.8%]), and other only (282 [3.1%]). Facility variation in antithrombotic prescription patterns was observed. During the 90-day post-bAVR period, adverse events were uncommon, including all-cause mortality in 127 (1.4%), thromboembolism risk in 142 (1.6%), and bleeding events in 149 (1.6%). No differences in 90-day mortality or thromboembolism were identified across the 3 antithrombotic medication groups in either the unadjusted or adjusted models. Patients receiving the combination of aspirin plus warfarin had higher odds of bleeding than patients receiving aspirin only in the unadjusted analysis (odds ratio, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.71-3.89) and after full risk adjustment (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.17-3.14).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data demonstrate that bAVR procedures are increasingly being performed in VHA facilities and that aspirin only was the most commonly used antithrombotic medication strategy after bAVR. The risk-adjusted results suggest that the combination of aspirin plus warfarin does not improve either all-cause mortality or thromboembolism risk but increases the risk of bleeding events compared with aspirin only."

This systematic review evaluates the prevalence of DDI among people receiving antiretrovirals across 3 decades.
METHODS: We searched 3 databases for studies reporting the prevalence of clinically significant DDIs in patients receiving antiretrovirals published between January 1987 and July 2022. Clinically significant DDIs were graded by severity. All data extractions were undertaken by 2 independent reviewers, adjudicated by a third.
RESULTS: Of 21,665 records returned, 13,474 were duplicates. After screening the remaining 13,596 abstracts against inclusion criteria, 122 articles were included for full-text analysis, from which a final list of 34 articles were included for data synthesis. The proportion of patients experiencing a clinically significant DDI did not change over time (P = 0.072). The most frequently reported classes of antiretrovirals involved in DDIs were protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; of note, integrase use in the most recent studies was highly variable and ranged between 0% and 89%.
CONCLUSIONS: The absolute risk of DDIs has not decreased over the period covered. This is likely related to continued use of older regimens and an ageing cohort of patients. A greater reduction in DDI prevalence can be anticipated with broader uptake of regimens containing unboosted integrase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors."

The primary objective of this literature review was to compare manual and computer software using artificial intelligence retrieval of publications on the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS, but we also evaluated the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in primary SS.
METHODS: We compared manual searching and searching with the in-house computer software BIbliography BOT (BIBOT) designed for article retrieval and analysis. Both methods were used for a systematic literature review on a complex topic, i.e. the cutaneous manifestations of primary SS. Reproducibility was estimated by computing Cohen's κ coefficients and was interpreted as follows: slight, 0-0.20; fair, 0.21-0.40; moderate, 0.41-0.60; substantial, 0.61-0.80; and almost perfect, 0.81-1.
RESULTS: The manual search retrieved 855 articles and BIBOT 1042 articles. In all, 202 articles were then selected by applying exclusion criteria. Among them, 155 were retrieved by both methods, 33 by manual search only, and 14 by BIBOT only. Reliability (κ = 0.84) was almost perfect. Further selection was performed by reading the 202 articles. Cohort sizes and the nature and prevalence of cutaneous manifestations varied across publications. In all, we found 52 cutaneous manifestations reported in primary SS patients. The most described ones were cutaneous vasculitis (561 patients), xerosis (651 patients) and annular erythema (215 patients).
CONCLUSION: Among the final selection of 202 articles, 155/202 (77%) were found by the two methods but BIBOT was faster and automatically classified the articles in a chart. Combining the two methods retrieved the largest number of publications."

Epub 2024 Nov 6.,Sudri K,Circ Cardiovasc Interv,2024,2024/11/06,,,10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.124.014201,"BACKGROUND: While clinical practice guidelines advocate for multidisciplinary heart team (MDHT) discussions in coronary revascularization, variability in implementation across health care settings remains a challenge. This variability could potentially be addressed by language learning models like ChatGPT, offering decision-making support in diverse health care environments. Our study aims to critically evaluate the concordance between recommendations made by MDHT and those generated by language learning models in coronary revascularization decision-making.
METHODS: From March 2023 to July 2023, consecutive coronary angiography cases (n=86) that were referred for revascularization (either percutaneous or surgical) were analyzed using both ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4. Case presentation formats included demographics, medical background, detailed description of angiographic findings, and SYNTAX score (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery; I and II), which were presented in 3 different formats. The recommendations of the models were compared with those of an MDHT.
RESULTS: ChatGPT-4 showed high concordance with decisions made by the MDHT (accuracy 0.82, sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.83, and kappa 0.59), while ChatGPT-3.5 (0.67, 0.27, 0.84, and 0.12, respectively) showed lower concordance. Entropy and Fleiss kappa of ChatGPT-4 were 0.09 and 0.9, respectively, indicating high reliability and repeatability. The best correlation between ChatGPT-4 and MDHT was achieved when clinical cases were presented in a detailed context. Specific subgroups of patients yielded high accuracy (>0.9) of ChatGPT-4, including those with left main disease, 3 vessel disease, and diabetic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that advanced language learning models like ChatGPT-4 may be able to predict clinical recommendations for coronary artery disease revascularization with reasonable accuracy, especially in specific patient groups, underscoring their potential role as a supportive tool in clinical decision-making."

RESULTS: After deduplication, appraisal of abstract titles and full-text analysis of 1441 articles, 42 articles with 3351 COVID-19 patients were included in this review. Of these, 412 conjunctival swabs/Schirmer paper strips tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity of the RT-PCR tests across the 24 studies with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients was 10.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 10 RT-PCR tests performed on conjunctival swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is likely present and detectable in the conjunctiva, this detection method has low diagnostic potential."

This study aimed to conduct a review of reviews to examine existing and validated instruments measuring the ability of older persons to build and maintain social relationships and to evaluate the psychometric properties of these instruments.
METHODS: We searched for studies published in the English, Spanish and Portuguese languages. No restrictions were placed on the year of publication. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Psyinfo and Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Titles and abstracts were screened and selected articles were screened and reviewed independently by two reviewers.
RESULTS: A total of 3,879 records were retrieved, of which 39 records were retrieved for full-text analysis. None of the reviews met the inclusion criteria, thus resulting in an empty review.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the current definition of older persons' functional ability to build and maintain social relationships, this review did not identify instruments that can measure both constructs simultaneously. We suggest the development of an instrument that simultaneously assesses the ability of older persons to build and maintain relationships."

However, the relationship between TL and common metabolic risk factors for CHD is not well understood. Whether these risk factors could explain pathways from TL to CHD warrants further attention.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether metabolic risk factors for CHD mediate the causal pathway from short TL to increased risk of CHD using a network Mendelian randomization design.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Summary statistics from several genome-wide association studies were used in a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study design. Network Mendelian randomization analysis-an approach using genetic variants as the instrumental variables for both the exposure and mediator to infer causality-was performed to examine the causal association between telomeres and CHD and metabolic risk factors. Summary statistics from the ENGAGE Telomere Consortium were used (n=37 684) as a TL genetic instrument, CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium data were used (case=22 233 and control=64 762) for CHD, and other consortia data were used for metabolic traits (fasting insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus, glycohemoglobin, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist:hip ratio). One-unit increase of genetically determined TL was associated with -0.07 (95% confidence interval, -0.01 to -0.12; P=0.01) lower log-transformed fasting insulin (pmol/L) and 21% lower odds (95% confidence interval, 3-35; P=0.02) of CHD. Higher genetically determined log-transformed fasting insulin level was associated with higher CHD risk (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-3.41; P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support a role of insulin as a mediator on the causal pathway from shorter telomeres to CHD pathogenesis."
38805611,A Bayesian System to Detect and Track Outbreaks of Influenza-Like Illnesses Including Novel Diseases: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Aronis JM, Ye Y, Espino J, Hochheiser H, Michaels MG, Cooper GF.",JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2024 Aug 13;10:e57349. doi: 10.2196/57349.,Aronis JM,JMIR Public Health Surveill,2024,2024/05/28,PMC11350309,,10.2196/57349,"BACKGROUND:  The early identification of outbreaks of both known and novel influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) is an important public health problem.
OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to describe the design and testing of a tool that detects and tracks outbreaks of both known and novel ILIs, such as the SARS-CoV-2 worldwide pandemic, accurately and early.
METHODS:  This paper describes the ILI Tracker algorithm that first models the daily occurrence of a set of known ILIs in hospital emergency departments in a monitored region using findings extracted from patient care reports using natural language processing. We then show how the algorithm can be extended to detect and track the presence of an unmodeled disease that may represent a novel disease outbreak.
RESULTS:  We include results based on modeling diseases like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza for 5 emergency departments in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from June 1, 2014, to May 31, 2015. We also include the results of detecting the outbreak of an unmodeled disease, which in retrospect was very likely an outbreak of the enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).
CONCLUSIONS:  The results reported in this paper provide support that ILI Tracker was able to track well the incidence of 4 modeled influenza-like diseases over a 1-year period, relative to laboratory-confirmed cases, and it was computationally efficient in doing so. The system was also able to detect a likely novel outbreak of EV-D68 early in an outbreak that occurred in Allegheny County in 2014 as well as clinically characterize that outbreak disease accurately."
37883757,Effect of Adopting Low Calories on Patients' Vital Signs in The Nutritional Support of Critically Ill Patients in the ICU: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis,"Jiang Q, Duan L.",Altern Ther Health Med. 2024 Mar;30(3):156-166.,Jiang Q,Altern Ther Health Med,2024,2023/10/26,,,,"BACKGROUND: Feeding critically ill persons in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is challenging as the nutritional substances pose severe health outcomes or can improve their well-being and length of stay (LOS) in the hospital. Our main objective is to investigate the effects of adopting low caloric intake among patients with vital signs in the nutritional support of critically ill patients in ICUs, focusing on reducing mortality rates and length of stay (LOS) in hospitals.
METHOD: The initial literature search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library of Trials, and MEDLINE. The network meta-analysis was performed per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two independent reviewers were assigned data selection and extraction roles. Our study mainly included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) whose titles and abstracts were screened, after which duplicates were excluded. The remaining eligible studies were subjected to full-text analysis to identify data related to the topic of the present study. Analyses were performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, R software and MS Excel.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (involving 9 539 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were subjected to the network meta-analysis. In mortality rates, the greatest rank observed corresponded to a reduction of 71%. The regression of the effects of low caloric intake explained a 5.29% variation in LOS. A weak positive correlation was found between LOS and low caloric intake among critically ill patients in ICUs. Thus, Low caloric intake decreased mortality rates and lowered LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that low caloric intake reduces mortality rate and hospital LOS among critically ill patients. Secondary outcomes include nosocomial infection, clinical outcomes, functions, digestive infections, improved quality of life, resulting survival rates, ventilator days, bacteremia, blood glucose levels, diarrhoea, and tube replacement. Our findings have clinical implications for clinicians in the ICU, who should consider developing individualised nutritional plans for critically ill patients. Moreover, regular monitoring of nutritional intake and response is crucial. Healthcare providers should closely monitor patients' nutritional status, vital signs, and clinical outcomes."
35593186,Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19,"Struyf T, Deeks JJ, Dinnes J, Takwoingi Y, Davenport C, Leeflang MM, Spijker R, Hooft L, Emperador D, Domen J, Tans A, Janssens S, Wickramasinghe D, Lannoy V, Horn SRA, Van den Bruel A; Cochrane COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2022 May 20;5(5):CD013665. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD013665.pub3.,Struyf T,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2022,2022/05/20,PMC9121352,,10.1002/14651858.CD013665.pub3,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 illness is highly variable, ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and life-threatening consequences. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), can help flag early on if the disease is present. Such information could be used either to rule out COVID-19 disease, or to identify people who need to go for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.
SEARCH METHODS: We undertook electronic searches up to 10 June 2021 in the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents. We did not apply any language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected COVID-19, or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and also controls without COVID-19 from a single-gate cohort. Studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies that included people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract, and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Analyses were restricted to prospective studies only. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary prospective studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 90 studies; for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52,608 participants. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 3.7% to 60.6% with a median of 27.4%. Thirty-five studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres (46,878 participants), three in primary care settings (1230 participants), two in a mixed population of in- and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting (493 participants), and two overlapping studies in nursing homes (4007 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID-19 disease from COVID-19 pneumonia, so we present the results for both conditions together. Twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was needed, or because they enrolled a non-consecutive sample, or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base. We rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how, by whom and when, the symptoms were measured. For most studies, eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study, meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review. The applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews. This version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings, which is where the majority of assessments for COVID-19 take place. Only three studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms. Evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported, so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. RT-PCR was the most often used reference standard (40/42 studies). Only cough (11 studies) had a summary sensitivity above 50% (62.4%, 95% CI 50.6% to 72.9%)); its specificity was low (45.4%, 95% CI 33.5% to 57.9%)). Presence of fever had a sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI 23.4% to 54.3%) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI 56.3% to 87.8%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and that of fever 1.52 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.10). Sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0.814 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.929), which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than COVID-19. Dyspnoea (12 studies) and fatigue (8 studies) had a sensitivity of 23.3% (95% CI 16.4% to 31.9%) and 40.2% (95% CI 19.4% to 65.1%) respectively. Their specificity was 75.7% (95% CI 65.2% to 83.9%) and 73.6% (95% CI 48.4% to 89.3%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11) and that of fatigue 1.52 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.91), which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having COVID-19. Anosmia alone (7 studies), ageusia alone (5 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had summary sensitivities below 50% but summary specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 26.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 44.6%) and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 96.5%). Ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 23.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 43.3%) and a specificity of 92.6% (95% CI 83.1% to 97.0%). Anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 39.2% (95% CI 26.5% to 53.6%) and a specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 84.5% to 96.2%). The summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.55 (95% CI 3.46 to 5.97) and 4.99 (95% CI 3.22 to 7.75) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 3.14 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.51). Twenty-four studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining olfactory symptoms. By combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history, age, gender, and a local recent case detection rate, some multivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90%.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy. Neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID-19. The presence of cough also supports further testing. There is currently no evidence to support further testing with PCR in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, coryza or rhinorrhoea. Combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact or travel history, or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. The diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for COVID-19 is moderate to low and any testing strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing. Which one of these is minimised, is determined by the goal of COVID-19 testing strategies, that is, controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis. The former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing, the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia."

METHODS: BERTopic (a topic modeling technique) was employed with human validations to analyze mpox-related tweets (n = 8,688; October 2020-September 2022) from 2,326 self-identified SMMGD individuals in the U.S.; followed by content analysis and geographic analysis.
RESULTS: BERTopic identified 11 topics: health activism (29.81%); mpox vaccination (25.81%) and adverse events (0.98%); sarcasm, jokes, emotional expressions (14.04%); COVID-19 and mpox (7.32%); government/public health response (6.12%); mpox symptoms (2.74%); case reports (2.21%); puns on the virus' naming (i.e., monkeypox; 0.86%); media publicity (0.68%); mpox in children (0.67%). Mpox health activism negatively correlated with LGB social climate index at U.S. state level, ρ = -0.322, p = 0.031.
CONCLUSIONS: SMMGD discussions on mpox encompassed utilitarian (e.g., vaccine access, case reports, mpox symptoms) and emotionally-charged themes-advocating against homophobia, misinformation, and stigma. Mpox health activism was more prevalent in states with lower LGB social acceptance.
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Findings illuminate SMMGD engagement with mpox discourse, underscoring the need for more inclusive health communication strategies in infectious disease outbreaks to control associated stigma."

Epub 2015 Jan 29.,Kadlecová P,Stroke,2015,2015/01/31,,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006724,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although alcohol-stroke association is well known, the age-varying effect of alcohol drinking at midlife on subsequent stroke risk across older adulthood has not been examined. The effect of genetic/early-life factors is also unknown. We used cohort and twin analyses of data with 43 years of follow-up for stroke incidence to help address these gaps.
METHODS: All 11 644 members of the population-based Swedish Twin Registry born 1886 to 1925 with alcohol data aged ≤60 years were included. The interaction of midlife alcohol consumption by age at stroke was evaluated in Cox-regression and analyses of monozygotic twins were used. Covariates were baseline age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, stress reactivity, depression, body mass index, smoking, and exercise.
RESULTS: Altogether 29% participants developed stroke. Compared with very-light drinkers (<0.5 drink/d), heavy drinkers (>2 drinks/d) had greater risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.34; P=0.02) and the effect for nondrinkers approached significance (hazard ratio, 1.11; P=0.08). Age increased stroke risk for nondrinkers (P=0.012) and decreased it for heavy drinkers (P=0.040). Midlife heavy drinkers were at high risk from baseline until the age of 75 years when hypertension and diabetes mellitus grew to being the more relevant risk factors. In analyses of monozygotic twin-pairs, heavy drinking shortened time to stroke by 5 years (P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke-risk associated with heavy drinking (>2 drinks/d) in midlife seems to predominate over well-known risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, until the age of ≈75 years and may shorten time to stroke by 5 years above and beyond covariates and genetic/early-life factors. Alcohol consumption should be considered an age-varying risk factor for stroke."

Although patients with 22q11.2DS are at substantially higher risk for comorbid TDD, it remains underdiagnosed within 22q11.2DS, likely due to overlapping symptomatology and a lack of knowledge about TDD. Initiation of B-vitamin supplementation may provide therapeutic benefit in TDD, highlighting the need for effective screening methods to improve diagnosis rates in this at-risk group. In this retrospective, multicenter study, we evaluated two cohorts of patients with 22q11.2DS (total N = 435) for possible comorbid TDD using two different symptom-based screening methods (free text-mining and manual chart review versus manual chart review alone). The methodology of the cohort 1 screening method successfully identified a known 22q11.2DS patient with TDD. Combined, these two cohorts identified 21 living patients meeting the consensus recommendation for TANGO2 testing for suspected comorbid TDD. Of the nine patients undergoing TANGO2 sequencing with del/dup analysis, none were ultimately diagnosed with TDD. Of the 12 deaths in the suspected comorbid TDD cohort, some of these patients exhibited symptoms (rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmia, or metabolic crisis) suspicious of comorbid TDD contributing to their death. Collectively, these findings highlight the need for robust prospective screening tools for diagnosing comorbid TDD in patients with 22q11.2DS."
31786810,Transient neurological symptoms (TNS) following spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine versus other local anaesthetics in adult surgical patients: a network meta-analysis,"Forget P, Borovac JA, Thackeray EM, Pace NL.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2019 Dec 1;12(12):CD003006. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD003006.pub4.,Forget P,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2019,2019/12/02,PMC6885375,,10.1002/14651858.CD003006.pub4,"BACKGROUND: Spinal anaesthesia has been implicated as one of the possible causes of neurological complications following surgical procedures. This painful condition, occurring during the immediate postoperative period, is termed transient neurological symptoms (TNS) and is typically observed after the use of spinal lidocaine. Alternatives to lidocaine that can provide high-quality anaesthesia without TNS development are needed. This review was originally published in 2005, and last updated in 2009.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of TNS after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine and compare it with other types of local anaesthetics by performing a meta-analysis for all pair-wise comparisons, and conducting network meta-analysis (NMA) to rank interventions.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Elsevier Embase, and LILACS on 25 November 2018. We searched clinical trial registries and handsearched the reference lists of trials and review articles.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the frequency of TNS after spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine to other local anaesthetics. Studies had to have two or more arms that used distinct local anaesthetics (irrespective of the concentration and baricity of the solution) for spinal anaesthesia in preparation for surgery. We included adults who received spinal anaesthesia and considered all pregnant participants as a subgroup. The follow-up period for TNS was at least 24 hours.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Three review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted the data from the included studies. We performed meta-analysis for all pair-wise comparisons of local anaesthetics, as well as NMA. We used an inverse variance weighting for summary statistics and a random-effects model as we expected methodological and clinical heterogeneity across the included studies resulting in varying effect sizes between studies of pair-wise comparisons. The NMA used all included studies based on a graph theoretical approach within a frequentist framework. Finally, we ranked the competing treatments by P scores.
MAIN RESULTS: The analysis included 24 trials reporting on 2226 participants of whom 239 developed TNS. Two studies are awaiting classification and one is ongoing. Included studies mostly had unclear to high risk of bias. The NMA included 24 studies and eight different local anaesthetics; the number of pair-wise comparisons was 32 and the number of different pair-wise comparisons was 11. This analysis showed that, compared to lidocaine, the risk ratio (RR) of TNS was lower for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine with RRs in the range of 0.10 to 0.23 while 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine did not differ in terms of RR of TNS development compared to lidocaine. Pair-wise meta-analysis showed that compared with lidocaine, most local anaesthetics were associated with a reduced risk of TNS development (except 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine) (bupivacaine: RR 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.28; 12 studies; moderate-quality evidence; 2-chloroprocaine: RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.51; 2 studies; low-quality evidence; levobupivacaine: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.69; 2 studies; low-quality evidence; mepivacaine: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.18 to 5.82; 4 studies; very low-quality evidence; prilocaine: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence; procaine: RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.52; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence; ropivacaine: RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.78; 2 studies; low-quality evidence). We were unable to perform any of our planned subgroup analyses due to the low number of TNS events.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from both NMA and pair-wise meta-analysis indicate that the risk of developing TNS after spinal anaesthesia is lower when bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, and ropivacaine are used compared to lidocaine. The use of 2-chloroprocaine and mepivacaine had a similar risk to lidocaine in terms of TNS development after spinal anaesthesia. Patients should be informed of TNS as a possible adverse effect of local anaesthesia with lidocaine and the choice of anaesthetic agent should be based on the specific clinical context and parameters such as the expected duration of the procedure and the quality of anaesthesia. Due to the very low- to moderate-quality evidence (GRADE), future research efforts in this field are required to assess alternatives to lidocaine that would be able to provide high-quality anaesthesia without TNS development. The two studies awaiting classification and one ongoing study may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed."

Epub 2023 Nov 7.,Wang AY,Cerebrovasc Dis,2024,2023/11/07,,,10.1159/000534581,"BACKGROUND: Covert cerebrovascular disease (CCD) includes white matter disease (WMD) and covert brain infarction (CBI). Incidentally discovered CCD is associated with an increased risk of subsequent symptomatic stroke. However, it is unknown whether the severity of WMD or the location of CBI predicts risk.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the association of incidentally discovered WMD severity and CBI location with a risk of subsequent symptomatic stroke.
METHOD: This retrospective cohort study includes patients ≥50 years old from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California health system who received neuroimaging for a nonstroke indication between 2009 and 2019. Incidental CBI and WMD were identified via natural language processing of the neuroimage report, and WMD severity was classified into grades.
RESULTS: 261,960 patients received neuroimaging, 78,555 (30.0%) were identified to have incidental WMD, and 12,857 were identified (4.9%) to have incidental CBI. Increasing WMD severity is associated with the increased incidence rate of future stroke. However, the stroke incidence rate in CT-identified WMD is higher at each level of severity compared to rates in MRI-identified WMD. Patients with mild WMD via CT have a stroke incidence rate of 24.9 per 1,000 person-years, similar to that of patients with severe WMD via MRI. Among incidentally discovered CBI patients with a determined CBI location, 97.9% have subcortical infarcts rather than cortical infarcts. CBI confers a similar risk of future stroke, whether cortical or subcortical, or whether MRI detected or CT detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing severity of incidental WMD is associated with an increased risk of future symptomatic stroke, dependent on the imaging modality. Subcortical and cortical CBI conferred similar risks."

Epub 2023 Dec 18.,Majid SZ,Clin Imaging,2024,2024/01/17,,,10.1016/j.clinimag.2023.110063,"OBJECTIVE: To compare imaging features of interval cancers detected in patients screened with full field digital mammography (FFDM) versus digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).
MATERIALS/METHODS: This retrospective observational study consisted of female patients undergoing screening DM or FFDM at an academic medical center and two outpatient imaging facilities between January 2012 and June 2017. A natural language processing algorithm queried breast imaging reports for breast density and BI-RADS category. This was cross-referenced to an institutional breast cancer registry to identify interval cancers. Retrospective consensus review of the cases was done to categorize imaging features of interval cancers on FFDM vs DBT.
RESULTS: The rate of interval cancers was comparable in patients screened with FFDM (30/39793) and DBT (29/32180) (p = 0.58). There was no significant difference in the rate, histopathology, or imaging features of interval cancers in patients screened with FFDM versus DBT. The most common mammographic features on diagnostic imaging across both groups was the presence of a mass (13/47). Almost equally common was negative diagnostic mammogram with mass detected only on ultrasound (11/47). The rate of interval cancers detected by high-risk surveillance breast MRI was increased in patients who previously had screening with DBT relative to those who had screening with FFDM (p = 0.0419).
CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in rate of detection, histopathology, or imaging features of interval cancers in patients screened with FFDM versus DBT. However, across both cohorts, the most common features on diagnostic mammogram were either the presence of a mass or a negative mammogram."

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes."

This article addresses the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome.
SUMMARY: Behavioral manifestations of mania may be more obvious than affective symptoms, especially in patients with aprosodia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are often first-line acute treatments, but the evidence supporting their long-term prophylactic efficacy is questionable. In addition to being an established mood stabilizer, lithium has putative neuroprotective properties, although a side effect can be impaired memory."

It is characterized by progressive inflammation and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. A comprehensive analysis at temporal, spatial and population levels with the most updated data from GBD 2019 is provided in this study to estimate the disease burden of silicosis from 1990 to 2019 and make predictions to 2029.
METHODS: We delineated silicosis data on incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as well as age-standardized rates (ASRs) across 30 years from GBD 2019. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to detect temporal changes and estimate annual percentage change (APC) of each trend segment. Measures were stratified by time, location, age, and sociodemographic index (SDI). Back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model was applied to elaborate ASR trends from 1990 to 2019 and projections to the next 10 years.
RESULTS: Globally, silicosis incident, prevalent cases, and DALYs increased by 64.6%, 91.4%, and 20.8%, respectively. However, all the corresponding ASRs showed overall downward trends with an estimated average APC (AAPC) of -0.5(-0.7 to -0.3), -0.2(-0.5 to 0.0), and - 2.0(-2.2 to -1.8), respectively. Middle and high-middle SDI regions carried the heaviest disease burden. The highest disease burden of silicosis was mainly transferred to the older from 1990 to 2019. The trend of ASRs demonstrated a rapid decline between 2005 and 2019, followed by a continuous decline until 2029.
CONCLUSION: Though disease burden of silicosis has been on a decline in general from 1990 to 2019, which shows a promising prospect but cannot be ignored. We should pay more attention to implementing preventive tactics and improving the life quality of present sufferers."

METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, single-blind, controlled trial at 36 centers in 13 countries. Patients scheduled to undergo elective CABG were randomly assigned to an intraoperative anesthetic regimen that included a volatile anesthetic (desflurane, isoflurane, or sevoflurane) or to total intravenous anesthesia. The primary outcome was death from any cause at 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 5400 patients were randomly assigned: 2709 to the volatile anesthetics group and 2691 to the total intravenous anesthesia group. On-pump CABG was performed in 64% of patients, with a mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass of 79 minutes. The two groups were similar with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the number of grafts. At the time of the second interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board advised that the trial should be stopped for futility. No significant difference between the groups with respect to deaths from any cause was seen at 1 year (2.8% in the volatile anesthetics group and 3.0% in the total intravenous anesthesia group; relative risk, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.29; P = 0.71), with data available for 5353 patients (99.1%), or at 30 days (1.4% and 1.3%, respectively; relative risk, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.76), with data available for 5398 patients (99.9%). There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the secondary outcomes or in the incidence of prespecified adverse events, including myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing elective CABG, anesthesia with a volatile agent did not result in significantly fewer deaths at 1 year than total intravenous anesthesia. (Funded by the Italian Ministry of Health; MYRIAD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02105610.)."

RECENT FINDINGS: In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed to a microbial and inflammatory origin for Alzheimer's disease with the discovery of oral and airway bacteria, viruses, and fungal species in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, recognized as the culprit of neural network dysfunction, β-amyloid oligomeric species have antimicrobial properties reinforcing the idea that dysbiosis in the host-microbiota interaction can be at the origin of dementia. Periodontitis (gum disease), a persistent low-grade inflammatory condition, caused by pathogenic microorganisms, has been linked to an increased β-amyloid burden and cognitive disabilities later in life.
SUMMARY: The pathogens of periodontal disease and the subsequent chronic inflammatory responses have significant implications on the development of Alzheimer's disease. The exact molecular mechanism by which Porphyromonas gingivalis and periodontal disease are involved in the pathogenicity of Alzheimer's disease is not currently evident. Understanding this causality can be instrumental in the development of treatments for this yet uncurable disease."

Epub 2018 Jul 22.,Tesoriero C,Brain Res Bull,2019,2018/07/18,,,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2018.07.002,"Sleep is frequently altered in systemic infections as a component of sickness behavior in response to inflammation. Sleepiness in sickness behavior has been extensively investigated. Much less attention has instead been devoted to sleep and wake alterations in brain infections. Most of these, as other neuroinfections, are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The present overview highlights the importance of this topic from both the clinical and pathogenetic points of view. Vigilance states and their regulation are first summarized, emphasizing that key nodes in this distributed brain system can be targeted by neuroinflammatory signaling. Sleep-wake changes in the parasitic disease human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and its animal models are then reviewed and discussed. Experimental data have revealed that the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker, and peptidergic cell populations of the lateral hypothalamus (the wake-promoting orexin neurons and the sleep-promoting melanin-concentrating hormone neurons) are targeted by African trypanosome infection. It is then discussed how prominent and disturbing are sleep changes in HIV/AIDS, also when the infection is cured with antiretroviral therapy. This recalls attention on the bidirectional interactions between sleep and immune system, including the specialized brain immune response of which microglial cells are protagonists. Sleep changes in an ancient viral disease, rabies, and in the emerging infection due to Zika virus which causes a congenital syndrome, are also dealt with. Altogether the findings indicate that sleep-wake regulation is targeted by brain infections caused by different pathogens and, although the relevant pathogenetic mechanisms largely remain to be clarified, these alterations differ from hypersomnia occurring in sickness behavior. Thus, brain infections point to the vulnerability of the neural network of sleep-wake regulation as a highly relevant clinical and basic science challenge."

The purpose of this study was to review the controversies on post-COVID-19 syndrome, the frequency of neurological symptoms, and the potential pathophysiological mechanisms.
METHODS: We present a narrative review of studies published in PubMed since the beginning of the pandemic (January 2020-July 2021).
RESULTS: Patients with history of COVID-19 have been found to present persistent neurological symptoms, including cognitive complaints, memory and concentration problems, headache, anosmia, ageusia, vertigo, and insomnia. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a heterogeneous disease that lacks a universally accepted definition, which may explain the great variability in the estimated prevalence (2.3%-85%) and symptom duration. The criteria differentiating post-COVID-19 syndrome from chronic fatigue syndrome or critical illness syndrome are ambiguous. Risk factors include older age, female sex, certain comorbidities, and greater number of symptoms in the acute phase. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is largely unknown, although it is probably multifactorial, including immunological mechanisms, neural network dysfunction, neurotransmitter alterations, persistent viral damage, and functional impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID-19 syndrome may present after mild or even asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing limitations in activities of daily living and in quality of life. Further research will clarify the origin and most appropriate management of these neurological alterations."

Increased public attention on IAQ during the COVID-19 pandemic and bushfires have boosted the development and application of data-driven models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) that can be used to predict levels of pollutants and indoor exposures.
METHODS: This review summarises the types and sources of indoor air pollutants (IAP) and the indicators of IAQ. This is followed by a systematic evaluation of ANNs as predictive models of IAQ in schools, including predictive neural network algorithms and modelling processes. The methods for article selection and inclusion followed a systematic, four-step process: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion.
RESULTS: After screening and selection, nine predictive papers were included in this review. Traditional ANNs were used most frequently, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) models analysed time-series issues such as IAQ better. Meanwhile, current prediction research mainly focused on using indoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as output variables in schools and did not cover common air pollutants. Although studies have highlighted the impact of school building parameters and occupancy parameters on IAQ, it is difficult to incorporate them in predictive models.
CONCLUSIONS: This review presents the current state of IAQ predictive models and identifies the limitations and future research directions for schools."

Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity of a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding ""TBI cognitive-behavioral features"". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks."

This research examines the efficacy of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict transfusions for all inpatient operations.
METHODS: Over 1.6 million surgical cases over a two year period from the NSQIP-PUF database are used. Data from 2014 (750937 records) are used for model development and data from 2015 (885502 records) are used for model validation. ANN and regression models are developed to predict perioperative transfusions for surgical patients.
RESULTS: Various ANN models and logistic regression, using four variable sets, are compared. The best performing ANN models with respect to both sensitivity and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve outperformed all of the regression models (p < .001) and achieved a performance of 70-80% specificity with a corresponding 75-62% sensitivity.
CONCLUSION: ANNs can predict >75% of the patients who will require transfusion and 70% of those who will not. Increasing specificity to 80% still enables a sensitivity of almost 67%. The unique contribution of this research is the utilization of a single ANN model to predict transfusions across a broad range of surgical procedures."

Although extensive research has been conducted to modify unhealthy dietary behaviors across the lifespan, obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities are increasingly observed worldwide. Individually tailored interventions are nowadays considered a promising frontier for nutritional research. In this narrative review, the technologies of importance in a pediatric clinical setting are discussed. The first determinant of the dietary balance is represented by energy intakes matching individual needs. Most emerging studies highlight the opportunity to reconsider the widely used prediction equations of resting energy expenditure. Artificial Neural Network approaches may help to disentangle the role of single contributors to energy expenditure. Artificial intelligence is also useful in the prediction of the glycemic response, based on the individual microbiome. Other factors further concurring to define individually tailored nutritional needs are metabolomics and nutrigenomic. Since most available data come from studies in adult groups, new efforts should now be addressed to integrate all these aspects to develop comprehensive and-above all-effective interventions for children. IMPACT: Personalized dietary advice, specific to individuals, should be more effective in the prevention of chronic diseases than general recommendations about diet. Artificial Neural Networks algorithms are technologies of importance in a pediatric setting that may help practitioners to provide personalized nutrition. Other approaches to personalized nutrition, while promising in adults and for basic research, are still far from practical application in pediatrics."

A key application is the identification of subtle epileptogenic focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) from structural MRI. FCDs are difficult to visualize on structural MRI but are often amenable to surgical resection. We aimed to develop an open-source, interpretable, surface-based machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify FCDs on heterogeneous structural MRI data from epilepsy surgery centres worldwide. The Multi-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection (MELD) Project collated and harmonized a retrospective MRI cohort of 1015 participants, 618 patients with focal FCD-related epilepsy and 397 controls, from 22 epilepsy centres worldwide. We created a neural network for FCD detection based on 33 surface-based features. The network was trained and cross-validated on 50% of the total cohort and tested on the remaining 50% as well as on 2 independent test sites. Multidimensional feature analysis and integrated gradient saliencies were used to interrogate network performance. Our pipeline outputs individual patient reports, which identify the location of predicted lesions, alongside their imaging features and relative saliency to the classifier. On a restricted 'gold-standard' subcohort of seizure-free patients with FCD type IIB who had T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI data, the MELD FCD surface-based algorithm had a sensitivity of 85%. Across the entire withheld test cohort the sensitivity was 59% and specificity was 54%. After including a border zone around lesions, to account for uncertainty around the borders of manually delineated lesion masks, the sensitivity was 67%. This multicentre, multinational study with open access protocols and code has developed a robust and interpretable machine-learning algorithm for automated detection of focal cortical dysplasias, giving physicians greater confidence in the identification of subtle MRI lesions in individuals with epilepsy."

Understanding the wide range of risk factors for T2DM can facilitate diagnosis, proper classification and cost-effective management of the disease.
AIMS: To compare the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression in identifying T2DM risk factors.
METHODS: This descriptive and analytical study was conducted in 2013. The study samples were all residents aged 15-64 years of rural and urban areas in East Azerbaijan, Islamic Republic of Iran, who consented to participate (n = 990). The latest data available were collected from the Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance System of East Azerbaijan Province (2007). Data were analysed using SPSS version 19.
RESULTS: Based on multiple logistic regression, age, family history of T2DM and residence were the most important risk factors for T2DM. Based on ANN, age, body mass index and current smoking were most important. To test for generalization, ANN and logistic regression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC was 0.726 (SE = 0.025) and 0.717 (SE = 0.026) for logistic regression and ANN, respectively (P < 0.001).

This study aims at implementing an automated surgical risk calculator based on Artificial Neural Network technology to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications. We developed the new SUMPOT based on risk factors previously used in other scoring systems and tested it in a cohort of 560 surgical patients undergoing elective or emergency procedures and subsequently admitted to intensive care units, high-dependency units or standard wards. The whole dataset was divided into a training set, to train the predictive model, and a testing set, to assess generalization performance. The effectiveness of the Artificial Neural Network is a measure of the accuracy in detecting those patients who will develop postoperative complications. A total of 560 surgical patients entered the analysis. Among them, 77 patients (13.7%) suffered from one or more postoperative complications (PoCs), while 483 patients (86.3%) did not. The trained Artificial Neural Network returned an average classification accuracy of 90% in the testing set. Specifically, classification accuracy was 90.2% in the control group (46 patients out of 51 were correctly classified) and 88.9% in the PoC group (8 patients out of 9 were correctly classified). The Artificial Neural Network showed good performance in predicting presence/absence of postoperative complications, suggesting its potential value for perioperative management of surgical patients. Further clinical studies are required to confirm its applicability in routine clinical practice."

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve risk prediction. Here we compare the performance of an AI algorithm, the lung cancer prediction convolutional neural network (LCP-CNN), with that of the Brock University model, recommended in UK guidelines.
METHODS: A dataset of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules measuring 5-15 mm was collected retrospectively from three UK hospitals for use in a validation study. Ground truth diagnosis for each nodule was based on histology (required for any cancer), resolution, stability or (for pulmonary lymph nodes only) expert opinion. There were 1397 nodules in 1187 patients, of which 234 nodules in 229 (19.3%) patients were cancer. Model discrimination and performance statistics at predefined score thresholds were compared between the Brock model and the LCP-CNN.
RESULTS: The area under the curve for LCP-CNN was 89.6% (95% CI 87.6 to 91.5), compared with 86.8% (95% CI 84.3 to 89.1) for the Brock model (p≤0.005). Using the LCP-CNN, we found that 24.5% of nodules scored below the lowest cancer nodule score, compared with 10.9% using the Brock score. Using the predefined thresholds, we found that the LCP-CNN gave one false negative (0.4% of cancers), whereas the Brock model gave six (2.5%), while specificity statistics were similar between the two models.
CONCLUSION: The LCP-CNN score has better discrimination and allows a larger proportion of benign nodules to be identified without missing cancers than the Brock model. This has the potential to substantially reduce the proportion of surveillance CT scans required and thus save significant resources."

This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict PHER in HCC patients without macroscopic vascular invasion.
METHODS: Nine hundred and three patients who underwent curative liver resection for HCC participated in this study. They were randomly divided into derivation (n = 679) and validation (n = 224) cohorts. The ANN model was developed in the derivation cohort and subsequently verified in the validation cohort.
RESULTS: PHER morbidity in the derivation and validation cohorts was 34.8 and 39.2%, respectively. A multivariable analysis revealed that hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid load, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase level, α-fetoprotein level, tumor size, tumor differentiation, microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, and blood loss were significantly associated with PHER. These factors were incorporated into an ANN model, which displayed greater discriminatory abilities than a Cox's proportional hazards model, preexisting recurrence models, and commonly used staging systems for predicting PHER. The recurrence-free survival curves were significantly different between patients that had been stratified into two risk groups.
CONCLUSION: When compared to other models and staging systems, the ANN model has a significant advantage in predicting PHER for HCC patients without macroscopic vascular invasion."

An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that improves predictive ability through pattern recognition while continually adapting to new input data. The goal of this study was to effectively use ANN modeling to provide vascular surgeons a discriminant adjunct to assess the likelihood of in-hospital mortality on a pending rAAA admission using easily obtainable patient information from the field.
METHODS: Of 332 total patients from a single institution from 1998 to 2013 who had attempted rAAA repair, 125 were reviewed for preoperative factors associated with in-hospital mortality; 108 patients received an open operation, and 17 patients received endovascular repair. Five variables were found significant on multivariate analysis (P < .05), and four of these five (preoperative shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and age) were modeled by multiple logistic regression and an ANN. These predictive models were compared against the Glasgow Aneurysm Score. All models were assessed by generation of receiver operating characteristic curves and actual vs predicted outcomes plots, with area under the curve and Pearson r(2) value as the primary measures of discriminant ability.
RESULTS: Of the 125 patients, 53 (42%) did not survive to discharge. Five preoperative factors were significant (P < .05) independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in multivariate analysis: advanced age, renal disease, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and shock, although renal disease was excluded from the models. The sequential accumulation of zero to four of these risk factors progressively increased overall mortality rate, from 11% to 16% to 44% to 76% to 89% (age ≥ 70 years considered a risk factor). Algorithms derived from multiple logistic regression, ANN, and Glasgow Aneurysm Score models generated area under the curve values of 0.85 ± 0.04, 0.88 ± 0.04 (training set), and 0.77 ± 0.06 and Pearson r(2) values of .36, .52 and .17, respectively. The ANN model represented the most discriminant of the three.
CONCLUSIONS: An ANN-based predictive model may represent a simple, useful, and highly discriminant adjunct to the vascular surgeon in accurately identifying those patients who may carry a high mortality risk from attempted repair of rAAA, using only easily definable preoperative variables. Although still requiring external validation, our model is available for demonstration at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=NN97NM7DTK."

Among the 2,461 data collected, 741 were hypertensive (30.1%) and 1720 were normal (69.9%). During the data gathering process, eleven anthropometric measurements and sociodemographic data were collected. The variable selection procedure in the methodology proposed selected five parameters: weight, weight-to-height ratio (WHtR), age, sex, and ethnicity, as the input of the network model. The developed MLP model with a single hidden layer of 50 hidden neurons managed to achieve a sensitivity of 0.41, specificity of 0.91, precision of 0.65, F-score of 0.50, accuracy of 0.76, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) of 0.75 using the imbalanced data set. Analyzing the performance metrics obtained from the training, validation and testing data sets show that the developed network model is well-generalized. Using Bayes' Theorem, an adolescent classified as hypertensive using this created model has a 66.2% likelihood of having hypertension in the Sarawak adolescent population, which has a hypertension prevalence of 30.1%. When the prevalence of hypertension in the Sarawak population was increased to 50%, the developed model could predict an adolescent having hypertension with an 82.0% chance, whereas when the prevalence of hypertension was reduced to 10%, the developed model could only predict true positive hypertension with a 33.6% chance. With the sensitivity of the model increasing to 65% and 90% while retaining a specificity of 91%, the true positivity of an adolescent being hypertension would be 75.7% and 81.2%, respectively, according to Bayes' Theorem. The findings show that simple anthropometric measurements paired with sociodemographic data are feasible to be used to classify hypertension in adolescents using the developed MLP model in Sarawak adolescent population with modest hypertension prevalence. However, a model with higher sensitivity and specificity is required for better positive hypertension predictive value when the prevalence is low. We conclude that the developed classification model could serve as a quick and easy preliminary warning tool for screening high-risk adolescents of developing hypertension."

The heterogeneity underlying stroke poses significant challenges in the prediction of post-stroke recovery, prompting the development of neuroimaging-based biomarkers. Structural neuroimaging measurements, particularly those reflecting corticospinal tract injury, are well-documented in the literature as potential biomarker candidates of post-stroke motor recovery. Consistent with the view of stroke as a 'circuitopathy', functional neuroimaging measures probing functional connectivity may also prove informative in post-stroke recovery. An important step in the development of biomarkers based on functional neural network connectivity is the establishment of causality between connectivity and post-stroke recovery. Current evidence predominantly involves statistical correlations between connectivity measures and post-stroke behavioural status, either cross-sectionally or serially over time. However, the advancement of functional connectivity application in stroke depends on devising experiments that infer causality. In 1965, Sir Austin Bradford Hill introduced nine viewpoints to consider when determining the causality of an association: (i) strength; (ii) consistency; (iii) specificity; (iv) temporality; (v) biological gradient; (vi) plausibility; (vii) coherence; (viii) experiment; and (ix) analogy. Collectively referred to as the Bradford Hill Criteria, these points have been widely adopted in epidemiology. In this review, we assert the value of implementing Bradford Hill's framework to stroke rehabilitation and neuroimaging. We focus on the role of neural network connectivity measurements acquired from task-oriented and resting-state functional MRI, EEG, magnetoencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy in describing and predicting post-stroke behavioural status and recovery. We also identify research opportunities within each Bradford Hill tenet to shift the experimental paradigm from correlation to causation."

While the fundamental causes of this resurgence remain the subject of much conjecture, the study of historical patterns of pathogen diffusion can be illuminating. Here, we examined time series of pertussis incidence in the boroughs of Greater London from 1982 to 2013 to document the spatial epidemiology of this bacterial infection and to identify the potential drivers of its percolation. The incidence of pertussis over this period is characterized by 3 distinct stages: a period exhibiting declining trends with 4-year inter-epidemic cycles from 1982 to 1994, followed by a deep trough until 2006 and the subsequent resurgence. We observed systematic temporal trends in the age distribution of cases and the fade-out profile of pertussis coincident with increasing national vaccine coverage from 1982 to 1990. To quantify the hierarchy of epidemic phases across the boroughs of London, we used the Hilbert transform. We report a consistent pattern of spatial organization from 1982 to the early 1990s, with some boroughs consistently leading epidemic waves and others routinely lagging. To determine the potential drivers of these geographic patterns, a comprehensive parallel database of borough-specific features was compiled, comprising of demographic, movement and socio-economic factors that were used in statistical analyses to predict epidemic phase relationships among boroughs. Specifically, we used a combination of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each covariate to model predictions. Our analyses identified a number of predictors of a borough's historical epidemic phase, specifically the age composition of households, the number of agricultural and skilled manual workers, latitude, the population of public transport commuters and high-occupancy households. Univariate regression analysis of the 2012 epidemic identified the ratio of cumulative unvaccinated children to the total population and population of Pakistan-born population to have moderate positive and negative association, respectively, with the timing of epidemic. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of contemporary pertussis transmission in a large metropolitan population, this study has identified the characteristics that determine the spatial spread of this bacterium across the boroughs of London."

Current United States pediatric reference ranges from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) include 20% of children with obesity, body mass index of ≥95th percentile.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) based reference ranges in a diverse cohort with low-obesity prevalence from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS).
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal, prospective, observational cohort. Healthy children (height and BMI within 3rd to 97th percentiles, ages 5-19 y at enrollment), from 5 United States centers were measured annually for ≤7 visits. Whole body scans were acquired using Hologic scanners. A subsample underwent repeat measurements to determine precision. We generated reference ranges for appendicular and total lean soft tissue mass index (LSTM Index), fat mass index (FMI), and other body composition measures. Resulting curves were compared to NHANES and across subgroups. Sex and age-specific equations were developed to adjust body composition Z-scores for height Z score.
RESULTS: We obtained 9846 scans of 2011 participants (51% female, 22% Black, 17% Hispanic, 48% White, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 6% with obesity). Precision (percent coefficient of variation) ranged from 0.7% to 1.96%. Median and-2 standard deviation curves for BMDCS and NHANES were similar, but NHANES +2 standard deviation LSTM Index and FMI curves were distinctly greater than the respective BMDCS curves. Subgroup differences were more extreme for appendicular LSTM Index-Z (mean ± SD: Asian -0.52 ± 0.93 compared with Black 0.77 ± 0.87) than for FMI-Z (Hispanic 0.29 ± 0.98 compared with Black -0.14 ± 1.1) and were smaller for Z-scores adjusted for height Z-score.
CONCLUSIONS: These reference ranges add to sparse normative data regarding body composition in children and adolescents and are based on a cohort with an obesity prevalence similar to current BMI charts. Awareness of subgroup differences aids in interpreting results."

METHODS: Six hundred and eight-four cases of consecutive HBV-ACLF patients were retrospectively reviewed. Four hundred and twenty-three cases were used for training and constructing ANN models, and the remaining 261 cases were for validating the established models. Predictors associated with mortality were determined by univariate analysis and were then included in ANN models for predicting prognosis of mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the ANN models in comparison with various current prognostic models.
RESULTS: Variables with statistically significant difference or important clinical characteristics were input in the ANN training process, and eight independent risk factors, including age, hepatic encephalopathy, serum sodium, prothrombin activity, γ-glutamyltransferase, hepatitis B e antigen, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, were eventually used to establish ANN models. For 28-day mortality in the training cohort, the model's predictive accuracy (AUR 0.948, 95% CI 0.925-0.970) was significantly higher than that of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), Chronic Liver Failure-ACLF (CLIF-ACLF), and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) (all p < 0.001). In the validation cohorts the predictive accuracy of ANN model (AUR 0.748, 95% CI: 0.673-0.822) was significantly higher than that of MELD (p = 0.0099) and insignificantly higher than that of MELD-Na, CTP and CLIF-ACLF (p > 0.05). For 90-day mortality in the training cohort, the model's predictive accuracy (AUR 0.913, 95% CI 0.887-0.938) was significantly higher than that of MELD, MELD-Na, CTP and CLIF-ACLF (all p < 0.001).

Since the treatments for advanced radiographic knee OA are limited, clinicians face a significant challenge of identifying patients who are at high risk of OA in a timely and appropriate way. Therefore, we developed a simple self-assessment scoring system and an improved artificial neural network (ANN) model for knee OA.
METHODS: The Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES V-1) data were used to develop a scoring system and ANN for radiographic knee OA. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of the scoring system. The ANN was constructed using 1777 participants and validated internally on 888 participants in the KNHANES V-1. The predictors of the scoring system were selected as the inputs of the ANN. External validation was performed using 4731 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic was calculated to compare the prediction models.
RESULTS: The scoring system and ANN were built using the independent predictors including sex, age, body mass index, educational status, hypertension, moderate physical activity, and knee pain. In the internal validation, both scoring system and ANN predicted radiographic knee OA (AUC 0.73 versus 0.81, p<0.001) and symptomatic knee OA (AUC 0.88 versus 0.94, p<0.001) with good discriminative ability. In the external validation, both scoring system and ANN showed lower discriminative ability in predicting radiographic knee OA (AUC 0.62 versus 0.67, p<0.001) and symptomatic knee OA (AUC 0.70 versus 0.76, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The self-assessment scoring system may be useful for identifying the adults at high risk for knee OA. The performance of the scoring system is improved significantly by the ANN. We provided an ANN calculator to simply predict the knee OA risk."

Here, we develop a generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for acute bacterial and viral infections. We use training data (N = 1069) from 18 retrospective transcriptomic studies. Using only 29 preselected host mRNAs, we train a neural-network classifier with a bacterial-vs-other area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) and a viral-vs-other AUROC 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.93). We then apply this classifier, inflammatix-bacterial-viral-noninfected-version 1 (IMX-BVN-1), without retraining, to an independent cohort (N = 163). In this cohort, IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.93), and viral-vs.-other 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.93). In patients enrolled within 36 h of hospital admission (N = 70), IMX-BVN-1 AUROCs are: bacterial-vs.-other 0.92 (95% CI 0.83-0.99), and viral-vs.-other 0.91 (95% CI 0.82-0.98). With further study, IMX-BVN-1 could provide a tool for assessing patients with suspected infection and sepsis at hospital admission."

Epub 2020 Jul 15.,Li Z,Cancer Med,2020,2020/07/16,PMC7476835,,10.1002/cam4.3245,"BACKGROUND: Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) methods have also been adopted to deal with the complex multidimensional nonlinear relationship between clinicopathologic variables and survival for patients with gastric cancer. Using a multinational cohort, this study aimed to develop and validate an ANN-based survival prediction model for patients with gastric cancer.
METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy in a Chinese center, a Japanese center, and recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, respectively, were included in this study. Multilayer perceptron neural network was used to develop the prediction model. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curves (AUCs), and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to compare the ANN model with previous prediction models.
RESULTS: An ANN model with nine input nodes, nine hidden nodes, and two output nodes was constructed. These three cohort's data showed that the AUC of the model was 0.795, 0.836, and 0.850 for 5-year survival prediction, respectively. In the calibration curve analysis, the ANN-predicted survival had a high consistency with the actual survival. Comparison of the DCA and time-dependent ROC between the ANN model and previous prediction models showed that the ANN model had good and stable prediction capability compared to the previous models in all cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model has significantly better discriminative capability and allows an individualized survival prediction. This model has good versatility in Eastern and Western data and has high clinical application value."

It remains a controversy whether the network-based methods have advantageous performance than regression-based methods, and to what extent do they outperform.
METHODS: Simulations under different scenarios (the input variables are independent or in network relationship) as well as an application were conducted to assess the prediction performance of four typical methods including Bayesian network, neural network, logistic regression and regression splines.
RESULTS: The simulation results reveal that Bayesian network showed a better performance when the variables were in a network relationship or in a chain structure. For the special wheel network structure, logistic regression had a considerable performance compared to others. Further application on GWAS of leprosy show Bayesian network still outperforms other methods.
CONCLUSION: Although regression-based methods are still popular and widely used, network-based approaches should be paid more attention, since they capture the complex relationship between variables."

However, little is known about the association of dopamine dysregulation with brain functional connectivity in psychotic disorders, specifically through the administration of antipsychotic medication. In this systematic review, we summarize the existing evidence on the association of dopaminergic effects with electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) resting-state brain functional connectivity assessed by sensor- as well as source-level measures. A wide heterogeneity of results was found amongst the 20 included studies with increased and decreased functional connectivity in medicated psychosis patients vs. healthy controls in widespread brain areas across all frequency bands. No systematic difference in results was seen between studies with medicated and those with unmedicated psychosis patients and very few studies directly investigated the effect of dopamine agents with a pre-post design. The reported evidence clearly calls for longitudinal EEG and MEG studies with large participant samples to directly explore the association of antipsychotic medication effects with neural network changes over time during illness progression and to ultimately support the development of new treatment strategies."

Our systematic review is aimed at demonstrating diagnosis accuracy between the BP-ANN algorithm and linear regression in digestive disease patients, including their activation function and data structure.
METHODS: We reported the systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines. We searched related articles from seven electronic scholarly databases for comparison of the diagnosis accuracy focusing on BP-ANN and linear regression. The characteristics, patient number, input/output marker, diagnosis accuracy, and results/conclusions related to comparison were extracted independently based on inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Nine articles met all the criteria and were enrolled in our review. Of those enrolled articles, the publishing year ranged from 1991 to 2017. The sample size ranged from 42 to 3222 digestive disease patients, and all of the patients showed comparable biomarkers between the BP-ANN algorithm and linear regression. According to our study, 8 literature demonstrated that the BP-ANN model is superior to linear regression in predicting the disease outcome based on AUROC results. One literature reported linear regression to be superior to BP-ANN for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSION: The BP-ANN algorithm and linear regression both had high capacity in fitting the diagnostic model and BP-ANN displayed more prediction accuracy for the noninvasive diagnosis model of digestive diseases. We compared the activation functions and data structure between BP-ANN and linear regression for fitting the diagnosis model, and the data suggested that BP-ANN was a comprehensive recommendation algorithm."

The epidemic quickly broke out and spread throughout the country. Now it becomes a pandemic that affects the whole world. In this study, three models were used to fit and predict the epidemic situation in China: a modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead) dynamic model, a neural network method LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and a GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression) model reflecting spatial heterogeneity. Overall, all the three models performed well with great accuracy. The dynamic SEIRD prediction APE (absolute percent error) of China had been ≤ 1.0% since Mid-February. The LSTM model showed comparable accuracy. The GWR model took into account the influence of geographical differences, with R2 = 99.98% in fitting and 97.95% in prediction. Wilcoxon test showed that none of the three models outperformed the other two at the significance level of 0.05. The parametric analysis of the infectious rate and recovery rate demonstrated that China's national policies had effectively slowed down the spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the models in this study provided a wide range of implications for other countries to predict the short-term and long-term trend of COVID-19, and to evaluate the intensity and effect of their interventions."

Although various methods have been used in OSA prediction, this study aimed to develop predictions using simple and general predictors incorporating machine learning algorithms. This single-center, retrospective observational study assessed the diagnostic relevance of age, sex, and BMI for OSA in a cohort of 9, 422 patients who had undergone polysomnography (PSG) between 2015 and 2020. The participants were randomly divided into training, testing, and independent validation groups. Multivariable logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms used age, sex, and BMI as predictors to develop risk-predicting models for moderate-and-severe OSA. The training-testing dataset was used to assess the model generalizability through five-fold cross-validation. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the independent validation set to assess the performance of the model. The results showed that age, sex, and BMI were significantly associated with OSA. The validation AUCs of the generated LR and ANN models were 0.806 and 0.807, respectively. The independent validation set's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 76.3%, 87.5%, 57.0%, 77.7%, and 72.7% for the LR model, and 76.4%, 87.7%, 56.9%, 77.7%, and 73.0% respectively, for the ANN model.

To reduce unnecessary surgical resections, we used artificial intelligence to build a model to identify T1 colorectal tumors at risk for metastasis to lymph node and validated the model in a separate set of patients.
METHODS: We collected data from 3134 patients with T1 CRC treated at 6 hospitals in Japan from April 1997 through September 2017 (training cohort). We developed a machine-learning artificial neural network (ANN) using data on patients' age and sex, as well as tumor size, location, morphology, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and histologic grade. We then conducted the external validation on the ANN model using independent 939 patients at another hospital during the same period (validation cohort). We calculated areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves (AUCs) for the ability of the model and US guidelines to identify patients with lymph node metastases.
RESULTS: Lymph node metastases were found in 319 (10.2%) of 3134 patients in the training cohort and 79 (8.4%) of /939 patients in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.83, whereas the guidelines identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.73 (P < .001). When the analysis was limited to patients with initial endoscopic resection (n = 517), the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.84 and the guidelines identified these patients with an AUC of 0.77 (P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying patients with T1 CRCs who had lymph node metastases. This model might be used to determine which patients require additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 CRCs. UMIN Clinical Trials Registry no: UMIN000038609."

We aimed to establish the accuracy of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm in predicting 1-year mortality and admission to hospital for heart failure after myocardial infarction.
METHODS: In this nationwide population-based study, we used data for all patients admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction and discharged alive from a coronary care unit in Sweden (n=139 288) between Jan 1, 2008, and April 1, 2017, from the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) nationwide registry; these patients were randomly divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We developed an ANN using 21 variables (including age, sex, medical history, previous medications, in-hospital characteristics, and discharge medications) associated with the outcomes of interest with a back-propagation algorithm in the training dataset and tested it in the testing dataset. The ANN algorithm was then validated in patients with incident myocardial infarction enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry (external validation cohort) between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Youden's index was established as a means of identifying an empirical dichotomous cutoff, allowing further evaluation of model performance.
FINDINGS: 139 288 patients who were admitted to hospital for myocardial infarction in the SWEDEHEART registry were randomly divided into a training dataset of 111 558 (80%) patients and a testing dataset of 27 730 (20%) patients. 30 971 patients with myocardial infarction who were enrolled in the Western Denmark Heart Registry were included in the external validation cohort. A first event, either all-cause mortality or admission to hospital for heart failure 1 year after myocardial infarction, occurred in 32 308 (23·2%) patients in the testing and training cohorts only. For 1-year all-cause mortality, the ANN had an AUROC of 0·85 (95% CI 0·84-0·85) in the testing dataset and 0·84 (0·83-0·84) in the external validation cohort. The AUROC for admission to hospital for heart failure within 1 year was 0·82 (0·81-0·82) in the testing dataset and 0·78 (0·77-0·79) in the external validation dataset. With an empirical cutoff the ANN algorithm correctly classified 73·6% of patients with regard to all-cause mortality and 61·5% of patients with regard to admission to hospital for heart failure in the external validation cohort, ruling out adverse outcomes with 97·1-98·7% probability in the external validation cohort.
INTERPRETATION: Identifying patients at a high risk of developing heart failure or death after myocardial infarction could result in tailored therapies and monitoring by the allocation of resources to those at greatest risk.

This overall incidence growth is especially driven by increased diagnosis of indolent and well-differentiated papillary subtype and early-stage thyroid cancer, whereas the incidence of advanced-stage thyroid cancer has increased marginally. Thyroid ultrasound is frequently used to diagnose thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to use deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models to improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer by analysing sonographic imaging data from clinical ultrasounds.
METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study using ultrasound images sets from three hospitals in China. We developed and trained the DCNN model on the training set, 131 731 ultrasound images from 17 627 patients with thyroid cancer and 180 668 images from 25 325 controls from the thyroid imaging database at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Clinical diagnosis of the training set was made by 16 radiologists from Tianjin Cancer Hospital. Images from anatomical sites that were judged as not having cancer were excluded from the training set and only individuals with suspected thyroid cancer underwent pathological examination to confirm diagnosis. The model's diagnostic performance was validated in an internal validation set from Tianjin Cancer Hospital (8606 images from 1118 patients) and two external datasets in China (the Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, Jilin, 741 images from 154 patients; and the Weihai Municipal Hospital, Shandong, 11 039 images from 1420 patients). All individuals with suspected thyroid cancer after clinical examination in the validation sets had pathological examination. We also compared the specificity and sensitivity of the DCNN model with the performance of six skilled thyroid ultrasound radiologists on the three validation sets.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2012, and March 28, 2018, ultrasound images for the four study cohorts were obtained. The model achieved high performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients in the validation sets tested, with area under the curve values of 0·947 (95% CI 0·935-0·959) for the Tianjin internal validation set, 0·912 (95% CI 0·865-0·958) for the Jilin external validation set, and 0·908 (95% CI 0·891-0·925) for the Weihai external validation set. The DCNN model also showed improved performance in identifying thyroid cancer patients versus skilled radiologists. For the Tianjin internal validation set, sensitivity was 93·4% (95% CI 89·6-96·1) versus 96·9% (93·9-98·6; p=0·003) and specificity was 86·1% (81·1-90·2) versus 59·4% (53·0-65·6; p<0·0001). For the Jilin external validation set, sensitivity was 84·3% (95% CI 73·6-91·9) versus 92·9% (84·1-97·6; p=0·048) and specificity was 86·9% (95% CI 77·8-93·3) versus 57·1% (45·9-67·9; p<0·0001). For the Weihai external validation set, sensitivity was 84·7% (95% CI 77·0-90·7) versus 89·0% (81·9-94·0; p=0·25) and specificity was 87·8% (95% CI 81·6-92·5) versus 68·6% (60·7-75·8; p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: The DCNN model showed similar sensitivity and improved specificity in identifying patients with thyroid cancer compared with a group of skilled radiologists. The improved technical performance of the DCNN model warrants further investigation as part of randomised clinical trials.

Thus, the performance of the current machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models and their benefits and weakness need to be evaluated for the future development of feasible and efficient risk prediction models.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the performance and the clinical feasibility of the currently available machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models.
METHODS: We searched for papers published until June 9, 2021, on machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies describing the development or validation models for predicting future breast cancer risk were included. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was used to assess the risk of bias and the clinical applicability of the included studies. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 10 data sets were included. Neural network was the most common machine learning method for the development of breast cancer risk prediction models. The pooled AUC of the machine learning-based optimal risk prediction model reported in each study was 0.73 (95% CI 0.66-0.80; approximate 95% prediction interval 0.56-0.96), with a high level of heterogeneity between studies (Q=576.07, I2=98.44%; P&lt;.001). The results of head-to-head comparison of the performance difference between the 2 types of models trained by the same data set showed that machine learning models had a slightly higher advantage than traditional risk factor-based models in predicting future breast cancer risk. The pooled AUC of the neural network-based risk prediction model was higher than that of the nonneural network-based optimal risk prediction model (0.71 vs 0.68, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that the incorporation of imaging features in risk models resulted in a higher pooled AUC than the nonincorporation of imaging features in risk models (0.73 vs 0.61; P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=.001, respectively). The PROBAST analysis indicated that many machine learning models had high risk of bias and poorly reported calibration analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows that the current machine learning-based breast cancer risk prediction models have some technical pitfalls and that their clinical feasibility and reliability are unsatisfactory."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicentric retrospective study included patients with HCC who underwent transarterial chemoembolization monotherapy as an initial treatment at 4 institutions between January 2008 and December 2016. In the training cohort, significant risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. The prognostic nomograms and ANN were established and then validated in 2 validation cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 838 patients (548, 115, and 175 in the training cohort and validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively) were included. The median OS was 10.4, 15.7, and 9.2 months in the training cohort and validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. In the training cohort, both ALBI grade and CTP score were identified as significant risk factors. The ALBI grade and CTP score based on nomograms were established separately and showed similar prognostic performance when assessed externally in validation cohorts (C-index in validation cohort 1: 0.823 vs 0.802, P = .417; in validation cohort 2: 0.716 vs 0.729, P = .793). ANN showed that ALBI grade had higher importance on survival prediction than CTP score.
CONCLUSIONS: ALBI grade performs at least no worse than CTP score regarding survival prediction for HCC receiving transarterial chemoembolization. Considering the easy application, ALBI grade has the potential to be regarded as an alternative to CTP score."

Interested participants after initial screening and meeting the eligibility criteria, will be asked to fill the questionnaire (having demographic and work related with Mini Z questionnaire) to assess burnout. The healthcare workers will include physicians at all levels of training, nursing staff and paramedical staff who are involved directly or indirectly in COVID-19 care. The analysis of the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data and development of algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be done by experts.
CONCLUSIONS: In Summary, we propose that ECG data generated from the people with burnout can be utilized to develop AI-enabled model to predict the presence of stress and burnout in HCWs in COVID-19 era."

In this study we assessed whether these results replicate on a gene level in our European cohort and whether effects are altered by lifetime depression. We tested SNPs of the loci and their vicinity with or without interaction with depression in regression models. Advanced analysis methods such as Bayesian relevance analysis and a neural network based classifier were used to confirm findings. Main effects were found for rs2455107 of PRDM16 (OR = 1.304, p = 0.007) and five intergenic polymorphisms in 1p31.1 region: two of them showed risk effect (OR = 1.277, p = 0.003 for both rs11209657 and rs6686879), while the other three variants were protective factors (OR = 0.4956, p = 0.006 for both rs12090642 and rs72948266; OR = 0.4756, p = 0.005 for rs77864828). Additionally, 26 polymorphisms within ADGRL2, 2 in REST, 1 in HPSE2 and 33 mostly intergenic SNPs from 1p31.1 showed interaction effects. Among clumped results representing these significant regions, only rs11163394 of ADGRL2 showed a protective effect (OR = 0.607, p = 0.002), all other variants were risk factors (rs1043215 of REST with the strongest effect: OR = 6.596, p = 0.003). Bayesian relevance analysis confirmed the relevance of intergenic rs6660757 and rs12128399 (p31.1), rs1043215 (REST), rs1889974 (HPSE2) and rs11163394 (ADGRL2) from depression interaction results, and the moderate relevance of rs77864828 and rs2455107 of PRDM16 from main effect analysis. Both main and interaction effect SNPs could enhance predictive power with the neural network based classifier. In summary, we replicated p31.1, PRDM16, REST, HPSE2 and ADGRL2 genes with classic genetic and advanced analysis methods. While the p31.1 region and PRDM16 are worthy of further investigations in migraine in general, REST, HPSE2 and ADGRL2 may be prime candidates behind migraine pathophysiology in patients with comorbid depression."

Combining small RNA sequencing from 179 human serum samples with a neural network analysis produced a miRNA algorithm for diagnosis of EOC (AUC 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-0.99). The model significantly outperformed CA125 and functioned well regardless of patient age, histology, or stage. Among 454 patients with various diagnoses, the miRNA neural network had 100% specificity for ovarian cancer. After using 325 samples to adapt the neural network to qPCR measurements, the model was validated using 51 independent clinical samples, with a positive predictive value of 91.3% (95% CI: 73.3-97.6%) and negative predictive value of 78.6% (95% CI: 64.2-88.2%). Finally, biologic relevance was tested using in situ hybridization on 30 pre-metastatic lesions, showing intratumoral concentration of relevant miRNAs. These data suggest circulating miRNAs have potential to develop a non-invasive diagnostic test for ovarian cancer."

Epub 2019 Oct 5.,Ma R,Sci Total Environ,2020,2019/11/10,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134463,"BACKGROUND: Studies have discovered the adverse health impacts of ambient ozone. Most epidemiological studies explore the relationship between ambient ozone and health effects based on fixed site monitoring data. Fine modeling of ground-level ozone exposure conducted by statistical models has great advantages for improving exposure accuracy and reducing exposure bias. However, there is no review summarizing such studies.
OBJECTIVES: A review is presented to summarize the basic process of model development and to provide some suggestions for researchers.
METHODS: A search of PubMed, Web of Science and the Wanfang Database was performed for dates through July 1, 2019 to obtain relevant studies worldwide. We also examined the references of the articles of interest to ensure that as many articles as possible were included.
RESULTS: The land use regression model (LUR model), random forest model and artificial neural network model have been used in this field. We summarized these studies in terms of model selection, data preparation, simulation scale selection, and model establishment and validation. Multiparameters are a major feature of models. Parameters that influence the formation of ground-level ozone concentrations and parameters that have been extremely important in previous articles should be considered first. The process of model establishment and validation is essentially a process of continuously optimizing the model performance, but there are certain differences in the specific models.
CONCLUSION: This review summarized the basic process of the statistical model for ambient ozone exposure. We gave the applicable conditions and application scope of different models and summarized the advantages and disadvantages of various models in ozone modeling research. In the future, research is still needed to explore this area based on its own research purposes and capabilities."

However, a few studies applied the model to predict in-hospital mortality using routine blood samples at the time of hospital admission. This study aimed to develop an app, name predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients (PMCP) app, to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients at hospital-admission time.
METHODS:: We downloaded patient records from 2 studies, including 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and 106 COVID-19 patients in 3 Korean medical institutions. A total of 30 feature variables were retrieved, consisting of 28 blood biomarkers and 2 demographic variables (i.e., age and gender) of patients. Two models, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), were compared with each other across 2 scenarios using: 1. raw laboratory versus normalized data and 2. training vs testing datasets (n = 361 and n = 106/361≅30%) to verify the model performance (e.g., sensitivity [SENS], specificity [SPEC], and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). An app for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients was developed using the model's estimated parameters for the prediction and classification of PMCP at an earlier stage. Feature variables and prediction results were visualized using the forest plot and category probability curves shown on Google Maps.
RESULTS:: We observed that: 1. the normalized dataset gains a relatively higher AUC(>0.9) when compared to that(<0.9) in the raw-laboratory dataset based on training data, 2. the normalized dataset in ANN yielded a high AUC of 0.96 that that(=0.91) in CNN based on testing data, and 3. a ready and available app, where anyone can access the model to predict mortality, for PMCP was developed in this study.
CONCLUSIONS:: Our new PMCP app with ANN model accurately predicts the mortality probability for COVID-19 patients. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients’ classifications against treatment risk."

The objectives of this paper are to determine the extent of Salmonella and Escherichia coli infections in MS, and determine the Salmonella infections correlation with socioeconomic status using geographical information system (GIS) and neural network models.
METHODS: In this study, the relevant updated data of foodborne illness for southern states, from 2002 to 2011, were collected and used in the GIS and neural networks models. Data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MS state Department of Health and the other states department of health. The correlation between low socioeconomic status and Salmonella infections were determined using models created by several software packages, including SAS, ArcGIS @RISK and NeuroShell.
RESULTS: Results of this study showed a significant increase in Salmonella outbreaks in MS during the study period, with highest rates in 2011 (47.84 ± 24.41 cases/100,000; p<0.001). MS had the highest rates of Salmonella outbreaks compared with other states (36 ± 6.29 cases/100,000; p<0.001). Regional and district variations in the rates were also observed. GIS maps of Salmonella outbreaks in MS in 2010 and 2011 showed the districts with higher rates of Salmonella. Regression analysis and neural network models showed a moderate correlation between cases of Salmonella infections and low socioeconomic factors. Poverty was shown to have a negative correlation with Salmonella outbreaks (R(2)=0.152, p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Geographic location besides socioeconomic status may contribute to the high rates of Salmonella outbreaks in MS. Understanding the geographical and economic relationship with infectious diseases will help to determine effective methods to reduce outbreaks within low socioeconomic status communities."

A minority of patients require reintervention but cannot be predictively identified by existing methods. This study aimed to improve the prediction of endograft complications and mortality, through the application of machine-learning techniques.
METHODS: Patients undergoing EVAR at 2 centres were studied from 2004-2010. Pre-operative aneurysm morphology was quantified and endograft complications were recorded up to 5 years following surgery. An artificial neural networks (ANN) approach was used to predict whether patients would be at low- or high-risk of endograft complications (aortic/limb) or mortality. Centre 1 data were used for training and centre 2 data for validation. ANN performance was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the incidence of aortic complications, limb complications, and mortality; in patients predicted to be low-risk, versus those predicted to be high-risk.
RESULTS: 761 patients aged 75 +/- 7 years underwent EVAR. Mean follow-up was 36+/- 20 months. An ANN was created from morphological features including angulation/length/areas/diameters/volume/tortuosity of the aneurysm neck/sac/iliac segments. ANN models predicted endograft complications and mortality with excellent discrimination between a low-risk and high-risk group. In external validation, the 5-year rates of freedom from aortic complications, limb complications and mortality were 95.9% vs 67.9%; 99.3% vs 92.0%; and 87.9% vs 79.3% respectively (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study presents ANN models that stratify the 5-year risk of endograft complications or mortality using routinely available pre-operative data."

All subjects were interviewed face-to-face to fill in a questionnaire that covered 36 CHD-related variables. The 358 subjects were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set at the ratio of 85:15. The training set was used to identify the significant predictors of CHD by univariate logistic regression analyses and develop a standard feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model for the prediction of CHD. The testing set was used to test and evaluate the performance of the ANN model. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed on SPSS 18.0. The ANN models were developed on Matlab 7.1.The univariate logistic regression identified 15 predictors that were significantly associated with CHD, including education level (odds ratio  = 0.55), gravidity (1.95), parity (2.01), history of abnormal reproduction (2.49), family history of CHD (5.23), maternal chronic disease (4.19), maternal upper respiratory tract infection (2.08), environmental pollution around maternal dwelling place (3.63), maternal exposure to occupational hazards (3.53), maternal mental stress (2.48), paternal chronic disease (4.87), paternal exposure to occupational hazards (2.51), intake of vegetable/fruit (0.45), intake of fish/shrimp/meat/egg (0.59), and intake of milk/soymilk (0.55). After many trials, we selected a 3-layer BPNN model with 15, 12, and 1 neuron in the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively, as the best prediction model. The prediction model has accuracies of 0.91 and 0.86 on the training and testing sets, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and Yuden Index on the testing set (training set) are 0.78 (0.83), 0.90 (0.95), and 0.68 (0.78), respectively. The areas under the receiver operating curve on the testing and training sets are 0.87 and 0.97, respectively.This study suggests that the BPNN model could be used to predict the risk of CHD in individuals. This model should be further improved by large-sample-size research."

METHODS: For this retrospective observational study, data from baseline and follow-up visits on the number of comorbidities, prescribed anti-osteoporotic treatment and vertebral, humerus or hip fractures in 993 patients from the OSTEOMED registry were analyzed using logistic regression and an artificial network model.
RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that the probability of reducing fractures for each anti-osteoporotic treatment considered was independent of sex, age, and the number of comorbidities, increasing significantly only in males taking vitamin D (OR = 7.918), patients without comorbidities taking vitamin D (OR = 4.197) and patients with ≥ 3 comorbidities taking calcium (OR = 9.412). Logistic regression correctly classified 96% of patients (Hosmer-Lemeshow = 0.492) compared with the artificial neural network model, which correctly classified 95% of patients (AUC = 0.6).
CONCLUSION: In general, sex, age and the number of comorbidities did not influence the likelihood that a given anti-osteoporotic treatment improved the risk of incident fragility fractures after 1 year, but this appeared to increase when patients had been treated with risedronate, strontium or teriparatide. The two models used classified patients similarly, but predicted differently in terms of the probability of improvement, with logistic regression being the better fit."

With the advancement in computational technology, machine learning (ML) has become the widely used tool to develop a prediction model. This review is to investigate the current development of prediction model for the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients using machine learning. A systematic search on Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) was conducted to look for relevant articles based on the research question. The risk of bias (ROB) for all articles were assessed based on the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) statement. Neural network with 76.6% precision, 88.06% sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 was found to be the most reliable algorithm in developing prediction model for cardiovascular disease among type 2 diabetes patients. The overall concern of applicability of all included studies is low. While two out of 10 studies were shown to have high ROB, another studies ROB are unknown due to the lack of information. The adherence to reporting standards was conducted based on the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) standard where the overall score is 53.75%. It is highly recommended that future model development should adhere to the PROBAST and TRIPOD assessment to reduce the risk of bias and ensure its applicability in clinical settings. Potential lipid peroxidation marker is also recommended in future cardiovascular disease prediction model to improve overall model applicability."

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected neonatal and follow-up data.
SETTING: Three population-based observational cohort studies: the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN), the Canadian Neonatal and Follow-up Networks (CNN/CNFUN) and the French cohort Etude (Epidémiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels: EPIPAGE-2).
PATIENTS: Extremely preterm neonates of <28 weeks' gestation in year 2011.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was composite of mortality or sNSI defined by cerebral palsy with no independent walking, disabling hearing loss and bilateral blindness.
RESULTS: Overall, 3055 infants (ANZNN n=960, CNN/CNFUN n=1019, EPIPAGE-2 n=1076) were included in the study. Primary composite outcome rates were 21.3%, 20.6% and 28.4%; mortality rates were 18.7%, 17.4% and 26.3%; and rates of sNSI among survivors were 4.3%, 5.3% and 3.3% for ANZNN, CNN/CNFUN and EPIPAGE-2, respectively. Adjusted for gestational age and multiple births, EPIPAGE-2 had higher odds of composite outcome compared with ANZNN (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.13) and CNN/CNFUN (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.12). EPIPAGE-2 did have a trend of lower odds of sNDI but far short of compensating for the significant increase in mortality odds. These differences may be related to variations in perinatal approach and practices (and not to differences in infants' baseline characteristics).
CONCLUSIONS: Composite outcome of mortality or sNSI for extremely preterm infants differed across high-income countries with similar baseline characteristics and access to healthcare."

Our objective was to determine the association between early (within 2 days of birth) versus late caffeine exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants.
METHODS: Infants of <29 weeks' gestation born between April 2009 and September 2011 and admitted to Canadian Neonatal Network units and then assessed at Canadian Neonatal Follow-up Network centers were studied. Neonates who received caffeine were divided into early- (received within 2 days of birth) and late-caffeine (received after 2 days of birth) groups. The primary outcome was significant neurodevelopmental impairment, defined as cerebral palsy, or a Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition composite score of <70 on any component, hearing aid or cochlear implant, or bilateral visual impairment at 18 to 24 months' corrected age.
RESULTS: Of 2108 neonates who were eligible, 1545 were in the early-caffeine group and 563 were in the late-caffeine group. Rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and severe neurologic injury were lower in the early-caffeine group than in the late-caffeine group. Significant neurodevelopmental impairment (adjusted odds ratio 0.68 [95% confidence interval 0.50-0.94]) and odds of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition cognitive scores of <85 (adjusted odds ratio 0.67 [95% confidence interval 0.47-0.95]) were lower in the early-caffeine group than in the late-caffeine group. Propensity score-based matched-pair analyses revealed lower odds of cerebral palsy and hearing impairment only.
CONCLUSIONS: Early caffeine therapy is associated with better neurodevelopmental outcomes compared with late caffeine therapy in preterm infants born at <29 weeks' gestation."

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analyses examined very low-birth-weight infants admitted to the NRNJ or CNN in 2006 to 2008. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared a composite outcome indicating a mortality or major morbidity (severe intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or necrotizing enterocolitis) between networks, according to PDA diagnosis and treatment, and tested the association between PDA treatment and the composite outcome within networks.
RESULTS: PDA treatment (NRNJ:CNN) with conservative management (8%:16%), indomethacin only (77%:59%), ligation only (1%:13%), or indomethacin and ligation (14%:13%) varied significantly between networks. The composite outcome was lower in NRNJ versus CNN only among infants with PDA (odds ratio: 0.70; 95% confidence interval: 0.62-0.80). Surgical ligation was associated with higher composite outcome only in CNN (odds ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-2.28).
CONCLUSION: Lower composite mortality/morbidity outcome in Japan versus Canada only among infants with PDA, and association of surgical ligation with higher mortality/morbidity only in Canada, suggest differential PDA management and ligation processes contribute to outcome variation."

Within nephrology, remote patient monitoring has most often been applied to the care of patients on home dialysis modalities. The effect that remote and virtual technologies have on home dialysis patients, telehealth and health care disparities, and health care providers' workflow changes are discussed here. Moreover, the future use of remote and virtual technologies to include artificial intelligence and artificial neural network model to optimize and personalize treatments will be highlighted. Despite these advances in technology challenges continue to exist, leaving room for future innovation to improve patient health outcome and equity.

Insecticide resistance is already widespread in the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. Aegypti; is emerging in the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. Albopictus; and is now threatening the global fight against human arboviral diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Because the panel of insecticides available for public health is limited, it is of primary importance to preserve the efficacy of existing and upcoming active ingredients. Timely implementation of insecticide resistance management (IRM) is crucial to maintain the arsenal of effective public health insecticides and sustain arbovirus vector control.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This Review is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN) and aims at defining the principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting the evolution of resistance, and evaluating the value of existing tools for resistance monitoring. Based on the lessons taken from resistance strategies used for other vector species and agricultural pests, we propose a framework for the implementation of IRM strategies for Aedes mosquito vectors.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Although IRM should be a fixture of all vector control programs, it is currently often absent from the strategic plans to control mosquito-borne diseases, especially arboviruses. Experiences from other public health disease vectors and agricultural pests underscore the need for urgent action in implementing IRM for invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Based on a plan developed for malaria vectors, here we propose some key activities to establish a global plan for IRM in Aedes spp."

To test novel interventions, personalized risk prediction is essential. The ORBI (Observatoire Régional Breton sur l'Infarctus) score represents the first-of-its-kind risk score to predict in-hospital CS in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, its sex-specific performance remains unknown, and refined risk prediction strategies are warranted.
METHODS: This multinational study included a total of 53 537 ACS patients without CS on admission undergoing PCI. Following sex-specific evaluation of ORBI, regression and machine-learning models were used for variable selection and risk prediction. By combining best-performing models with highest-ranked predictors, SEX-SHOCK was developed, and internally and externally validated.
RESULTS: The ORBI score showed lower discriminative performance for the prediction of CS in females than males in Swiss (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% confidence interval]: 0.78 [0.76-0.81] vs. 0.81 [0.79-0.83]; P =.048) and French ACS patients (0.77 [0.74-0.81] vs. 0.84 [0.81-0.86]; P = .002). The newly developed SEX-SHOCK score, now incorporating ST-segment elevation, creatinine, C-reactive protein, and left ventricular ejection fraction, outperformed ORBI in both sexes (females: 0.81 [0.78-0.83]; males: 0.83 [0.82-0.85]; P < .001), which prevailed following internal and external validation in RICO (females: 0.82 [0.79-0.85]; males: 0.88 [0.86-0.89]; P < .001) and SPUM-ACS (females: 0.83 [0.77-0.90], P = .004; males: 0.83 [0.80-0.87], P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ORBI score showed modest sex-specific performance. The novel SEX-SHOCK score provides superior performance in females and males across the entire spectrum of ACS, thus providing a basis for future interventional trials and contemporary ACS management."

In this paper, we explored the ways in which public risk perception can be more accurately predicted in the era of big data. We obtained internal characteristics and external environment predictor variables through a literature review, and then built our prediction model using the machine learning of a BP neural network via three steps: the calculation of the node number of the implication level, a performance test of the BP neural network, and the computation of the weight of every input node. Taking the public risk perception of the Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic in China as research cases, we found that, according to our tests, the node number of the implication level was 15 in terms of the Sino-US trade friction and 14 in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, machine learning was conducted, through which we found that the R2 of the BP neural network prediction model was 0.88651 and 0.87125, respectively, for the two cases, which accurately predicted the public's risk perception of the data on a certain day, and simultaneously obtained the weight of every predictor variable in each case. In this paper, we provide comments and suggestions for building a model to predict the public's perception of topical issues."

Online search engines harvest vast amounts of data from the general population in real time and make these data publicly accessible via such tools as Google Trends (GT). Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the literature about possible use of GT for COVID-19 surveillance and prediction of its outbreaks. We collected and reviewed articles about the possible use of GT for COVID-19 surveillance published in the first 2 years of the pandemic. We resulted in 54 publications that were used in this review. The majority of the studies (83.3%) included in this review showed positive results of the possible use of GT for forecasting COVID-19 outbreaks. Most of the studies were performed in English-speaking countries (61.1%). The most frequently used keyword was ""coronavirus"" (53.7%), followed by ""COVID-19"" (31.5%) and ""COVID"" (20.4%). Many authors have made analyses in multiple countries (46.3%) and obtained the same results for the majority of them, thus showing the robustness of the chosen methods. Various methods including long short-term memory (3.7%), random forest regression (3.7%), Adaboost algorithm (1.9%), autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network autoregression (1.9%), and vector error correction modeling (1.9%) were used for the analysis. It was seen that most of the publications with positive results (72.2%) were using data from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later, the search volumes reduced even though the incidence peaked. In most countries, the use of GT data showed to be beneficial for forecasting and surveillance of COVID-19 spread."

Epub 2020 Feb 14.,Amiri AM,Accid Anal Prev,2020,2020/02/18,,,10.1016/j.aap.2020.105468,"Run-off-road (ROR) crashes have always been a major concern as this type of crash is usually associated with a considerable number of serious injury and fatal crashes. A substantial portion of ROR fatalities occur in collisions with fixed objects at the roadside. Thus, this study seeks to investigate the severity of ROR crashes where elderly drivers, aged 65 years or more, hit a fixed object. The reason why the present study investigates this issue among older drivers is that, comparing to younger drivers, this age group of drivers have different psychological and physical features. Because of these differences, they are more likely to get injured in ROR types of crashes. This paper applies two types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the crashe information of California in 2012 obtained from Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) database. Although the results showed that the developed ANN outperformed the hybrid Intelligent Genetic Algorithm, the hybrid approach was more capable of predicting high-severity crashes. This is rooted in the way the hybrid model was trained by taking advantage of the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results also indicated that the light condition has been the most significant parameter in evaluating the level of severity associated with fixed object crashes among elderly drivers, which is followed by the existence of the right and left shoulders. Following these three contributing factors, cause of collision, Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), number of involved vehicles, age, road surface condition, and gender have been identified as the most important variables in the developed ANN, respectively. This helps to identify gaps and improve public safety towards improving the overall highway safety situation of older drivers."

Using continuous remote monitoring data from cardiac implantable electronic devices, we sought to evaluate if machine learned signatures of AF burden could provide prognostic information on near-term risk of stroke when compared to conventional risk scores.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified Veterans Health Administration serviced patients with cardiac implantable electronic device remote monitoring data and at least one day of device-registered AF. The first 30 days of remote monitoring in nonstroke controls were compared against the past 30 days of remote monitoring before stroke in cases. We trained 3 types of models on our data: (1) convolutional neural networks, (2) random forest, and (3) L1 regularized logistic regression (LASSO). We calculated the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score for each patient and compared its performance against machine learned indices based on AF burden in separate test cohorts. Finally, we investigated the effect of combining our AF burden models with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We identified 3114 nonstroke controls and 71 stroke cases, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Random forest performed the best in the test data set (area under the curve [AUC]=0.662) and convolutional neural network in the validation dataset (AUC=0.702), whereas CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc had an AUC of 0.5 or less in both data sets. Combining CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc with random forest and convolutional neural network yielded a validation AUC of 0.696 and test AUC of 0.634, yielding the highest average AUC on nontraining data.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study found that machine learning and ensemble methods that incorporate daily AF burden signature provided incremental prognostic value for risk stratification beyond CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc for near-term risk of stroke."

Reviewing key factors can provide insight into priority research areas and offer suggestions for potential interventions.
MAIN BODY: Through a scoping review, we identify knowledge gaps on transmission dynamics, vectorial capacity, and co-infections regarding VBDs in urban areas. Peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016 was searched. We screened abstracts and full texts to select studies. Using an extraction grid, we retrieved general data, results, lessons learned and recommendations, future research avenues, and practice implications. We classified studies by VBD and country/continent and identified relevant knowledge gaps. Of 773 articles selected for full-text screening, 50 were included in the review: 23 based on research in the Americas, 15 in Asia, 10 in Africa, and one each in Europe and Australia. The largest body of evidence concerning VBD epidemiology in urban areas concerned dengue and malaria. Other arboviruses covered included chikungunya and West Nile virus, other parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, and bacterial rickettsiosis and plague. Most articles retrieved in our review combined transmission dynamics and vectorial capacity; only two combined transmission dynamics and co-infection. The review identified significant knowledge gaps on the role of asymptomatic individuals, the effects of co-infection and other host factors, and the impacts of climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on VBD transmission in urban areas. Limitations included the trade-off from narrowing the search strategy (missing out on classical modelling studies), a lack of studies on co-infections, most studies being only descriptive, and few offering concrete public health recommendations. More research is needed on transmission risk in homes and workplaces, given increasingly dynamic and mobile populations. The lack of studies on co-infection hampers monitoring of infections transmitted by the same vector.
CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening VBD surveillance and control, particularly in asymptomatic cases and mobile populations, as well as using early warning tools to predict increasing transmission, were key strategies identified for public health policy and practice."

Infectious disease prediction may help in disease prevention despite some uncontrollable influence factors. This study conducted a comparison between a hybrid model and two single models in forecasting the monthly incidence of HFRS in China.
DESIGN: Time-series study.
SETTING: The People's Republic of China.
METHODS: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, generalised regression neural network (GRNN) model and hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model were constructed by R V.3.4.3 software. The monthly reported incidence of HFRS from January 2011 to May 2018 were adopted to evaluate models' performance. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were adopted to evaluate these models' effectiveness. Spatial stratified heterogeneity of the time series was tested by month and another GRNN model was built with a new series.
RESULTS: The monthly incidence of HFRS in the past several years showed a slight downtrend and obvious seasonal variation. A total of four plausible ARIMA models were built and ARIMA(2,1,1) (2,1,1)<sub>12</sub> model was selected as the optimal model in HFRS fitting. The smooth factors of the basic GRNN model and the hybrid model were 0.027 and 0.043, respectively. The single ARIMA model was the best in fitting part (MAPE=9.1154, MAE=89.0302, RMSE=138.8356) while the hybrid model was the best in prediction (MAPE=17.8335, MAE=152.3013, RMSE=196.4682). GRNN model was revised by building model with new series and the forecasting performance of revised model (MAPE=17.6095, MAE=163.8000, RMSE=169.4751) was better than original GRNN model (MAPE=19.2029, MAE=177.0356, RMSE=202.1684).
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model was better than single ARIMA and basic GRNN model in forecasting monthly incidence of HFRS in China. It could be considered as a decision-making tool in HFRS prevention and control."

The National Inpatient Sample (2019) was used to identify young Asians (18-44-year-old) who were hospitalized with SCA. The neural network's predicted criteria for SCA were selected. After eliminating missing data, young Asians (n = 65,413) were randomly divided into training (n = 45,094) and testing (n = 19347) groups. Training data (70%) was used to calibrate ANN while testing data (30%) was utilized to assess the algorithm's accuracy. To determine ANN's performance in predicting SCA, we compared the frequency of incorrect prediction between training and testing data and measured the area under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC). The 2019 young Asian cohort had 327,065 admissions (median age 32 years; 84.2% female), with SCA accounting for 0.21%. The exact rate of error in predictions vs. tests was shown by training data (0.2% vs 0.2%). In descending order, the normalized importance of predictors to accurately predict SCA in young adults included prior history of cardiac arrest, sex, age, diabetes, anxiety disorders, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension, congenital heart disease, income, peripheral vascular disease, and cancer. The AUC was 0.821, indicating an excellent ANN model for SCA prediction. Our ANN models performed excellently in revealing the order of important predictors of SCA in young Asian American patients. These findings could have a considerable impact on clinical practice to develop risk prediction models to improve the survival outcome in high-risk patients."

Despite this, there is a dearth of research utilizing big data to predict UM distant metastasis. This study leveraged machine learning methods on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to forecast the risk probability of distant metastasis. Therefore, the information on UM patients from the SEER database (2000-2020) was split into a 7:3 ratio training set and an internal test set based on distant metastasis presence. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed distant metastasis risk factors. Six machine learning methods constructed a predictive model post-feature variable selection. The model evaluation identified the multilayer perceptron (MLP) as optimal. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) interpreted the chosen model. A web-based calculator personalized risk probabilities for UM patients. The results show that nine feature variables contributed to the machine learning model. The MLP model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy (Precision = 0.788; ROC AUC = 0.876; PR AUC = 0.788). Grade recode, age, primary site, time from diagnosis to treatment initiation, and total number of malignant tumors were identified as distant metastasis risk factors. Diagnostic method, laterality, rural-urban continuum code, and radiation recode emerged as protective factors. The developed web calculator utilizes the MLP model for personalized risk assessments. In conclusion, the MLP machine learning model emerges as the optimal tool for predicting distant metastasis in UM patients. This model facilitates personalized risk assessments, empowering early and tailored treatment strategies."

This study was conducted to examine a range of clinical and sociodemographic factors in relation to post-operative in-hospital deaths in colorectal cancer patients and identify whether these contributions would vary by severity of co-morbidities.
METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective cohort study, we used the complete census of New South Wales inpatient data to select colorectal cancer patients admitted to public hospitals for acute surgical care, who underwent procedures on the digestive system during the period of July 2001 to June 2014. The primary outcome was in-hospital death at the end of acute care. Multilayer perceptron and back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to quantify the relative importance of a wide range of clinical and sociodemographic factors in relation to post-operative deaths, stratified by severity of co-morbidities based on Charlson co-morbidity index.
RESULTS: Of 6288 colorectal cancer patients, approximately 58.3% (n = 3669) had moderate to severe co-morbidities. A total of 464 (7.4%) died in hospitals. The performance for ANN models was superior to logistic models. Co-morbid musculoskeletal and mental disorders, adverse events in health care, and socio-economic factors including rural residence and private insurance status contributed to post-operative deaths in hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Identification of relative importance of factors contributing to in-hospital deaths in colorectal cancer patients using ANN may help to enhance patient-centred strategies to meet complex needs during acute surgical care and prevent post-operative in-hospital deaths."

Our aim was to exploit the converging nature of the tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes epidemics to forecast TB case numbers. Thus, we extended TB prediction models based on traditional data with diabetes-related Google searches. We obtained data on the weekly case numbers of TB in Germany from June 8th, 2014, to May 5th, 2019. Internet search data were obtained from a Google Trends (GTD) search for 'diabetes' to the corresponding interval. A seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model (0,1,1) (1,0,0) [52] was selected to describe the weekly TB case numbers with and without GTD as an external regressor. We cross-validated the SARIMA models to obtain the root mean squared errors (RMSE). We repeated this procedure with autoregressive feed-forward neural network (NNAR) models using 5-fold cross-validation. To simulate a data-poor surveillance setting, we also tested traditional and GTD-extended models against a hold-out dataset using a decreased 52-week-long period with missing values for training. Cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 20.83 for the traditional model and 18.56 for the GTD-extended model. Cross-validation of the NNAR models showed a mean RMSE of 19.49 for the traditional model and 18.99 for the GTD-extended model. When we tested the models trained on a decreased dataset with missing values, the GTD-extended models achieved significantly better prediction than the traditional models (p &lt; 0.001). The GTD-extended models outperformed the traditional models in all assessed model evaluation parameters. Using online activity-based data regarding diabetes can improve TB forecasting, but further validation is warranted."

In addition to the traditional statistical analysis, data was subjected to machine learning algorithm through artificial neural network. The predictive accuracy (specificity and -1 sensitivity) on each endpoint is presented with percentage and receiver operative curve. The pattern recognition and model classification were conducted using discriminate analysis, decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes and support vector machines, and the best fit model was deployed for pattern recognition and modelling.
RESULTS: The accuracy of the training, validation and predictive ability of artificial neural network in detection of endoleak type I was 95, 96 and 94%, type II (94, 83, 90 and 82%) and type III was 96, 94 and 96%, respectively. Endpoints are associated with increase in weights through predictive modeling that were not detected through statistical analytics. The overall accuracy of the model was >86%.
CONCLUSION: The study highlights the applicability, accuracy and reliability of artificial intelligence in the detection of adverse outcomes post-EVAR for an accurate surveillance stratification."

Epub 2020 Jul 25.,Wang Y,Burns,2020,2020/08/23,,,10.1016/j.burns.2020.07.010,"INTRODUCTION: Early judgment of the depth of burns is very important for the accurate formulation of treatment plans. In medical imaging the application of Artificial Intelligence has the potential for serving as a very experienced assistant to improve early clinical diagnosis. Due to lack of large volume of a particular feature, there has been almost no progress in burn field.
METHODS: 484 early wound images are collected on patients who discharged home after a burn injury in 48 h, from five different levels of hospitals in Hunan Province China. According to actual healing time, all images are manually annotated by five professional burn surgeons and divided into three sets which are shallow(0-10 days), moderate(11-20 days) and deep(more than 21 days or skin graft healing). These ROIs were further divided into 5637 patches sizes 224 × 224 pixels, of which 1733 shallow, 1804 moderate, and 2100 deep. We used transfer learning suing a Pre-trained ResNet50 model and the ratio of all images is 7:1.5:1.5 for training:validation:test.
RESULTS: A novel artificial burn depth recognition model based on convolutional neural network was established and the diagnostic accuracy of the three types of burns is about 80%.
DISCUSSION: The actual healing time can be used to deduce the depth of burn involvement. The artificial burn depth recognition model can accurately infer healing time and burn depth of the patient, which is expected to be used for auxiliary diagnosis improvement."

However, there has been no trained preoperative ANN (preope-ANN) model to preoperatively predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (GC).
AIM: To establish a neural network model that can predict long-term survival of GC patients before surgery to evaluate the tumor condition before the operation.
METHODS: The clinicopathological data of 1608 GC patients treated from January 2011 to April 2015 at the Department of Gastric Surgery, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly divided into a training set (70%) for establishing a preope-ANN model and a testing set (30%). The prognostic evaluation ability of the preope-ANN model was compared with that of the American Joint Commission on Cancer (8th edition) clinical TNM (cTNM) and pathological TNM (pTNM) staging through the receiver operating characteristic curve, Akaike information criterion index, Harrell's C index, and likelihood ratio chi-square.
RESULTS: We used the variables that were statistically significant factors for the 3-year overall survival as input-layer variables to develop a preope-ANN in the training set. The survival curves within each score of the preope-ANN had good discrimination (P &lt; 0.05). Comparing the preope-ANN model, cTNM, and pTNM in both the training and testing sets, the preope-ANN model was superior to cTNM in predictive discrimination (C index), predictive homogeneity (likelihood ratio chi-square), and prediction accuracy (area under the curve). The prediction efficiency of the preope-ANN model is similar to that of pTNM.
CONCLUSION: The preope-ANN model can accurately predict the long-term survival of GC patients, and its predictive efficiency is not inferior to that of pTNM stage."

Epub 2020 Oct 2.,Goh GK,J Proteome Res,2020,2020/10/02,,,10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00672,"A model that predicts levels of coronavirus (CoV) respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials based on the shell disorder has been built using neural network (artificial intelligence, AI) analysis of the percentage of disorder (PID) in the nucleocapsid, N, and membrane, M, proteins of the inner and outer viral shells, respectively. Using primarily the PID of N, SARS-CoV-2 is grouped as having intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Related studies, using similar methodologies, have found strong positive correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder among numerous viruses, including Nipah, Ebola, and Dengue viruses. There is some evidence that this is also true for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which have N PIDs of 48% and 50%, and case-fatality rates of 0.5-5% and 10.9%, respectively. The underlying relationship between virulence and respiratory potentials has to do with the viral loads of vital organs and body fluids, respectively. Viruses can spread by respiratory means only if the viral loads in saliva and mucus exceed certain minima. Similarly, a patient is likelier to die when the viral load overwhelms vital organs. Greater disorder in inner shell proteins has been known to play important roles in the rapid replication of viruses by enhancing the efficiency pertaining to protein-protein/DNA/RNA/lipid bindings. This paper suggests a novel strategy in attenuating viruses involving comparison of disorder patterns of inner shells (N) of related viruses to identify residues and regions that could be ideal for mutation. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has one of the lowest M PID values (6%) in its family, and therefore, this virus has one of the hardest outer shells, which makes it resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluid. While this is likely responsible for its greater contagiousness, the risks of creating an attenuated virus with a more disordered M are discussed."

METHODS: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) were adopted to fit monthly, weekly and daily incidence of hemorrhagic fever in China from 2013 to 2018. The two models, combined and uncombined with rolling forecasts, were used to predict the incidence in 2019 to examine their stability and applicability.
RESULTS: ARIMA (2, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1)12, ARIMA (1, 1, 3) (1, 1, 1)52 and ARIMA (5, 0, 1) were selected as the best fitting ARIMA model for monthly, weekly and daily incidence series, respectively. The LSTM model with 64 neurons and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDM) for monthly incidence, 8 neurons and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) for weekly incidence, and 64 neurons and Root Mean Square Prop (RMSprop) for daily incidence were selected as the best fitting LSTM models. The values of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the models combined with rolling forecasts in 2019 were lower than those of the direct forecasting models for both ARIMA and LSTM. It was shown from the forecasting performance in 2019 that ARIMA was better than LSTM for monthly and weekly forecasting while the LSTM was better than ARIMA for daily forecasting in rolling forecasting models.
CONCLUSIONS: Both ARIMA and LSTM could be used to build a prediction model for the incidence of hemorrhagic fever. Different models might be more suitable for the incidence prediction at different time scales. The findings can provide a good reference for future selection of prediction models and establishments of early warning systems for hemorrhagic fever."

This study analyses CAD risk factors using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict CAD.
METHODS: The research data were obtained from a multi-center study, namely the Iran-premature coronary artery disease (I-PAD). The current study used the medical records of 415 patients with CAD hospitalized in Razi Hospital, Birjand, Iran, between May 2016 and June 2019. A total of 43 variables that affect CAD were selected, and the relevant data was extracted. Once the data were cleaned and normalized, they were imported into SPSS (V26) for analysis. The present study used the ANN technique.
RESULTS: The study revealed that 48% of the study population had a history of CAD, including 9.4% with premature CAD and 38.8% with CAD. The variables of age, sex, occupation, smoking, opium use, pesticide exposure, anxiety, sexual activity, and high fasting blood sugar were found to be significantly different among the three groups of CAD, premature CAD, and non-CAD individuals. The neural network achieved success with five hidden fitted layers and an accuracy of 81% in non-CAD diagnosis, 79% in premature diagnosis, and 78% in CAD diagnosis. Anxiety, acceptance, eduction and gender were the four most important factors in the ANN model.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that anxiety is a high-prevalence risk factor for CAD in the hospitalized population. There is a need to implement measures to increase awareness about the psychological factors that can be managed in individuals at high risk for future CAD."

We explored whether the AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of an external large cohort has a prediction power for AF in Korean population through a convolutional neural network (CNN).
METHODS: This study included 6358 subjects (872 cases, 5486 controls) from the Korean population GWAS data. We extracted the lists of SNPs at each p value threshold of the association statistics from three different previously reported ethnical-specific GWASs. The Korean GWAS data were divided into training (64%), validation (16%) and test (20%) sets, and a stratified K-fold cross-validation was performed and repeated five times after data shuffling.
RESULTS: The CNN-GWAS predictive power for AF had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78±0.01 based on the Japanese GWAS, AUC of 0.79±0.01 based on the European GWAS, and AUC of 0.82±0.01 based on the multiethnic GWAS, respectively. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping assigned high saliency scores for AF associated SNPs, and the PITX2 obtained the highest saliency score. The CNN-GWAS did not show AF prediction power by SNPs with non-significant p value subset (AUC 0.56±0.01) despite larger numbers of SNPs. The CNN-GWAS had no prediction power for odd-even registration numbers (AUC 0.51±0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: AF can be predicted by genetic information alone with moderate accuracy. The CNN-GWAS can be a robust and useful tool for detecting polygenic diseases by capturing the cumulative effects and genetic interactions of moderately associated but statistically significant SNPs.

This gap could be addressed by means of artificial neural networks (ANN) analysis.Methods: Retrospective observational study was carried out by means of an innovative data mining analysis-known as auto-contractive map (AutoCM)-and semantic mapping followed by Activation and Competition System on data of workers referring to an occupational-health outpatient clinic. Parameters analyzed included weight, height, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), percentage of fat mass, glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine, total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, fibrinogen, homocysteine, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and 25(OH)D.Results: The study included 309 workers. Of these, 23.6% were overweight, 40.5% were classified into the first class of obesity, 23.3% were in the second class, and 12.6% were in the third class (BMI &gt; 40 kg/m ). All mean biochemical values were in normal range, except for total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, CRP, and 25(OH)D. HbA1c was between 39 and 46 mmol/mol in 51.78%. 25(OH)D levels were sufficient in only 12.6%. Highest inverse correlation for hyperglycemia onset was with BMI and waist circumference, suggesting a protective role of 25(OH)D against their increase. AutoCM processing and the semantic map evidenced direct association of 25(OH)D with high link strength (0.99) to low CRP levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Low 25(OH)D led to changes in glucose, which affected metabolic syndrome biomarkers, first of which was homeostatic model assessment index and blood glucose, but not 25(OH)D.Conclusions: The use of ANN suggests a key role of 25(OH)D respect to all considered metabolic parameters in the development of diabetes and evidences a causation between low 25(OH)D and high glucose concentrations."

Balancing the risks and benefits of treatment should take into account these competing risks of death.
STUDY DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare database was used to identify women with stage I breast cancer undergoing operations from 2004-2012. Using neural network analysis, comorbidities associated with mortality were grouped into clinically relevant categories. Cumulative incidence graphs and Fine and Gray competing risk regression analyses were used to study the association of age, race, comorbidity groupings, and tumor variables with 3 competing mortality outcomes: dead of disease (DOD), dead of other cancers (DOC), and non-cancer death (NCD).
RESULTS: The overall cumulative incidence of mortality was 4.9% for DOD, 3.7% for DOC, and 21.3% for NCD for the 47,220 patients studied. For all patients, the 5- and 8-year probability of DOD was 3% and 4.7%, for DOC 1.9% and 3.5%, and for NCD 9.8% and 18.9%, respectively. The presence of any major comorbidity (eg cardiovascular or neurologic disorders) significantly increased the probability of NCD, and estrogen receptor status was the strongest predictor of DOD. Given patient age, comorbidity, and estrogen receptor status, an estimate of competing risks of death from DOD, DOC, and NCD can be calculated.
CONCLUSIONS: To aid clinical decision making, we quantify competing risks of death in patients with stage I breast cancer by taking into account patient age, comorbidity, and estrogen receptor status."

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was conducted within the Hamburg-City-Health-Study, an ongoing, prospective, observational study enrolling randomly selected inhabitants of the city of Hamburg aged 45-75 years. Heart failure was diagnosed per current guidelines. Using only digital electrocardiograms (ECGs), a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built to discriminate participants with and without heart failure. As comparisons, known risk variables for heart failure were fitted into a logistic regression model and a random forest classifier. Of the 5299 individuals included into this study, 318 individuals (6.0%) had heart failure. Using only the digital ECGs instead of several risk variables as an input, the CNN provided a comparable predictive accuracy for heart failure versus the logistic regression model and the random forest classifier [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75, a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.69 for the CNN; AUC 0.77, a sensitivity of 0.63 and a specificity of 0.76 for the logistic regression; AUC 0.79, a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.72 for the random forest classifier].
CONCLUSIONS: Using a CNN build on digital ECGs only and requiring no additional input, we derived a screening tool for heart failure in the general population. This could be perfectly embedded into clinical routine of general practitioners, as it builds on an already established diagnostic tool and does not require additional, time-consuming input. This could help to alleviate the underdiagnosis of heart failure."

People seek a wide variety of approaches to help them recover. A new belief, arising from a few laboratory studies, is that 'microclots' cause the symptoms of PCC. This belief has been extended outside these studies, suggesting that to recover people need plasmapheresis (an expensive process where blood is filtered outside the body). We appraised the laboratory studies, and it was clear that the term 'microclots' is incorrect to describe the phenomenon being described. The particles are amyloid and include fibrin(ogen); amyloid is not a part of a thrombus which is a mix of fibrin mesh and platelets. Initial acute COVID-19 infection is associated with clotting abnormalities; this review concerns amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in PCC only. We have reported here our appraisal of laboratory studies investigating the presence of amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in PCC, and of evidence that plasmapheresis may be an effective therapy to remove amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles for treating PCC.
OBJECTIVES: Laboratory studies review To summarize and appraise the research reports on amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles related to PCC. Randomized controlled trials review To assess the evidence of the safety and efficacy of plasmapheresis to remove amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in individuals with PCC from randomized controlled trials.
SEARCH METHODS: Laboratory studies review We searched for all relevant laboratory studies up to 27 October 2022 using a comprehensive search strategy which included the search terms 'COVID', 'amyloid', 'fibrin', 'fibrinogen'. Randomized controlled trials review We searched the following databases on 21 October 2022: Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register; MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Ovid); and BIOSIS Previews (Web of Science). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for trials in progress.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Laboratory studies review Laboratory studies that investigate the presence of amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in plasma samples from patients with PCC were eligible. This included studies with or without controls. Randomized controlled trials review Studies were eligible if they were of randomized controlled design and investigated the effectiveness or safety of plasmapheresis for removing amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles for treating PCC.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors applied study inclusion criteria to identify eligible studies and extracted data. Laboratory studies review We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using pre-developed methods for laboratory studies. We planned to perform synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) as described in our protocol. Randomized controlled trials review We planned that if we identified any eligible studies, we would assess risk of bias and report results with 95% confidence intervals. The primary outcome was recovery, measured using the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale (absence of symptoms related to the illness, ability to do usual daily activities, and a return to a previous state of health and mind).
MAIN RESULTS: Laboratory studies review We identified five laboratory studies. Amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles were identified in participants across all studies, including those with PCC, healthy individuals, and those with diabetes. The results of three studies were based on visual images of amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles, which did not quantify the amount or size of the particles identified. Formal risk of bias assessment showed concerns in how the studies were conducted and reported. This means the results were insufficient to support the belief that amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles are associated with PCC, or to determine whether there is a difference in the amount or size of amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in the plasma of people with PCC compared to healthy controls. Randomized controlled trials review We identified no trials meeting our inclusion criteria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of reliable research showing that amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles contribute to the pathophysiology of PCC, there is no rationale for plasmapheresis to remove amyloid fibrin(ogen) particles in PCC. Plasmapheresis for this indication should not be used outside the context of a well-conducted randomized controlled trial."

The purpose of this study was (1) to determine whether the frequency of onset and relapse of inflammatory bowel disease follows a seasonal pattern and (2) to establish a model to predict the frequency of onset, relapse, and severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with meteorological data based on artificial neural network (ANN).
METHOD: Patients with diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) between 2003 and 2011 were investigated according to the occurrence of onset and flares of symptoms. The expected onset or relapse was calculated on a monthly basis over the study period. For artificial neural network (ANN), patients from 2003 to 2010 were assigned as training cohort and patients in 2011 were assigned as validation cohort. Mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy.
RESULTS: We found no seasonal pattern of onset (P = 0.248) and relapse (P = 0.394) among UC patients. But, the onset (P = 0.015) and relapse (P = 0.004) of CD were associated with seasonal pattern, with a peak in July and August. ANN had average accuracy to predict the frequency of onset (MSE = 0.076, MAPE = 37.58%) and severity of IBD (MSE = 0.065, MAPE = 42.15%) but high accuracy in predicting the frequency of relapse of IBD (MSE = 0.009, MAPE = 17.1%).
CONCLUSION: The frequency of onset and relapse in IBD showed seasonality only in CD, with a peak in July and August, but not in UC. ANN may have its value in predicting the frequency of relapse among patients with IBD."

These factors were applied to predict the reality of systolic and diastolic decrease using the machine learning algorithm Naïve Bayes, artificial neural network, logistic regression, and decision tree.
RECENT FINDINGS: The increase in blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, is very harmful to the health because uncontrolled high systolic and diastolic blood pressure can cause various diseases such as congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. There have been many studies examining the factors that influence the occurrence of hypertension, but few studies have used machine learning to predict hypertension. The machine learning models performed well and can be used for predicting whether a person with hypertension with certain characteristics will experience a decrease in their systolic or diastolic blood pressure after treatment with antihypertensive drugs."

The objectives of this study were to (1) develop and evaluate blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) prediction models using multivariate linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS), and artificial neural network (ANN) methods and (2) evaluate whether milk FTIR spectrum (mFTIR)-based models are improved with the inclusion of test-day variables (mTest; milk composition and producer-reported data). Paired blood and milk samples were collected from multiparous cows 5 to 18 d postpartum at 3 Wisconsin farms (3,629 observations from 1,013 cows). Blood BHB concentration was determined by a Precision Xtra meter (Abbot Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA), and milk samples were analyzed by a privately owned laboratory (AgSource, Menomonie, WI) for components and FTIR spectrum absorbance. Producer-recorded variables were extracted from farm management software. A blood BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L was considered HYK. The data set was divided into a training set (n = 3,020) and an external testing set (n = 609). Model fitting was implemented with JMP 12 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training data set for the MLR, PLS, and ANN prediction methods, with square root of blood BHB as the dependent variable. Each method was fitted using 3 combinations of variables: mFTIR, mTest, or mTest + mFTIR variables. Models were evaluated based on coefficient of determination, root mean squared error, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Four models (PLS-mTest + mFTIR, ANN-mFTIR, ANN-mTest, and ANN-mTest + mFTIR) were chosen for further evaluation in the testing set after fitting to the full training set. In the cross-validation analysis, model fit was greatest for ANN, followed by PLS and MLR. Diagnostic strength after cross-validation was poorest for MLR and was similar for ANN and PLS. Models that used mTest + mFTIR variables performed marginally better than models that used only mFTIR or mTest variables. These results suggest that blood BHB prediction models that use mFTIR + mTest variables may be useful additions to existing HYK diagnostic and management programs."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using longitudinal electronic health record data, we assessed the relative performance of machine learning models trained to detect a future diagnosis of heart failure in primary care patients. Model performance was assessed in relation to data parameters defined by the combination of different data domains (data diversity), the number of patient records in the training data set (data quantity), the number of encounters per patient (data density), the prediction window length, and the observation window length (ie, the time period before the prediction window that is the source of features for prediction). Data on 4370 incident heart failure cases and 30 132 group-matched controls were used. Recurrent neural network model performance was superior under a variety of conditions that included (1) when data were less diverse (eg, a single data domain like medication or vital signs) given the same training size; (2) as data quantity increased; (3) as density increased; (4) as the observation window length increased; and (5) as the prediction window length decreased. When all data domains were used, the performance of recurrent neural network models increased in relation to the quantity of data used (ie, up to 100% of the data). When data are sparse (ie, fewer features or low dimension), model performance is lower, but a much smaller training set size is required to achieve optimal performance compared with conditions where data are more diverse and includes more features.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent neural networks are effective for predicting a future diagnosis of heart failure given sufficient training set size. Model performance appears to continue to improve in direct relation to training set size."

Epub 2017 Jan 20.,Wu CF,J Formos Med Assoc,2017,2017/01/25,,,10.1016/j.jfma.2016.12.006,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) provides an effective treatment for patients who exhibit early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stages or are waiting for liver transplantation. It is important to assess patients after RFA. The goal of this study was to build artificial neural network models with HCC-related variables to predict the 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients receiving RFA treatments.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective study that tracked HCC patients who received computer tomography-guided percutaneous RFA between January 2009 and April 2012. The numbers of total patients with 1-year and 2-year DFS were 252 and 179, respectively. A total of 15 HCC clinical variables were collected for the construction of artificial neural network models for DFS prediction. Internal validation and validation conducted using simulated prospective data were performed.
RESULTS: The results showed that the model with 15 inputs showed better performance compared with the models including only significant features. Parameters for performance assessment of 1-year DFS prediction were as follows: accuracy 85.0% (70.0%), sensitivity 75.0% (63.3%), specificity 87.5% (71.8%), and area under the curve 0.84 (0.77) for internal validation (simulated prospective validation). For 2-year DFS prediction, the values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 67.9% (63.9%), 50.0% (56.3%), 85.7% (70.0%), and 0.75 (0.72), respectively, for internal validation (simulated prospective validation).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the proposed artificial neural network models constructed with 15 clinical HCC relevant features could achieve an acceptable prediction performance for DFS. Such models can support clinical physicians to deal with clinical decision-making processes on the prognosis of HCC patients receiving RFA treatments."

Due to the potential impact of adverse effects on treatment decisions and patient outcomes, careful consideration of the varying toxicities of CDK4/6 inhibitors is crucial, as three inhibitors-palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib-have been approved with differences in adverse event profiles. However, limitations in clinical trials call for urgent real-world safety studies to evaluate and compare the risk of adverse events (AEs) among these CDK4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze AEs of CDK4/6 inhibitors and provide insights for clinical drug selection, using real world database.
METHODS: The AEs of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (2015-2022) were analyzed. Four disproportionality methods were used to detect safety signals: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio, Bayesian Confidence Neural Network Propagation, and Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker. Venn analysis was used to compare and select common and specific AEs.
RESULTS: This study included 73,042 patients treated with palbociclib, 25,142 with ribociclib, and 7563 with abemaciclib. All three inhibitors had 27 common AEs. Palbociclib exhibited the highest ROR for hematologic toxicities, while ribociclib showed the highest ROR for macrocytosis, nail disorders, and hepatic lesions. Abemaciclib displayed the highest ROR for mucosal toxicity. Common signals for both palbociclib and ribociclib included hematologic toxicities, decreased immune responsiveness, and aphthous ulcers. Myelosuppression, oral pain, and pseudocirrhosis were common signals for palbociclib and abemaciclib. Anemia, hepatotoxicity, and pneumonitis were observed as common signals for ribociclib and abemaciclib. Furthermore, specific AEs associated with palbociclib included fatigue, alopecia, and stomatitis. For ribociclib, specific AEs included electrocardiogram QT prolongation, thrombocytopenia, and decreased hemoglobin. Abemaciclib was specifically linked to diarrhea, vomiting, and interstitial lung disease.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed that palbociclib showed a higher risk of hematologic toxicity. Ribociclib showed higher risks of hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and QT prolongation. Abemaciclib showed higher risks of hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal effects, interstitial lung disease, and thrombosis. These findings provide valuable insights for CDK4/6 inhibitor selection."

The present study investigated the accuracy of support vector machine, artificial neural-network, and random-forest time series models in influenza like illness (ILI) modeling and outbreaks detection. The models were applied to a data set of weekly ILI frequencies in Iran. The root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE), and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics were employed as evaluation criteria.
RESULTS: It was indicated that the random-forest time series model outperformed other three methods in modeling weekly ILI frequencies (RMSE = 22.78, MAE = 14.99 and ICC = 0.88 for the test set). In addition neural-network was better in outbreaks detection with total accuracy of 0.889 for the test set. The results showed that the used time series models had promising performances suggesting they could be effectively applied for predicting weekly ILI frequencies and outbreaks."

Moreover, it requires continuous outpatient treatment for the patient to maintain abstinence. However, with a low probability of these patients to continue outpatient treatment, predicting and managing patients who might discontinue treatment becomes necessary. Accordingly, we developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict which the risk of patients dropping out of outpatient treatment schemes.
METHODS: A total of 839 patients were selected out of 2,206 patients admitted for AUD in three hospitals under the Catholic Central Medical Center in Korea. We implemented six ML models-logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, neural network, and AdaBoost-and compared the prediction performances thereof.
RESULTS: Among the six models, AdaBoost was selected as the final model for recommended use owing to its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.72. The four variables affecting the prediction based on feature importance were the length of hospitalization, age, residential area, and diabetes.
CONCLUSION: An ML algorithm was developed herein to predict the risk of patients with AUD in Korea discontinuing outpatient treatment. By testing and validating various machine learning models, we determined the best performing model, AdaBoost, as the final model for recommended use. Using this model, clinicians can manage patients with high risks of discontinuing treatment and establish patient-specific treatment strategies. Therefore, our model can potentially enable patients with AUD to successfully complete their treatments by identifying them before they can drop out."

MDA is currently WHO policy for areas endemic with lymphatic filariasis, which is a parasitic disease that can result in swollen limbs and disability. The success depends on communities adhering to the drugs given, and this will be influenced by the perception of the drug, the programme, and those delivering it.  OBJECTIVES: To synthesize qualitative research evidence about community experience with, and understanding and perception of, MDA programmes for lymphatic filariasis. To explore whether programme design and delivery influence the community experience identified in the analysis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases up to 8 April 2021, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: This review synthesized qualitative research and mixed-methods studies when it was possible to extract qualitative data. Eligible studies explored community experiences, perceptions, or attitudes towards MDA programmes for lymphatic filariasis in any country, conducted between 2000 and 2019.  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on study design including: authors, aims, participants, methods, and qualitative data collection methods. We also described programme delivery factors including: country, urban or rural setting, endemicity, drug regimen, rounds of MDA received at the time of the study, who delivered the drugs, how the drugs were delivered, use of health education, and sensitization and adherence monitoring. We conducted a thematic analysis and developed codes inductively using ATLAS.ti software. We examined codes for underlying ideas, connections, and interpretations and, from this, generated analytical themes. We assessed the confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual approach, and produced a conceptual model to display our findings.  MAIN RESULTS: From 902 results identified in the search, 29 studies met our inclusion criteria. The studies covered a broad range of countries in Africa, South-East Asia, and South America, and explored the views and experiences of community members and community drug distributors in low-income countries endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Four themes emerged. People weigh up benefits and harms before participating. People understand the potential benefits in terms of relief of suffering, stigma, and avoiding costs (high confidence); however, these theoretical benefits do not always mesh with their experiences (high confidence). In particular, adverse effects are frightening and unwelcome (high confidence); and these effects are amplified through rumour and social media (moderate confidence). Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes. When people lack a scientific explanation for the programme and their experiences of it, they often develop social explanations instead. These are largely shaped on the historical backdrop and level of trust people have in relevant authority figures (high confidence), although some have unwavering faith in their government and, by extension, the programme (moderate confidence). Programmes expect compliance, and this can become coercive and blaming. Health workers and community members stigmatize non-compliance, which can become coercive (moderate confidence), so communities may appear to comply publicly, but privately reject treatment (moderate confidence). Community distributors are often not respected or valued. They have little authority (moderate confidence), and the behaviour of some distributors damages the MDA programme's reputation (high confidence). Communities want information about programmes to help make decisions about participation, but drug distributors are not sufficiently informed, or skilled in this communication (high confidence). We intended to assess whether programme designs influenced communities' perceptions of the programme and decision to adhere but were unable to do so as few studies adequately reported the design and implementation of the local programme. We have moderate to high confidence in the evidence contributing to the review themes and subthemes.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Adherence with MDA for filariasis is influenced by individual direct experience of benefit and harm; social influences in the community; political influences and their relationship to government; and historical influences. Fear of adverse effects was frequently described and this appears to be particularly important for communities. When views were negative, we were surprised by the strength of feeling expressed. Enthusiasm for these schemes as a strategy in global policy needs debate in the light of these findings."

Nonetheless, recent neuroimaging studies indicated that longer gestation is also associated with better functioning of the child's brain.
AIMS: to assess whether longer gestation in term and post-term (in short: term) singletons is associated with better infant neurodevelopment.
STUDY DESIGN: cross-sectional observational study.
SUBJECTS: Participants were all singleton term infants (n = 1563) aged 2-18 months of the IMP-SINDA project that collected normative data for the Infant Motor Profile (IMP) and Standardized Infant NeuroDevelopmental Assessment (SINDA). The group was representative of the Dutch population.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Total IMP score was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were atypical total IMP scores (scores <15th percentile) and SINDA's neurological and developmental scores.
RESULTS: Duration of gestation had a quadratic relationship with IMP and SINDA developmental scores. IMP scores were lowest at a gestation of 38·5 weeks, SINDA developmental scores at 38·7 weeks. Next, both scores increased with increasing duration of gestation. Infants born at 41-42 weeks had significantly less often atypical IMP scores (adjusted OR [95 % CI]: 0·571 [0·341-0·957] and atypical SINDA developmental scores (adjusted OR: 0·366 [0·195-0·688]) than infants born at 39-40 weeks. Duration of gestation was not associated with SINDA's neurological score.
CONCLUSIONS: In term singleton infants representative of the Dutch population longer gestation is associated with better infant neurodevelopment scores suggesting better neural network efficiency. Longer gestation in term infants is not associated with atypical neurological scores."

Epub 2020 Jun 9.,Arvind V,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,2021,2020/09/02,,,10.1016/j.jse.2020.05.013,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) techniques have been shown to successfully predict postoperative complications for high-volume orthopedic procedures such as hip and knee arthroplasty and to stratify patients for risk-adjusted bundled payments. The latter has not been done for more heterogeneous, lower-volume procedures such as total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) with equally limited discussion around strategies to optimize the predictive ability of ML algorithms. The purpose of this study was to (1) assess which of 5 ML algorithms best predicts 30-day readmission, (2) test select ML strategies to optimize the algorithms, and (3) report on which patient variables contribute most to risk prediction in TSA across algorithms.
METHODS: We identified 9043 patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Database who underwent primary TSA between 2011 and 2015. Predictors included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data, and intraoperative variables. The outcome of interest was 30-day unplanned readmission. Five ML algorithms-support-vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, random forest (RF), an adaptive boosting algorithm, and neural network-were trained on the derivation cohort (2011-2014 TSA patients) to predict 30-day unplanned readmission rates. After training, weights for each respective model were fixed and the classifiers were evaluated on the 2015 TSA cohort to simulate a prospective evaluation. C-statistic and f1 scores were used to assess the performance of each classifier. After evaluation, features were removed independently to assess which features most affected classifier performance.
RESULTS: The derivation and validation cohorts comprised 5857 and 3186 primary TSA patients, respectively, with similar demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day unplanned readmission rates (2.9% vs. 2.7%). Of the ML algorithms, SVM performed the worst with a c-statistic of 0.54 and an f1-score of 0.07, whereas the random-forest classifier performed the best with the highest c-statistic of 0.74 and an f1-score of 0.18. In addition, SVM was most sensitive to loss of single features, whereas the performance of RF did not dramatically decrease after loss of single features. Within the trained RF classifier, 5 variables achieved weights >0.5 in descending order: high bilirubin (>1.9 mg/dL), age >65, race, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists' scores ≥3. In our validation cohort, we observed a 2.7% readmission rate. From this cohort, using the RF classifier we were then able to identify 436 high-risk patients with a predicted risk score >0.6, of whom 36 were readmitted (readmission rate of 8.2%).
CONCLUSION: Predictive analytics algorithms can achieve acceptable prediction of unplanned readmission for TSA with the RF classifier outperforming other common algorithms."

We previously developed an APO prediction model using logistic regression and data from Predictors of pRegnancy Outcome: bioMarkers In Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (PROMISSE), a large multicentre study of pregnant women with mild/moderate SLE and/or antiphospholipid antibodies. Our goal was to determine whether machine learning (ML) approaches improve APO prediction and identify other risk factors.
METHODS: The PROMISSE data included 41 predictors from 385 subjects; 18.4% had APO (preterm delivery due to placental insufficiency/pre-eclampsia, fetal/neonatal death, fetal growth restriction). Logistic regression with stepwise selection (LR-S), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), support vector machines (SVM-RBF), gradient boosting (GB) and SuperLearner (SL) were compared by cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC) and calibration.
RESULTS: Previously identified APO risk factors, antihypertensive medication use, low platelets, SLE disease activity and lupus anticoagulant (LAC), were confirmed as important with each algorithm. LASSO additionally revealed potential interactions between LAC and anticardiolipin IgG, among others. SL performed the best (AUC=0.78), but was statistically indistinguishable from LASSO, SVM-RBF and RF (AUC=0.77 for all). LR-S, NN and GB had worse AUC (0.71-0.74) and calibration scores.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted APO with reasonable accuracy using variables routinely assessed prior to the 12th week of pregnancy. LASSO and some ML methods performed better than a standard logistic regression approach. Substantial improvement in APO prediction will likely be realised, not with increasingly complex algorithms but by the discovery of new biomarkers and APO risk factors."

In this prospective multi-center study, 296 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and split into the General-Ward-Care group (N = 238) and the ICU-Admission group (N = 58). The PSI model (AUC = 0.861) had the best results among the existing four scoring systems, followed by SMARTCOP (AUC = 0.770), motified-MuLBSTA (AUC = 0.761), and CURB-65 (AUC = 0.712). Data from 197 patients (training set) were analyzed for modeling. The beta coefficients from logistic regression were used to develop a severity prediction model and risk score calculator. The final model (NLHA2) included five covariates (consumes alcohol, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, and AKP). The NLHA2 model (training: AUC = 0.959; testing: AUC = 0.857) had similar results to the PSI model, but with fewer variable items. ANN analysis was used to build another complex model, which had higher accuracy (training: AUC = 1.000; testing: AUC = 0.907). Discrimination and calibration were further verified through bootstrapping (2000 replicates), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit testing, and Brier score calculation. In conclusion, the PSI model is the best existing system for predicting ICU admission among COVID-19 patients, while two newly-designed models (NLHA2 and ANN) performed better than PSI, and will provide a new approach for the development of prognostic evaluation system in a novel respiratory viral epidemic."

This study aimed to examine the natural history of fatal EV-A71 infection and to identify the symptoms and signs of early warning of deterioration. This was a clinical observational study of fatal cases of EV-A71 infection treated at five Chinese hospitals between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012. We recorded and analysed 91 manifestations of EV-A71 infection in order to identify early prognosis indicators. There were 54 fatal cases. Median age was 21.5 months (Q1-Q3: 12-36). The median duration from onset to death was 78.5 h (range, 6 to 432). The multilayer perceptron analysis showed that ataxia respiratory, ultrahyperpyrexia, excessive tachycardia, refractory shock, absent pharyngeal reflex, irregular respiratory rhythm, hyperventilation, deep coma, pulmonary oedema and/or haemorrhage, excessive hypertension, tachycardia, somnolence, CRT extension, fatigue or sleepiness and age were associated with death. Autopsy findings (n = 2) showed neuronal necrosis, softening, perivascular cuffing, colloid and neuronophagia phenomenon in the brainstem. The fatal cases of enterovirus A71 had neurologic involvement, even at the early stage. Direct virus invasion through the neural pathway and subsequent brainstem damage might explain the rapid progression to death."

Epub 2019 Nov 2.,Santos HGD,J Crit Care,2020,2019/11/13,,,10.1016/j.jcrc.2019.10.015,"PURPOSE: To develop and compare the predictive performance of machine-learning algorithms to estimate the risk of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lower than or equal to 30 days (30-day QALY).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six machine-learning algorithms were applied to predict 30-day QALY for 777 patients admitted in a prospective cohort study conducted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of two public Brazilian hospitals specialized in cancer care. The predictors were 37 characteristics collected at ICU admission. Discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Sensitivity, 1-specificity, true/false positive and negative cases were measured for different estimated probability cutoff points (30%, 20% and 10%). Calibration was evaluated with GiViTI calibration belt and test.
RESULTS: Except for basic decision trees, the adjusted predictive models were nearly equivalent, presenting good results for discrimination (AUROC curves over 0.80). Artificial neural networks and gradient boosted trees achieved the overall best calibration, implying an accurately predicted probability for 30-day QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Except for basic decision trees, predictive models derived from different machine-learning algorithms discriminated the QALY risk at 30 days well. Regarding calibration, artificial neural network model presented the best ability to estimate 30-day QALY in critically ill oncologic patients admitted to ICUs."

This study presents a comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis of the post-marketing safety profile of EV in the real-world based on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).
METHODS: Adverse event (AE) reports regarding EV between January 2020 and December 2023 were obtained from the FAERS database. The standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) narrow search AEs on the preferred term (PT) level were used. Disproportionality analysis was performed to identify the AE signals for EV with the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN).
RESULTS: A total of 2,216 reports regarding EV were included in the present study. SMQ analysis results indicated that a stronger strength signal was found in severe cutaneous adverse reactions, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and peripheral neuropathy. A total of 116 significant disproportionality PTs referring to 14 system organ classes (SOCs) were retained by disproportionality analysis, with 49 PTs not listed on the EV drug label. Frequently reported EV-related AEs included rash, peripheral neuropathy, decreased appetite, alopecia, and pruritus. The time to onset of the majority of EV-related AEs was within 30 days (66.05%), with only 0.73% events occurring after 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The disproportionality analysis highlights that dermatologic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy were the major AEs induced by EV. The potential AEs not listed on the drug label were mainly related to gastrointestinal, hepatic, and pulmonary events. Further research is needed to confirm and explore the EV-related AEs in clinical practice."

Epub 2015 Nov 20.,Hossain S,Neonatology,2016,2015/11/20,,,10.1159/000441272,"BACKGROUND: Very preterm infants born outside tertiary centers are at higher risks of adverse outcomes than inborn infants. Regionalization of perinatal care has been introduced worldwide to improve outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk-adjusted outcomes of both inborn and outborn infants cared for in tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand and in Canada.
METHODS: Deidentified data of infants <32 weeks' gestational age from the 29 Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network units (ANZNN; n = 9,893) and 26 Canadian Neonatal Network units (CNN; n = 7,133) between 2005 and 2007 were analyzed for predischarge adverse outcomes.
RESULTS: ANZNN had lower rates of outborns compared to CNN (13 vs. 19%), particularly of late admissions (>2 days of age; 5.8 vs. 22.2% of outborns) who had high morbidity rates. After adjusting for confounding variables including gestation, ANZNN inborn infants had lower odds of chronic lung disease [CLD; 17.0 vs. 23.3%; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64-0.77], severe neurological injuries on ultrasound (SNI; 4.1 vs. 6.7%; AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.53-0.73), severe retinopathy (5.6 vs. 7%; AOR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.59-0.84) and necrotizing enterocolitis (3.5 vs. 5.4%; AOR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.79), but no difference in mortality odds. After excluding the late outborn admissions, ANZNN outborns had lower odds of SNI (AOR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.32-0.58) and CLD (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49-0.81) than CNN.
CONCLUSIONS: ANZNN inborn and early admitted outborn infants had lower odds of neonatal morbidities than their CNN counterparts. However, compared to ANZNN, the higher CNN rates of outborns and their late admissions are likely related to the differences in regionalization and referral practices, and may explain differences in outcomes."

However, the predictive factors and models employed in different studies vary greatly. Hence, we conducted a systematic review to summarize machine learning methods and predictors in previous studies. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases for articles published up to July 2023. The selected papers included not only the forecast of dengue incidence but also machine learning methods. A total of 23 papers were included in this study. Predictive factors included meteorological factors (22, 95.7%), historical dengue data (14, 60.9%), environmental factors (4, 17.4%), socioeconomic factors (4, 17.4%), vector surveillance data (2, 8.7%), and internet search data (3, 13.0%). Among meteorological factors, temperature (20, 87.0%), rainfall (20, 87.0%), and relative humidity (14, 60.9%) were the most commonly used. We found that Support Vector Machine (SVM) (6, 26.1%), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (5, 21.7%), Random Forest (RF) (4, 17.4%), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) (2, 8.7%), ensemble model (2, 8.7%), and other models (4, 17.4%) were identified as the best models based on evaluation metrics used in each article. These results indicate that meteorological factors are important predictors that cannot be ignored and SVM and LSTM algorithms are the most commonly used models in dengue fever prediction with good predictive performance. This review will contribute to the development of more robust early dengue warning systems and promote the application of machine learning methods in predicting climate-related infectious diseases."

The signals detected with the three methods were classified according to their intensity, always with the most intense signal in the first position. Among the signals detected by the three methods, the positions of each signal were summed to obtain an aggregated classification that considered the results of the three methods and allowed a serial interpretation. Among the 531 reports, 20 types of AE; 88 product-AE binomials were identified. From the total of reports, seven were signs identified by the three methods. The classification of AE following explicit criteria and the combined use of more than one signal detection method enhances spontaneous-reports-based pharmacovigilance."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and October 2018, this multicenter retrospective study included 299 patients with MBOs who underwent PTBS. The training set consisted of 166 patients from four cohorts, and another two independent cohorts were allocated as external validation sets A and B with 75 patients and 58 patients, respectively. A logistic model and an artificial neural network (ANN) model were developed to predict the risk of 30-day mortality after PTBS. The predictive performance of these two models was validated internally and externally.
RESULTS: The ANN model had higher values of area under the curve than the logistic model in the training set (0.819 vs 0.797), especially in the validation sets A (0.802 vs 0.714) and B (0.732 vs 0.568). Both models had high accuracy in the three sets (75.9-83.1%). Along with a high specificity, the ANN model improved the sensitivity. The net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement also demonstrated that the ANN model led to improvements in predictive ability compared with the logistic model.
CONCLUSIONS: Early warning models were proposed to predict the risk of 30-day mortality after PTBS in patients with MBO. The ANN model has higher accuracy and better generalizability than the logistic model."

We aimed to use a novel approach that applied different machine learning models to not only predict birth outcomes but systematically quantify the impacts of pre- and post-conception serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and other predictive characteristics on birth outcomes.
METHODS: We used data from women who gave birth in Shanghai First Maternal and Infant Hospital from 2014 to 2015. We included 14,110 women with the measurement of preconception TSH in the first analysis and 3,428 out of 14,110 women with both pre- and post-conception TSH measurement in the second analysis. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to adjust the imbalance of outcomes. We randomly split (7:3) the data into a training set and a test set in both analyses. We compared Area Under Curve (AUC) for dichotomous outcomes and macro F1 score for categorical outcomes among four machine learning models, including logistic model, random forest model, XGBoost model, and multilayer neural network models to assess model performance. The model with the highest AUC or macro F1 score was used to quantify the importance of predictive features for adverse birth outcomes with the loss function algorithm.
RESULTS: The XGBoost model provided prominent advantages in terms of improved performance and prediction of polytomous variables. Predictive models with abnormal preconception TSH or not-well-controlled TSH, a novel indicator with pre- and post-conception TSH levels combined, provided the similar robust prediction for birth outcomes. The highest AUC of 98.7% happened in XGBoost model for predicting low Apgar score with not-well-controlled TSH adjusted. By loss function algorithm, we found that not-well-controlled TSH ranked 4th, 6th, and 7th among 14 features, respectively, in predicting birthweight, induction, and preterm birth, and 3rd among 19 features in predicting low Apgar score.
CONCLUSIONS: Our four machine learning models offered valid predictions of birth outcomes in women during pre- and post-conception. The predictive features panel suggested the combined TSH indicator (not-well-controlled TSH) could be a potentially competitive biomarker to predict adverse birth outcomes."

The aim of our study was to identify dietary related risk factors of central obesity based on WHtR. We used cross-sectional data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) in 2011 obtained from 2881 married women aged 19-55. The association of dietary related factors and central obesity was analyzed using binary logistic regression and back-propagation artificial neural network. Overall, central obesity prevalence was 48.4% (1394/2881). Compared to the population of women without central obesity, the population of women with central obesity had an older average age (41.84 ± 6.89 years vs 38.45 ± 7.91 years, P < 0.001), and meanwhile an average lower per capita annual income (13904 ± 15916 CNY vs 16753 ± 19163 CNY, P < 0.001). Our analysis indicated that the score of dietary knowledge (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.956; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.936-0.976) and the score of food preferences (aOR, 0.961; 95% CI, 0.926-0.997) were significantly associated with lower risk of central obesity; whereas fast food (aOR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.000-1.003) was associated with higher risk of central obesity. The study showed the score of dietary knowledge (15.5%), fast foods (10.2%), and the score of food preferences (8.8%) were the most important modifiable factors for central obesity. In summary, aging, fast food intake, and lower per capita annual income were positively associated with higher prevalence of central obesity, while higher scores of dietary knowledge and food preferences were negatively correlated. More nutrition education programs should be implemented by the government to strengthen the pro-healthy dietary behaviors."

No prior scoping review has been undertaken to comprehensively assess tools in this subspecialty.
PURPOSE: To map the evolution and current state of trauma radiology CAD tools along key dimensions of technology readiness.
METHODS: Following a search of databases, abstract screening, and full-text document review, CAD tool maturity was charted using elements of data curation, performance validation, outcomes research, explainability, user acceptance, and funding patterns. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate key trends.
RESULTS: A total of 4052 records were screened, and 233 full-text articles were selected for content analysis. Twenty-one papers described FDA-approved commercial tools, and 212 reported algorithm prototypes. Works ranged from foundational research to multi-reader multi-case trials with heterogeneous external data. Scalable convolutional neural network-based implementations increased steeply after 2016 and were used in all commercial products; however, options for explainability were narrow. Of FDA-approved tools, 9/10 performed detection tasks. Dataset sizes ranged from < 100 to > 500,000 patients, and commercialization coincided with public dataset availability. Cross-sectional torso datasets were uniformly small. Data curation methods with ground truth labeling by independent readers were uncommon. No papers assessed user acceptance, and no method included human-computer interaction. The USA and China had the highest research output and frequency of research funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Trauma imaging CAD tools are likely to improve patient care but are currently in an early stage of maturity, with few FDA-approved products for a limited number of uses. The scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a major barrier."

Here we describe efforts to compile and disseminate epidemiological information on COVID-19 from news media and social networks.
METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we searched DXY.cn, a health-care-oriented social network that is currently streaming news reports on COVID-19 from local and national Chinese health agencies. We compiled a list of individual patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, in China. We also compiled a list of internationally exported cases of COVID-19 from global news media sources (Kyodo News, The Straits Times, and CNN), national governments, and health authorities. We assessed trends in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and studied the outbreak progression across China, assessing delays between symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and reporting, before and after Jan 18, 2020, as awareness of the outbreak increased. All data were made publicly available in real time.
FINDINGS: We collected data for 507 patients with COVID-19 reported between Jan 13 and Jan 31, 2020, including 364 from mainland China and 143 from outside of China. 281 (55%) patients were male and the median age was 46 years (IQR 35-60). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years and the age profile of Chinese patients adjusted for baseline demographics confirmed a deficit of infections among children. Across the analysed period, delays between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic were longer in Hubei province than in other provinces in mainland China and internationally. In mainland China, these delays decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter until Jan 31, 2020 (p=0·0009). Although our sample captures only 507 (5·2%) of 9826 patients with COVID-19 reported by official sources during the analysed period, our data align with an official report published by Chinese authorities on Jan 28, 2020.
INTERPRETATION: News reports and social media can help reconstruct the progression of an outbreak and provide detailed patient-level data in the context of a health emergency. The availability of a central physician-oriented social network facilitated the compilation of publicly available COVID-19 data in China. As the outbreak progresses, social media and news reports will probably capture a diminishing fraction of COVID-19 cases globally due to reporting fatigue and overwhelmed health-care systems. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of public datasets is important to encourage analytical efforts by independent teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions.

This study describes and compares two methods for predicting near-term SARS-CoV-2 incidence in West Virginia counties. The first method, Rt Only, is solely based on producing forecasts for each county using the daily instantaneous reproductive numbers, Rt. The second method, ML+Rt, is a machine learning approach that uses a Long Short-Term Memory network to predict the near-term number of cases for each county using epidemiological statistics such as Rt, county population information, and time series trends including information on major holidays, as well as leveraging statewide COVID-19 trends across counties and county population size. Both approaches used daily county-level SARS-CoV-2 incidence data provided by the West Virginia Department Health and Human Resources beginning April 2020. The methods are compared on the accuracy of near-term SARS-CoV-2 increases predictions by county over 17 weeks from January 1, 2021- April 30, 2021. Both methods performed well (correlation between forecasted number of cases and the actual number of cases week over week is 0.872 for the ML+Rt method and 0.867 for the Rt Only method) but differ in performance at various time points. Over the 17-week assessment period, the ML+Rt method outperforms the Rt Only method in identifying larger spikes. Results show that both methods perform adequately in both rural and non-rural predictions. Finally, a detailed discussion on practical issues regarding implementing forecasting models for public health action based on Rt is provided, and the potential for further development of machine learning methods that are enhanced by Rt."

AKI onset is highly variable in hospitals, which makes it difficult to time biomarker assessment in all patients for preemptive care.
OBJECTIVE: The study sought to apply machine learning techniques to electronic health records and predict hospital-acquired AKI by a 48-hour lead time, with the aim to create an AKI surveillance algorithm that is deployable in real time.
METHODS: The data were sourced from 20,732 case admissions in 16,288 patients over 1 year in our institution. We enhanced the bidirectional recurrent neural network model with a novel time-invariant and time-variant aggregated module to capture important clinical features temporal to AKI in every patient. Time-series features included laboratory parameters that preceded a 48-hour prediction window before AKI onset; the latter's corresponding reference was the final in-hospital serum creatinine performed in case admissions without AKI episodes.
RESULTS: The cohort was of mean age 53 (SD 25) years, of whom 29%, 12%, 12%, and 53% had diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cancers, and baseline eGFR &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. There were 911 AKI episodes in 869 patients. We derived and validated an algorithm in the testing dataset with an AUROC of 0.81 (0.78-0.85) for predicting AKI. At a 15% prediction threshold, our model generated 699 AKI alerts with 2 false positives for every true AKI and predicted 26% of AKIs. A lowered 5% prediction threshold improved the recall to 60% but generated 3746 AKI alerts with 6 false positives for every true AKI. Representative interpretation results produced by our model alluded to the top-ranked features that predicted AKI that could be categorized in association with sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, nephrotoxicity, or multiorgan injury, specific to every case at risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We generated an accurate algorithm from electronic health records through machine learning that predicted AKI by a lead time of at least 48 hours. The prediction threshold could be adjusted during deployment to optimize recall and minimize alert fatigue, while its precision could potentially be augmented by targeted AKI biomarker assessment in the high-risk cohort identified."

Epub 2020 Jun 1.,Tada K,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,2020,2020/06/04,,,10.1007/s00228-020-02909-w,"PURPOSE: A Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) is a signal detection method used by the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre to analyze spontaneous reporting system databases. We modify the BCPNN to increase its sensitivity for detecting potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
METHOD: In a BCPNN, the information component (IC) is defined as an index of disproportionality between the observed and expected number of reported drugs and events. Our proposed method adjusts the IC value by borrowing information about events that have occurred in drugs defined as similar to the target drug. We compare the performance of our method with that of a traditional BCPNN through a simulation study.
RESULTS: The false positive rate of the proposed method was lower than that of the traditional BCPNN method and close to the nominal value, 0.025, around the true difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs equal to 0. The sensitivity of the proposed method was much higher than that of the traditional BCPNN method in case in which the difference in ICs between the target drug and similar drugs ranges from 0 to 2. When applied to a database managed by Japanese regulatory authority, the proposed method could detect known ADRs earlier than the traditional method.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is a novel criterion for early detection of signals if similar drugs have the same tendencies. The proposed BCPNN tends to have higher sensitivity when the true difference is greater than 0."

Although recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations are important predictors of outcome, 50% to 70% of AMLs harbor normal or risk-indeterminate karyotypes. Therefore, identifying more effective biomarkers predictive of treatment success and failure is essential for informing tailored therapeutic decisions. We applied an artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning approach to a publicly available data set for a discovery cohort of 593 adults with nonpromyelocytic AML. ANN analysis identified a parsimonious 3-gene expression signature comprising CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1, which was predictive of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). We computed a prognostic index (PI) using normalized gene-expression levels and β-values from subsequently created Cox proportional hazards models, coupled with clinically established prognosticators. Our 3-gene PI separated the adult patients in each European LeukemiaNet cytogenetic risk category into subgroups with different survival probabilities and identified patients with very high-risk features, such as those with a high PI and either FLT3 internal tandem duplication or nonmutated nucleophosmin 1. The PI remained significantly associated with poor EFS and OS after adjusting for established prognosticators, and its ability to stratify survival was validated in 3 independent adult cohorts (n = 905 subjects) and 1 cohort of childhood AML (n = 145 subjects). Further in silico analyses established that AML was the only tumor type among 39 distinct malignancies for which the concomitant upregulation of CALCRL, CD109, and LSP1 predicted survival. Therefore, our ANN-derived 3-gene signature refines the accuracy of patient stratification and the potential to significantly improve outcome prediction."

We focus on weekly dengue fever (DF) incidence rates in Singapore and demonstrate the strong negative correlation between an appropriately time-lagged total weekly rainfall and DF incidence. A Bayesian neural network time-series model for predicting DF incidence which utilizes rainfall data is introduced. A comparison is made between this neural network model and a time-series model which does not use any covariate information. An easily implementable method for choosing between the models which optimizes future prediction accuracy is suggested as well. We note that our proposed comparison method is applicable to any competing time-series models. This algorithm is demonstrated through examples of comparisons between pairs of different time-series models.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of a convolutional neural network trained for the detection of diabetic retinopathy and estimation of its severity in fundus images of the Russian population.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional multicenter study, the training data set was obtained from an open source and relabeled by a group of independent retina specialists; the sample size was 60,000 eyes. The test sample was recruited prospectively, 1186 fundus photographs of 593 patients were collected. The reference standard was the result of independent grading of the diabetic retinopathy stage by ophthalmologists.
RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity were 95.0% (95% CI; 90.8-96.4) and 96.8% (95% CI; 95.5- 99.0), respectively; positive predictive value - 98.8% (95% CI; 97.6-99.2); negative predictive value - 87.1% (95% CI, 83.4-96.5); accuracy - 95.9% (95% CI; 93.3-97.1); Kappa score - 0.887 (95% CI; 0.839-0.946); F1score - 0.909 (95% CI; 0.870-0.957); area under the ROC-curve - 95.9% (95% CI; 93.3-97.1). There was no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the group with isolated diabetic retinopathy and those with hypertensive retinopathy as a concomitant diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The method for diagnosing DR presented in this article has shown its high accuracy, which is consistent with the existing world analogues, however, this method should prove its clinical efficiency in large multicenter multinational controlled randomized studies, in which the reference diagnostic method would be unified and less subjective than an ophthalmologist."

Given the complex nature of this disease, which has many non-linear associations with outcomes, we explored artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the complex interactions between the risk factors of PPU and death among patients with this condition.
METHODS: ANN modelling using a standard feed-forward, back-propagation neural network with three layers (i.e., an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer) was used to predict the 30-day mortality of consecutive patients from a population-based cohort undergoing surgery for PPU. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess model accuracy.
RESULTS: Of the 172 patients, 168 had their data included in the model; the data of 117 (70%) were used for the training set, and the data of 51 (39%) were used for the test set. The accuracy, as evaluated by area under the ROC curve (AUC), was best for an inclusive, multifactorial ANN model (AUC 0.90, 95% CIs 0.85-0.95; p < 0.001). This model outperformed standard predictive scores, including Boey and PULP. The importance of each variable decreased as the number of factors included in the ANN model increased.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of death was most accurate when using an ANN model with several univariate influences on the outcome. This finding demonstrates that PPU is a highly complex disease for which clinical prognoses are likely difficult. The incorporation of computerised learning systems might enhance clinical judgments to improve decision making and outcome prediction."

Epub 2014 Oct 27.,Kim M,Geriatr Gerontol Int,2015,2014/10/28,,,10.1111/ggi.12384,"AIM: The purpose of the present study was to examine the agreement of segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (SMF-BIA) for the assessment of whole-body and appendicular fat mass (FM) and lean soft tissue mass (LSTM) compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a community-dwelling Japanese older population.
METHODS: The study population included 551 community-dwelling Japanese older adults (241 men and 310 women) aged between 65 and 87 years. Agreement between SMF-BIA and DXA for whole-body and appendicular body composition was assessed using simple linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: High coefficients of determination (R(2)) were observed for whole-body FM (R(2) = 0.91, standard error of estimate [SEE] = 1.4 kg in men and R(2) = 0.94, SEE = 1.2 kg in women) between SMF-BIA and DXA. The R(2) coefficient for whole-body LSTM was higher in men (R(2) = 0.88, SEE = 1.9 kg) than in women (R(2) = 0.83, SEE = 1.5 kg). There was systematic bias with overestimation of whole-body FM and underestimation of whole-body LSTM by SMF-BIA. Proportional bias was noted for measurement of whole-body FM and LSTM in both men and women, but there was no proportional bias between the two methods for measurement of appendicular LSTM (r = 0.05, P = 0.428 and r = -0.10, P = 0.070 for men and women, respectively).
CONCLUSION: SMF-BIA is a good alternative for estimating the whole-body and appendicular FM and LSTM in a community-dwelling Japanese older population, although it overestimated FM and underestimated LSTM when validated against DXA."

Therefore, we aim to establish 2 prediction models for mothers and their offspring, which can predict the risk of adverse events occurred in pregnant women with congenital heart disease. Methods and Results A total of 318 pregnant women with congenital heart disease were included; 213 women were divided into the development cohort, and 105 women were divided into the validation cohort. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used for predictor selection. After validation, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop the model. Machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, AdaBoost, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, and multilayer perceptron) were used to further verify the predictive ability of the model. Forty-one (12.9%) women experienced adverse maternal events, and 93 (29.2%) neonates experienced adverse neonatal events. Seven high-risk factors were discovered in the maternal model, including New York Heart Association class, Eisenmenger syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction, sinus tachycardia, arterial blood oxygen saturation, and pregnancy duration. The machine learning-based algorithms showed that the maternal model had an accuracy of 0.76 to 0.86 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.74-0.87) in the development cohort, and 0.72 to 0.86 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.68-0.80) in the validation cohort. Three high-risk factors were discovered in the neonatal model, including Eisenmenger syndrome, preeclampsia, and arterial blood oxygen saturation. The machine learning-based algorithms showed that the neonatal model had an accuracy of 0.75 to 0.80 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.71-0.77) in the development cohort, and 0.72 to 0.79 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.69-0.76) in the validation cohort. Conclusions Two prenatal risk assessment models for both adverse maternal and neonatal events were established, which might assist clinicians in tailoring precise management and therapy in pregnant women with congenital heart disease."

The research on the impact and prediction of meteorology factors on influenza is increasing gradually, however, there is currently no evidence on whether its research results are affected by different periods. This study aims to provide limited evidence to reveal this issue.
METHODS: Daily data on influencing factors and influenza in Xiamen were divided into three parts: overall period (phase AB), non-COVID-19 epidemic period (phase A), and COVID-19 epidemic period (phase B). The association between influencing factors and influenza was analysed using generalized additive models (GAMs). The excess risk (ER) was used to represent the percentage change in influenza as the interquartile interval (IQR) of meteorology factors increases. The 7-day average daily influenza cases were predicted using the combination of bi-directional long short memory (Bi-LSTM) and random forest (RF) through multi-step rolling input of the daily multifactor values of the previous 7-day.
RESULTS: In periods A and AB, air temperature below 22 °C was a risk factor for influenza. However, in phase B, temperature showed a U-shaped effect on it. Relative humidity had a more significant cumulative effect on influenza in phase AB than in phase A (peak: accumulate 14d, AB: ER = 281.54, 95% CI = 245.47 ~ 321.37; A: ER = 120.48, 95% CI = 100.37 ~ 142.60). Compared to other age groups, children aged 4-12 were more affected by pressure, precipitation, sunshine, and day light, while those aged ≥ 13 were more affected by the accumulation of humidity over multiple days. The accuracy of predicting influenza was highest in phase A and lowest in phase B.
CONCLUSIONS: The varying degrees of intervention measures adopted during different phases led to significant differences in the impact of meteorology factors on influenza and in the influenza prediction. In association studies of respiratory infectious diseases, especially influenza, and environmental factors, it is advisable to exclude periods with more external interventions to reduce interference with environmental factors and influenza related research, or to refine the model to accommodate the alterations brought about by intervention measures. In addition, the RF-Bi-LSTM model has good predictive performance for influenza."

Current tools have poor to fair predictive performance for intermediate (90-d) and long-term (1-yr) mortality.
OBJECTIVE: To develop predictive algorithms for spinal metastatic disease at these time points and to provide patient-specific explanations of the predictions generated by these algorithms.
METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted at 2 large academic medical centers to identify patients undergoing initial operative management for spinal metastatic disease between January 2000 and December 2016. Five models (penalized logistic regression, random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, neural network, and support vector machine) were developed to predict 90-d and 1-yr mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 732 patients were identified with 90-d and 1-yr mortality rates of 181 (25.1%) and 385 (54.3%), respectively. The stochastic gradient boosting algorithm had the best performance for 90-d mortality and 1-yr mortality. On global variable importance assessment, albumin, primary tumor histology, and performance status were the 3 most important predictors of 90-d mortality. The final models were incorporated into an open access web application able to provide predictions as well as patient-specific explanations of the results generated by the algorithms. The application can be found at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/spinemetssurvival/.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative estimation of 90-d and 1-yr mortality was achieved with assessment of more flexible modeling techniques such as machine learning. Integration of these models into applications and patient-centered explanations of predictions represent opportunities for incorporation into healthcare systems as decision tools in the future."

OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop and validate 2 models, one to predict sustained, uncontrolled hypertension (≥2 blood pressure [BP] readings ≥140/90 mm Hg or ≥1 BP reading ≥180/120 mm Hg) and one to predict hypertensive crisis (≥1 BP reading ≥180/120 mm Hg) within 1 year of an index visit (outpatient or ambulatory encounter in which an uncontrolled BP reading was recorded).
METHODS: Data from 142,897 patients with uncontrolled hypertension within Atrium Health Greater Charlotte in 2018 were used. Electronic health record-based predictors were based on the 1-year period before a patient's index visit. The dataset was randomly split (80:20) into a training set and a validation set. In total, 4 machine learning frameworks were considered: L2-regularized logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, gradient boosting machines, and random forest. Model selection was performed with 10-fold cross-validation. The final models were assessed on discrimination (C-statistic), calibration (eg, integrated calibration index), and net benefit (with decision curve analysis). Additionally, internal-external cross-validation was performed at the county level to assess performance with new populations and summarized using random-effect meta-analyses.
RESULTS: In internal validation, the C-statistic and integrated calibration index were 0.72 (95% CI 0.71-0.72) and 0.015 (95% CI 0.012-0.020) for the sustained, uncontrolled hypertension model, and 0.81 (95% CI 0.79-0.82) and 0.009 (95% CI 0.007-0.011) for the hypertensive crisis model. The models had higher net benefit than the default policies (ie, treat-all and treat-none) across different decision thresholds. In internal-external cross-validation, the pooled performance was consistent with internal validation results; in particular, the pooled C-statistics were 0.70 (95% CI 0.69-0.71) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.78-0.81) for the sustained, uncontrolled hypertension model and hypertensive crisis model, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: An electronic health record-based model predicted hypertensive crisis reasonably well in internal and internal-external validations. The model can potentially be used to support population health surveillance and hypertension management. Further studies are needed to improve the ability to predict sustained, uncontrolled hypertension."

Nonetheless, there is a lack of effective prediction tools in clinical practice. By utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques, this study aims to develop a predictive model that can assist clinicians in identifying geriatric hip fracture patients at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: A total of 52 707 geriatric hip fracture patients treated with surgery from 90 hospitals were included in this study. The primary outcome was postoperative in-hospital mortality. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, with a ratio of 7:3. The majority of patients, assigned to the training cohort, were used to develop the AI models. The remaining patients, assigned to the validation cohort, were used to validate the models. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naïve bayesian (NB), neural network (NN), eXGBoosting machine (eXGBM), and random forest (RF), were employed for model development. A comprehensive scoring system, incorporating 10 evaluation metrics, was developed to assess the prediction performance, with higher scores indicating superior predictive capability. Based on the best machine learning-based model, an AI application was developed on the Internet. In addition, a comparative testing of prediction performance between doctors and the AI application.
FINDINGS: The eXGBM model exhibited the best prediction performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.908 (95% CI: 0.881-0.932), as well as the highest accuracy (0.820), precision (0.817), specificity (0.814), and F1 score (0.822), and the lowest Brier score (0.120) and log loss (0.374). Additionally, the model showed favorable calibration, with a slope of 0.999 and an intercept of 0.028. According to the scoring system incorporating 10 evaluation metrics, the eXGBM model achieved the highest score (56), followed by the RF model (48) and NN model (41). The LR, DT, and NB models had total scores of 27, 30, and 13, respectively. The AI application has been deployed online at https://in-hospitaldeathinhipfracture-l9vhqo3l55fy8dkdvuskvu.streamlit.app/ , based on the eXGBM model. The comparative testing revealed that the AI application's predictive capabilities significantly outperformed those of the doctors in terms of AUC values (0.908 vs. 0.682, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The eXGBM model demonstrates promising predictive performance in assessing the risk of postoperative in-hospital mortality among geriatric hip fracture patients. The developed AI model serves as a valuable tool to enhance clinical decision-making."

Using in-hospital data available within the first 24 hours of admission, we aimed to develop more accurate models of risk prediction using both logistic regression (LR) and machine learning (ML) techniques, with a combination of demographic, physiologic, and biochemical information.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Patient-level data were extracted from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database for patients who had experienced a cardiac arrest within 24 hours prior to admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) during the period January 2006 to December 2016. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The models were trained and tested on a dataset (split 90:10) including age, lowest and highest physiologic variables during the first 24 hours, and key past medical history. LR and 5 ML approaches (gradient boosting machine [GBM], support vector classifier [SVC], random forest [RF], artificial neural network [ANN], and an ensemble) were compared to the APACHE III and Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death (ANZROD) predictions. In all, 39,566 patients from 186 ICUs were analysed. Mean (±SD) age was 61 ± 17 years; 65% were male. Overall in-hospital mortality was 45.5%. Models were evaluated in the test set. The APACHE III and ANZROD scores demonstrated good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.80 [95% CI 0.79-0.82] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.8-0.82], respectively) and modest calibration (Brier score 0.19 for both), which was slightly improved by LR (AUROC = 0.82 [95% CI 0.81-0.83], DeLong test, p < 0.001). Discrimination was significantly improved using ML models (ensemble and GBM AUROCs = 0.87 [95% CI 0.86-0.88], DeLong test, p < 0.001), with an improvement in performance (Brier score reduction of 22%). Explainability models were created to assist in identifying the physiologic features that most contributed to an individual patient's survival. Key limitations include the absence of pre-hospital data and absence of external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: ML approaches significantly enhance predictive discrimination for mortality following cardiac arrest compared to existing illness severity scores and LR, without the use of pre-hospital data. The discriminative ability of these ML models requires validation in external cohorts to establish generalisability."

Epub 2020 Oct 12.,Thompson CL,Drug Alcohol Depend,2021,2020/10/28,,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108344,"BACKGROUND: Prescription tranquilizer misuse is a risky behavior associated with fatal drug poisonings. Although various predictors have been examined, there is no published prediction model for tranquilizer misuse. This study develops and internally validates a tranquilizer misuse prediction model based primarily on drug histories of participants in a national cross-sectional survey. Predictors also include psychiatric, behavioral and demographic variables.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 471,097 individuals aged 14-to-29-years in the United States, as sampled by the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, 2004-2018, an annual cross-sectional survey. We encoded 21 predictors with known or likely onset prior to tranquilizer misuse initiation, (e.g., early onset of cannabis use). With this dataset, we trained a neural network and regularized logistic regression model. While the assessment for tranquilizer misuse changed slightly in 2015, by pooling all years of survey data, predictions are robust to this source of variation.
RESULTS: 1.44% of the pooled sample, 2004-2018, recently initiated tranquilizer misuse (unweighted estimate). On held-out test data (n = 43,714), logistic regression and the neural network performed equally well, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ∼0.83 on the primary model, containing 12 variables known to occur before tranquilizer misuse.
CONCLUSION: Built for case prediction rather than case detection, this model restricted predictors to those with known timing prior to initiation of tranquilizer misuse. Yet its performance supersedes commonly accepted criteria for clinical prediction models (AUC > 0.80). Future work should incorporate survey analysis weights into the prediction model to minimize possible bias."

This holds in particular for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a breast cancer subtype for which currently no prognostic biomarkers are established. Although different methods to assess tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been published, it remains unclear which method (marker, region) yields the most optimal prognostic information. In addition, to date, no objective TILs assessment methods are available. For this proof of concept study, a subset of our previously described TNBC cohort (n = 94) was stained for CD3, CD8 and FOXP3 using multiplex immunohistochemistry and subsequently imaged by a multispectral imaging system. Advanced whole-slide image analysis algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) were used to register unmixed multispectral images and corresponding H&E sections, to segment the different tissue compartments (tumour, stroma) and to detect all individual positive lymphocytes. Densities of positive lymphocytes were analysed in different regions within the tumour and its neighbouring environment and correlated to relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). We found that for all TILs markers the presence of a high density of positive cells correlated with an improved survival. None of the TILs markers was superior to the others. The results of TILs assessment in the various regions did not show marked differences between each other. The negative correlation between TILs and survival in our cohort are in line with previous studies. Our results provide directions for optimizing TILs assessment methodology."

Therefore, ALDLT must be responsibly performed in the perspective of a positive harm-to-benefit ratio. This study aimed to develop a risk prediction model for early (3 months) graft failure (EGF) following ALDLT. Donor and recipient factors associated with EGF in ALDLT were studied using data from the European Liver Transplant Registry. An artificial neural network classification algorithm was trained on a set of 2073 ALDLTs, validated using cross-validation, tested on an independent random-split sample (n=518), and externally validated on United Network for Organ Sharing Standard Transplant Analysis and Research data. Model performance was assessed using the AUC, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Graft type, graft weight, level of hospitalization, and the severity of liver disease were associated with EGF. The model ( http://ldlt.shinyapps.io/eltr_app ) presented AUC values at cross-validation, in the independent test set, and at external validation of 0.69, 0.70, and 0.68, respectively. Model calibration was fair. The decision curve analysis indicated a positive net benefit of the model, with an estimated net reduction of 5-15 EGF per 100 ALDLTs. Estimated risks>40% and<5% had a specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.99 in predicting and excluding EGF, respectively. The model also stratified long-term graft survival ( p <0.001), which ranged from 87% in the low-risk group to 60% in the high-risk group. In conclusion, based on a panel of donor and recipient variables, an artificial neural network can contribute to decision-making in ALDLT by predicting EGF risk."

Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions a priori, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems."

This study developed and validated a machine learning model to predict POST. A total number of 834 patients who underwent general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were included in this study. Data from a cohort of 685 patients was used for model development and validation, while a cohort of 149 patients served for external validation. The prediction performance of random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models was compared using comprehensive performance metrics. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods elucidated the best-performing model. POST incidences across training, validation, and testing cohorts were 41.7%, 38.4%, and 36.2%, respectively. Five predictors were age, sex, endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal tube insertion depth, and the time interval between extubation and the first drinking of water after extubation. After incorporating these variables, the NN model demonstrated superior generalization capabilities in predicting POST when compared to the XGBoost and RF models in external validation, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.89) and a precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). The model also showed good calibration and clinical usage values. The NN model outperforms the XGBoost and RF models in predicting POST, with potential applications in the healthcare industry for reducing the incidence of this common postoperative complication."

General Machine learning literature provides evidence in favor of some classifier families (random forest, support vector machine, gradient boosting) in terms of classification performance. The purpose of this study is to compare such classifiers specifically for (chemo)radiotherapy datasets and to estimate their average discriminative performance for radiation treatment outcome prediction.
METHODS: We collected 12 datasets (3496 patients) from prior studies on post-(chemo)radiotherapy toxicity, survival, or tumor control with clinical, dosimetric, or blood biomarker features from multiple institutions and for different tumor sites, that is, (non-)small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and meningioma. Six common classification algorithms with built-in feature selection (decision tree, random forest, neural network, support vector machine, elastic net logistic regression, LogitBoost) were applied on each dataset using the popular open-source R package caret. The R code and documentation for the analysis are available online (https://github.com/timodeist/classifier_selection_code). All classifiers were run on each dataset in a 100-repeated nested fivefold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning. Performance metrics (AUC, calibration slope and intercept, accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and Brier score) were computed. We ranked classifiers by AUC to determine which classifier is likely to also perform well in future studies. We simulated the benefit for potential investigators to select a certain classifier for a new dataset based on our study (pre-selection based on other datasets) or estimating the best classifier for a dataset (set-specific selection based on information from the new dataset) compared with uninformed classifier selection (random selection).
RESULTS: Random forest (best in 6/12 datasets) and elastic net logistic regression (best in 4/12 datasets) showed the overall best discrimination, but there was no single best classifier across datasets. Both classifiers had a median AUC rank of 2. Preselection and set-specific selection yielded a significant average AUC improvement of 0.02 and 0.02 over random selection with an average AUC rank improvement of 0.42 and 0.66, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Random forest and elastic net logistic regression yield higher discriminative performance in (chemo)radiotherapy outcome and toxicity prediction than other studied classifiers. Thus, one of these two classifiers should be the first choice for investigators when building classification models or to benchmark one's own modeling results against. Our results also show that an informed preselection of classifiers based on existing datasets can improve discrimination over random selection."

This makes it possible to anticipate the planning and organization of the health system, as well as possible restrictive or preventive measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this need for prediction has been crucial. This paper attempts to characterize the alternative models that were applied in the first wave of this pandemic context, trying to shed light that could help to understand them for future practical applications. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in standardized bibliographic repertoires, using keywords and Boolean operators to refine the findings, and selecting articles according to the main PRISMA 2020 statement recommendations. Results: After identifying models used throughout the first wave of this pandemic (between March and June 2020), we begin by examining standard data-driven epidemiological models, including studies applying models such as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered), SQUIDER, SEIR, time-dependent SIR, and other alternatives. For data-driven methods, we identify experiences using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), evolutionary genetic programming machine learning, short-term memory (LSTM), and global epidemic and mobility models. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to intensive and evolving use of alternative infectious disease prediction models. At this point it is not easy to decide which prediction method is the best in a generic way. Moreover, although models such as the LSTM emerge as remarkably versatile and useful, the practical applicability of the alternatives depends on the specific context of the underlying variable and on the information of the target to be prioritized. In addition, the robustness of the assessment is conditioned by heterogeneity in the quality of information sources and differences in the characteristics of disease control interventions. Further comprehensive comparison of the performance of models in comparable situations, assessing their predictive validity, is needed. This will help determine the most reliable and practical methods for application in future outbreaks and eventual pandemics."

The early detection of HAI is crucial for curbing its transmission in hospital settings.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate factors related to HAI, develop predictive models, and subsequently compare them to identify the best performing machine learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of HAI.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in 2022 and included 111 HAI and 73,748 non-HAI patients from the 2011-2012 and 2019-2020 influenza seasons. General characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory and chest X-ray results, and room information within the electronic medical record were analysed. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques were used to construct the predictive models. Employing randomized allocation, 80% of the dataset constituted the training set, and the remaining 20% comprised the test set. The performance of the developed models was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the count of false negatives (FN), and the determination of feature importance.
RESULTS: Patients with HAI demonstrated notable differences in general characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory findings, chest X-ray result, and room status compared to non-HAI patients. Among the developed models, the RF model demonstrated the best performance taking into account both the AUC (83.3%) and the occurrence of FN (four). The most influential factors for prediction were staying in double rooms, followed by vital signs and laboratory results.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the characteristics of patients with HAI and emphasized the role of ventilation in reducing influenza incidence. These findings can aid hospitals in devising infection prevention strategies, and the application of machine learning-based predictive models especially RF can enable early intervention to mitigate the spread of influenza in healthcare settings."

We hypothesised that a novel artificial intelligence approach could better assess multiple and higher-dimension interactions of comorbidities, and define clusters of β-blocker efficacy in patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: Neural network-based variational autoencoders and hierarchical clustering were applied to pooled individual patient data from nine double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of β blockers. All-cause mortality during median 1·3 years of follow-up was assessed by intention to treat, stratified by electrocardiographic heart rhythm. The number of clusters and dimensions was determined objectively, with results validated using a leave-one-trial-out approach. This study was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00832442) and the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010012).
FINDINGS: 15 659 patients with heart failure and LVEF of less than 50% were included, with median age 65 years (IQR 56-72) and LVEF 27% (IQR 21-33). 3708 (24%) patients were women. In sinus rhythm (n=12 822), most clusters demonstrated a consistent overall mortality benefit from β blockers, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0·54 to 0·74. One cluster in sinus rhythm of older patients with less severe symptoms showed no significant efficacy (OR 0·86, 95% CI 0·67-1·10; p=0·22). In atrial fibrillation (n=2837), four of five clusters were consistent with the overall neutral effect of β blockers versus placebo (OR 0·92, 0·77-1·10; p=0·37). One cluster of younger atrial fibrillation patients at lower mortality risk but similar LVEF to average had a statistically significant reduction in mortality with β blockers (OR 0·57, 0·35-0·93; p=0·023). The robustness and consistency of clustering was confirmed for all models (p<0·0001 vs random), and cluster membership was externally validated across the nine independent trials.
INTERPRETATION: An artificial intelligence-based clustering approach was able to distinguish prognostic response from β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF. This included patients in sinus rhythm with suboptimal efficacy, as well as a cluster of patients with atrial fibrillation where β blockers did reduce mortality.

The predictive ability of the models was tested by fivefold cross-validation; giving q(2) = 0.77-0.92 for regression models and accuracy 83-88% for classification models. Twenty synthesized samples of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids with predictive value of activity level of antimicrobial potential were evaluated. For all asymmetric 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids, only compounds containing at least one radical with alkyl chain length of 12 carbon atoms showed high antibacterial activity. However, the activity of symmetric 1,3-dialkylimidazolium salts was found to have opposite relationship with the length of aliphatic radical being maximum for compounds based on 1,3-dioctylimidazolium cation. The obtained experimental results suggested that the application of classification QSAR models is more accurate for the prediction of activity of new imidazolium-based ILs as potential antibacterials."

Although many aspects of a child's life, personality, and symptoms have been flagged as indicators, there is currently no model created to screen the general population for the risk of developing mental health problems. Additionally, the advent of machine learning techniques represents an exciting way to potentially improve upon the standard prediction modelling technique, logistic regression. Therefore, we aimed to I.) develop a model that can predict mental health problems in mid-adolescence II.) investigate if machine learning techniques (random forest, support vector machines, neural network, and XGBoost) will outperform logistic regression.
METHODS: In 7,638 twins from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden we used 474 predictors derived from parental report and register data. The outcome, mental health problems, was determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Model performance was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Although model performance varied somewhat, the confidence interval overlapped for each model indicating non-significant superiority for the random forest model (AUC = 0.739, 95% CI 0.708-0.769), followed closely by support vector machines (AUC = 0.735, 95% CI 0.707-0.764).
CONCLUSION: Ultimately, our top performing model would not be suitable for clinical use, however it lays important groundwork for future models seeking to predict general mental health outcomes. Future studies should make use of parent-rated assessments when possible. Additionally, it may not be necessary for similar studies to forgo logistic regression in favor of other more complex methods."

Epub 2024 Jan 24.,Teoh YX,Clin Biomech (Bristol),2024,2024/02/13,,,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2024.106188,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of evidence-based rehabilitation strategies that address biomechanical deficits, the persistence of recurrent ankle problems in 70% of patients with acute ankle sprains highlights the unresolved nature of this issue. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains.
METHODS: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used.
FINDINGS: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data. Support vector machine was the most used supervised learning algorithm (18.64%), while artificial neural network demonstrated the highest accuracy in eight studies.
INTERPRETATIONS: The potential for remote patient monitoring is evident with the adoption of field-based devices. Nevertheless, AI-based sensors are underutilized in detecting ankle motions at risk of sprain. We identify three key challenges: sensor designs, the controllability of AI models, and the integration of AI-sensor models, providing valuable insights for future research."

DATA SOURCE: The Centres for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Limited Data Set files containing the five per cent samples for 2014 and 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: The data analysed contains de-identified administrative claims information at the beneficiary level, including diagnoses, procedures and demographics for 2.7 million beneficiaries.
SETTING: US national sample of Medicare beneficiaries.
STUDY DESIGN: Eleven different models were used to predict 15-month mortality risk: logistic regression (using both stepwise and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) selection of variables as well as models using an age gender baseline, Charlson scores, Charlson conditions, Elixhauser conditions and all variables), naïve Bayes, decision tree with adaptive boosting, neural network and support vector machines (SVMs) validated by simple cross validation. Updated Charlson score weights were generated from the predictive model using only Charlson conditions.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: C-statistic.
RESULTS: The c-statistics was 0.696 for the naïve Bayes model and 0.762 for the decision tree model. For models that used the Charlson score or the Charlson variables the c-statistic was 0.713 and 0.726, respectively, similar to the model using Elixhauser conditions of 0.734. The c-statistic for the SVM model was 0.788 while the four models that performed the best were the logistic regression using all variables, logistic regression after selection of variables by the LASSO method, the logistic regression using a stepwise selection of variables and the neural network with c-statistics of 0.798, 0.798, 0.797 and 0.795, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved means for identifying individuals in the last 15 months of life is needed to improve the patient experience of care and reducing the per capita cost of healthcare. This study developed and validated a predictive model for 15-month mortality with higher generalisability than previous administrative claims-based studies."

This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical prediction model to predict the risk of lung metastasis among osteosarcoma patients based on machine learning (ML) algorithms.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected osteosarcoma patients from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database and from four hospitals in China. Six ML algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were applied to build predictive models for predicting lung metastasis using patient's demographics, clinical characteristics, and therapeutic variables from the SEER database. The model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation to calculate the mean area under the curve (AUC) and the model was externally validated using the Chinese multicenter osteosarcoma data. Relative importance ranking of predictors was plotted to understand the importance of each predictor in different ML algorithms. The correlation heat map of predictors was plotted to understand the correlation of each predictor, selecting the 10-fold cross-validation with the highest AUC value in the external validation ROC curve to build a web calculator.
RESULTS: Of all enrolled patients from the SEER database, 17.73% (194/1094) developed lung metastasis. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that sex, N stage, T stage, surgery, and bone metastasis were all independent risk factors for lung metastasis. In predicting lung metastasis, the mean AUCs of the six ML algorithms ranged from 0.711 to 0.738 in internal validation and 0.697 to 0.729 in external validation. Among the six ML algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model had the highest AUC value with an average internal AUC of 0.738 and an external AUC of 0.729. The best performing ML algorithm model was used to build a web calculator to facilitate clinicians to calculate the risk of lung metastasis for each patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The XGBoost model may have the best prediction effect and the online calculator based on this model can help doctors to determine the lung metastasis risk of osteosarcoma patients and help to make individualized medical strategies."

METHODS: A GLCM was used to extract the texture features of 155 sonograms of thyroid nodules (76 benign and 79 malignant). The GLCM features included energy, contrast, correlation, sum of squares, inverse difference moment, sum average, sum variance, sum entropy, entropy, difference variance, difference entropy, information measures of correlation, and maximal correlation coefficient. The texture features extracted by the GLCM were used to build 6 different statistical models, including support vector machine, random tree, random forest, boost, logistic, and artificial neural network models. The models' performances were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation combining a receiver operating characteristic curve, indices of accuracy, true-positive rate, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, F-measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. External validation was used to examine the stability of the model that showed the best performance.
RESULTS: The logistic model showed the best performance, according to 10-fold cross-validation, among the 6 models, with the highest area under the curve (0.84), accuracy (78.5%), true-positive rate (0.785), sensitivity (0.789), specificity (0.785), precision (0.789), recall (0.785), and F-measure (0.784), as well as the lowest false-positive rate (0.215). The external validation results showed that the logistic model was stable.
CONCLUSIONS: Gray-level co-occurrence matrix texture features extracted from sonograms of thyroid nodules coupled with a logistic model are useful for differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid nodules."

Epub 2015 Apr 27.,Stylianou N,Burns,2015,2015/05/02,,,10.1016/j.burns.2015.03.016,"INTRODUCTION: Predicting mortality from burn injury has traditionally employed logistic regression models. Alternative machine learning methods have been introduced in some areas of clinical prediction as the necessary software and computational facilities have become accessible. Here we compare logistic regression and machine learning predictions of mortality from burn.
METHODS: An established logistic mortality model was compared to machine learning methods (artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forests and naïve Bayes) using a population-based (England & Wales) case-cohort registry. Predictive evaluation used: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity; specificity; positive predictive value and Youden's index.
RESULTS: All methods had comparable discriminatory abilities, similar sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values. Although some machine learning methods performed marginally better than logistic regression the differences were seldom statistically significant and clinically insubstantial. Random forests were marginally better for high positive predictive value and reasonable sensitivity. Neural networks yielded slightly better prediction overall. Logistic regression gives an optimal mix of performance and interpretability.
DISCUSSION: The established logistic regression model of burn mortality performs well against more complex alternatives. Clinical prediction with a small set of strong, stable, independent predictors is unlikely to gain much from machine learning outside specialist research contexts."

It is proved to be a difficult task to eliminate HFRS completely because of the diverse animal reservoirs and effects of global warming. Reliable forecasting is useful for the prevention and control of HFRS.
METHODS: Two hybrid models, one composed of nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) the other composed of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and ARIMA were constructed to predict the incidence of HFRS in the future one year. Performances of the two hybrid models were compared with ARIMA model.
RESULTS: The ARIMA, ARIMA-NARNN ARIMA-GRNN model fitted and predicted the seasonal fluctuation well. Among the three models, the mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of ARIMA-NARNN hybrid model was the lowest both in modeling stage and forecasting stage. As for the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model, the MSE, MAE and MAPE of modeling performance and the MSE and MAE of forecasting performance were less than the ARIMA model, but the MAPE of forecasting performance did not improve.
CONCLUSION: Developing and applying the ARIMA-NARNN hybrid model is an effective method to make us better understand the epidemic characteristics of HFRS and could be helpful to the prevention and control of HFRS."
31775813,The external validation of a difficulty scoring system for predicting the risk of intraoperative complications during laparoscopic liver resection,"Ivanecz A, Plahuta I, Magdalenić T, Mencinger M, Peruš I, Potrč S, Krebs B.",BMC Surg. 2019 Nov 27;19(1):179. doi: 10.1186/s12893-019-0645-y.,Ivanecz A,BMC Surg,2019,2019/11/29,PMC6882247,,10.1186/s12893-019-0645-y,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to externally validate and upgrade the recent difficulty scoring system (DSS) proposed by Halls et al. to predict intraoperative complications (IOC) during laparoscopic liver resection (LLR).
METHODS: The DSS was validated in a cohort of 128 consecutive patients undergoing pure LLRs between 2008 and 2019 at a single tertiary referral center. The validated DSS includes four difficulty levels based on five risk factors (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, previous open liver resection, lesion type, lesion size and classification of resection). As established by the validated DSS, IOC was defined as excessive blood loss (> 775 mL), conversion to an open approach and unintentional damage to surrounding structures. Additionally, intra- and postoperative outcomes were compared according to the difficulty levels with usual statistic methods. The same five risk factors were used for validation done by linear and advanced nonlinear (artificial neural network) models. The study was supported by mathematical computations to obtain a mean risk curve predicting the probability of IOC for every difficulty score.
RESULTS: The difficulty level of LLR was rated as low, moderate, high and extremely high in 36 (28.1%), 63 (49.2%), 27 (21.1%) and 2 (1.6%) patients, respectively. IOC was present in 23 (17.9%) patients. Blood loss of >775 mL occurred in 8 (6.2%) patients. Conversion to open approach was required in 18 (14.0%) patients. No patients suffered from unintentional damage to surrounding structures. Rates of IOC (0, 9.5, 55.5 and 100%) increased gradually with statistically significant value among difficulty levels (P < 0.001). The relations between the difficulty level, need for transfusion, operative time, hepatic pedicle clamping, and major postoperative morbidity were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Linear and nonlinear validation models showed a strong correlation (correlation coefficients 0.914 and 0.948, respectively) with the validated DSS. The Weibull cumulative distribution function was used for predicting the mean risk probability curve of IOC.
CONCLUSION: This external validation proved this DSS based on patient's, tumor and surgical factors enables us to estimate the risk of intra- and postoperative complications. A surgeon should be aware of an increased risk of complications before starting with more complex procedures."

METHODS: We analyzed data from an observational cohort study of 560 older adults (≥ 70 years) without dementia undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery. Post-operative delirium was determined by the Confusion Assessment Method supplemented by a medical chart review (N = 134, 24%). Five machine learning algorithms and a standard stepwise logistic regression model were developed in a training sample (80% of participants) and evaluated in the remaining hold-out testing sample. We evaluated three overlapping feature sets, restricted to variables that are readily available or minimally burdensome to collect in clinical settings, including interview and medical record data. A large feature set included 71 potential predictors. A smaller set of 18 features was selected by an expert panel using a consensus process, and this smaller feature set was considered with and without a measure of pre-operative mental status.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was higher in the large feature set conditions (range of AUC, 0.62-0.71 across algorithms) versus the selected feature set conditions (AUC range, 0.53-0.57). The restricted feature set with mental status had intermediate AUC values (range, 0.53-0.68). In the full feature set condition, algorithms such as gradient boosting, cross-validated logistic regression, and neural network (AUC = 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.83) were comparable with a model developed using traditional stepwise logistic regression (AUC = 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.82). Calibration for all models and feature sets was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed machine learning prediction models for post-operative delirium that performed better than chance and are comparable with traditional stepwise logistic regression. Delirium proved to be a phenotype that was difficult to predict with appreciable accuracy."

Epub 2014 Aug 22.,Su BH,Pediatr Neonatol,2015,2014/08/27,,,10.1016/j.pedneo.2014.05.002,"BACKGROUND: This study compared the current trend in survival rates and morbidity for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in five Medical Training Centers of Prematurity for the Premature Baby Foundation of Taiwan (PBFT), with the outcomes from the USA, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network (NICHD NRN), the Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN), and the Neonatal Research Network of Japan (NRNJ).
METHODS: The survival rates of VLBW infants according to gestational age (GA) and major morbidities were compared between networks (Taiwan, USA, Canada, and Japan). Taiwanese data for VLBW infants of GA ≤28 weeks between 2007 and 2012 were obtained from the ""PBFT Annual Conferences of Premature Care"" reports defining survival rate as neonates that survived to the time of discharge. Major morbidities included severe neurological injury (Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and patent ductus arteriosus.
RESULTS: The survival rates of VLBW infants of GA ≤28 weeks from the PBFT (Taiwan), NICHD NRN (USA), CNN (Canada), and NRNJ (Japan) were 77% (1323/1718), 72% (6859/9575), 82% (2353/2872), and 89% (4489/5069), respectively. The annual survival rates in Taiwan from 2007 to 2012 were 72%, 76%, 76%, 74%, 77%, and 78%, respectively. When GA from ≤23 weeks to 28 weeks was assessed in Taiwan, the survival rates of VLBW infants according to each week were 22%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 88%, and 92%, respectively. The survival rate, especially at lower GAs, was highest in the NRNJ (Japan). The major difference between Taiwan and Japan was attributed to the lower survival rates at lower GA (≤26 weeks) in Taiwan. Japan had the lowest rates of major morbidities among the four countries.
CONCLUSION: The survival rate of VLBW infants has improved over the past 6 years in Taiwan. It is higher than the USA, but lower than Canada and Japan. However, the results from Taiwan are from five Medical Training Centers for the PBFT rather than from a population-based study. It is crucial to have a nationwide neonatal research network to develop new practical approaches for VLBW infants in Taiwan."

METHODS: Patients with intracranial aneurysms diagnosed by computed tomography angiography and confirmed by invasive cerebral angiograph or clipping surgery were included. The prediction models were developed based on clinical, aneurysm morphological, and hemodynamic parameters by conventional LR and ML methods.
RESULTS: The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts were composed of 807 patients, 200 patients, and 108 patients, respectively. The area under curves (AUCs) of conventional LR models 1 (clinical), 2 (clinical and aneurysm morphological), and 3 (clinical, aneurysm morphological and hemodynamic characteristics) were 0.608, 0.765, and 0.886, respectively (all p < 0.05). The AUCs of ML models using random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) were 0.871, 0.851, and 0.863, respectively. There were no difference among AUCs of conventional LR, RF, and SVM (all p > 0.05/6), while the AUC of MLP was lower than that of conventional LR (p = 0.0055).
CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic parameters play an important role in the prediction performance of the models. ML methods cannot outperform conventional LR in prediction models for rupture status of UIAs integrating clinical, aneurysm morphological, and hemodynamic parameters.
KEY POINTS: • The addition of hemodynamic parameters can improve prediction performance for rupture status of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. • Machine learning algorithms cannot outperform conventional logistic regression in prediction models for rupture status integrating clinical, aneurysm morphological, and hemodynamic parameters. • Models integrating clinical, aneurysm morphological, and hemodynamic parameters may help choose the optimal management."

Epub 2019 Jun 4.,Cueto-López N,Comput Methods Programs Biomed,2019,2019/07/20,,,10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.06.001,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Risk prediction models aim at identifying people at higher risk of developing a target disease. Feature selection is particularly important to improve the prediction model performance avoiding overfitting and to identify the leading cancer risk (and protective) factors. Assessing the stability of feature selection/ranking algorithms becomes an important issue when the aim is to analyze the features with more prediction power.
METHODS: This work is focused on colorectal cancer, assessing several feature ranking algorithms in terms of performance for a set of risk prediction models (Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors and Boosted Trees). Additionally, their robustness is evaluated following a conventional approach with scalar stability metrics and a visual approach proposed in this work to study both similarity among feature ranking techniques as well as their individual stability. A comparative analysis is carried out between the most relevant features found out in this study and features provided by the experts according to the state-of-the-art knowledge.
RESULTS: The two best performance results in terms of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are achieved with a SVM classifier using the top-41 features selected by the SVM wrapper approach (AUC=0.693) and Logistic Regression with the top-40 features selected by the Pearson (AUC=0.689). Experiments showed that performing feature selection contributes to classification performance with a 3.9% and 1.9% improvement in AUC for the SVM and Logistic Regression classifier, respectively, with respect to the results using the full feature set. The visual approach proposed in this work allows to see that the Neural Network-based wrapper ranking is the most unstable while the Random Forest is the most stable.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that stability and model performance should be studied jointly as Random Forest turned out to be the most stable algorithm but outperformed by others in terms of model performance while SVM wrapper and the Pearson correlation coefficient are moderately stable while achieving good model performance."

We collected retrospective data from VLBW infants, dividing them into two cohorts: one for model development and internal validation (Cohort 1, 2016-2021), and another for external validation (Cohort 2, 2022). Primary outcomes included early mortality, severe IVH, and early poor outcomes (a combination of both). Data preprocessing involved 23 variables, with the top four predictors identified as gestational age, birth body weight, 5-min Apgar score, and endotracheal tube ventilation. Six machine learning algorithms were employed. Among 7471 infants analyzed, the selected predictors consistently performed well across all outcomes. Logistic regression and neural network models showed the highest predictive performance (AUC 0.81-0.90 in both internal and external validation) and were well-calibrated, confirmed by calibration plots and the lowest two mean Brier scores (0.0685 and 0.0691). We developed a robust machine learning-based outcome predictor using only four accessible variables, offering valuable prognostic information for parents and aiding healthcare providers in decision-making."

The elderly are a high-risk group and are highly vulnerable to COVID-19. Assistive software chatbots can enhance the mental health status of the elderly by providing support and companionship. The objective of this study was to validate a Thai artificial chatmate for the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic and floods.
METHODS: Chatbot design includes the establishment of a dataset and emotional word vectors in which data consisting of emotional sentences were converted into the word vector form using a pre-trained word2vec model. A word vector was then input into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained until the model converges using sentence embedding and similarity word segmentation. Sentence vectors were generated by averaging each word vector using an averaged vector method. For approximate similarity matching, the Annoy library was used to create the indices in tree sorting. Data were collected from 22 elderly and assessed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ).
RESULTS: The study revealed that 72.73% of the respondents found the chatbot easy to learn and use, 63.64% of the respondents found the chatbot can autonomously determine the next course of action, and 59.09% of the respondents believed that troubleshooting guidelines were provided for overcoming errors. The accuracy of the chatbot providing a reasonable response is 56.20±13.99%.
CONCLUSIONS: Most users were satisfied with the chatbot system. The proposed chatbot provided considerable essential insights into the development of assistance systems for the elderly during the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and during the period of national disasters.

We aimed to assess the cardiovascular risk profile and coronary angiography (CA) findings of cancer patients and compare them to those of patients without cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis was conducted on randomly enrolled cancer and non-cancer patients from a high-volume cardio-oncology center and a tertiary cardiology center, respectively, who underwent CA from April 2008 to June 2018. Baseline demographics, laboratory findings, cancer status and treatment, and current and prior CA findings were collected by chart review. Coronary artery disease (CAD) burden was assessed with machine-learning (neural-network) guided propensity-score adjusted multivariable regression, controlling for known CAD confounders.
RESULTS: Of the 480 enrolled patients, a total of 240 (50%) had cancer. Fewer cancer vs non-cancer patients had clinically significant lesions on the left anterior descending artery (25.00% vs 39.17%, respectively; P<.01) and left circumflex artery (15.83% vs 30.00%, respectively; P<.001). Left main and right coronary artery disease prevalence was similar. Subjects with cancer were less likely to have multivessel CAD (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.98; P=.04) and significant left circumflex artery lesions (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.85; P=.01), independent of known CAD confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer have a lower burden of angiographically detected coronary atherosclerosis. Cancer patients are more likely than non-cancer patients to undergo CA for reasons other than suspicion of CAD. Further studies should prospectively analyze the impact of cancer on the development of CAD."

Epub 2017 Sep 21.,Fenlon C,J Dairy Sci,2017,2017/09/25,,,10.3168/jds.2017-12931,"The aim of this study was to build and compare predictive models of calving difficulty in dairy heifers and cows for the purpose of decision support and simulation modeling. Models to predict 3 levels of calving difficulty (unassisted, slight assistance, and considerable or veterinary assistance) were created using 4 machine learning techniques: multinomial regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The data used were sourced from 2,076 calving records in 10 Irish dairy herds. In total, 19.9 and 5.9% of calving events required slight assistance and considerable or veterinary assistance, respectively. Variables related to parity, genetics, BCS, breed, previous calving, and reproductive events and the calf were included in the analysis. Based on a stepwise regression modeling process, the variables included in the models were the dam's direct and maternal calving difficulty predicted transmitting abilities (PTA), BCS at calving, parity; calving assistance or difficulty at the previous calving; proportion of Holstein breed; sire breed; sire direct calving difficulty PTA; twinning; and 2-way interactions between calving BCS and previous calving difficulty and the direct calving difficulty PTA of dam and sire. The models were built using bootstrapping procedures on 70% of the data set. The held-back 30% of the data was used to evaluate the predictive performance of the models in terms of discrimination and calibration. The decision tree and random forest models omitted the effect of twinning and included only subsets of sire breeds. Only multinomial regression and neural networks explicitly included the modeled interactions. Calving BCS, calving difficulty PTA, and previous calving assistance ranked as highly important variables for all 4 models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ranging from 0.64 to 0.79) indicates that all of the models had good overall discriminatory power. The neural network and multinomial regression models performed best, correctly classifying 75% of calving cases and showing superior calibration, with an average error in predicted probability of 3.7 and 4.5%, respectively. The neural network and multinomial regression models developed are both suitable for use in decision-support and simulation modeling."

Screening for gastric cancer greatly relies on endoscopy and pathology biopsy, which are invasive and pose financial burdens. Thus, the prevention of the disease by modifying lifestyle-related behaviors and dietary habits or even the prevention of risk factor formation is of great importance. This study aimed to construct an inexpensive, non-invasive, fast, and high-precision diagnostic model using six machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify patients at high or low risk of developing gastric cancer by analyzing individual lifestyle factors.
METHODS: This retrospective study used the data of 2029 individuals from the gastric cancer database of Ayatollah Taleghani Hospital in Abadan City, Iran. The data were randomly separated into training and test sets (ratio 0.7:0.3). Six  ML methods, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) (linear kernel), SVM (RBF kernel), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) (K = 1, 3, 7, 9), random forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were trained to construct prognostic models before and after performing the relief feature selection method. Finally, to evaluate the models' performance, the metrics derived from the confusion matrix were calculated via a test split and cross-validation.
RESULTS: This study found 11 important influence factors for the risk of gastric cancer, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, high salt intake, and chronic atrophic gastritis, among other factors. Comparisons indicated that the XGBoost had the best performance for the risk prediction of gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that based on simple baseline patient data, the ML techniques have the potential to start the prescreening of gastric cancer and identify high-risk individuals who should proceed with invasive examinations. Our model could also considerably lessen the number of cases that need endoscopic surveillance. Future studies are required to validate the efficacy of the models in a larger and multicenter population."

Data were retrieved from 1709 pregnant women who participated in the multicenter prospective cohort study 'Cuido mi embarazo'. A machine-learning-driven method was used to select the best predictive variables for GDM risk: age, family history of type 2 diabetes, previous diagnosis of hypertension, pregestational body mass index, gestational week, parity, birth weight of last child, and random capillary glucose. An artificial neural network approach was then used to build the model, which achieved a high level of accuracy (70.3%) and sensitivity (83.3%) for identifying women at high risk of developing GDM. This AI-based model will be applied throughout Mexico to improve the timing and quality of GDM interventions. Given the ease of obtaining the model variables, this model is expected to be clinically strategic, allowing prioritization of preventative treatment and promising a paradigm shift in prevention and primary healthcare during pregnancy. This AI model uses variables that are easily collected to identify pregnant women at risk of developing GDM with a high level of accuracy and precision."

OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study was to verify whether genomic data is sufficient to predict a patient's personal information.
METHODS: RNA expression data and matched patient personal information were collected from 9538 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas program. Five personal information variables (age, gender, race, cancer type, and cancer stage) were recorded for each patient. Four different machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network) were used to determine whether a patient's personal information could be accurately predicted from RNA expression data. Performance measurement of the prediction models was based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We selected five cancer types (breast carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, low-grade glioma, and lung adenocarcinoma) with large samples sizes to verify whether predictive accuracy would differ between them. We also validated the efficacy of our four machine learning models in analyzing normal samples from 593 cancer patients.
RESULTS: In most samples, personal information with high genetic relevance, such as gender and cancer type, could be predicted from RNA expression data alone. The prediction accuracies for gender and cancer type, which were the best models, were 0.93-0.99 and 0.78-0.94, respectively. Other aspects of personal information, such as age, race, and cancer stage, were difficult to predict from RNA expression data, with accuracies ranging from 0.0026-0.29, 0.76-0.96, and 0.45-0.79, respectively. Among the tested machine learning methods, the highest predictive accuracy was obtained using the support vector machine algorithm (mean accuracy 0.77), while the lowest accuracy was obtained using the random forest method (mean accuracy 0.65). Gender and race were predicted more accurately than other variables in the samples. On average, the accuracy of cancer stage prediction ranged between 0.71-0.67, while the age prediction accuracy ranged between 0.18-0.23 for the five cancer types.
CONCLUSIONS: We attempted to predict patient information using RNA expression data. We found that some identifiers could be predicted, but most others could not. This study showed that personal information available from RNA expression data is limited and this information cannot be used to identify specific patients."

METHODS: We collected classroom dust from 24 junior high schools in three geographically distanced areas in Malaysia (Johor Bahru, Terengganu and Penang), and conducted culture-independent high-throughput microbiome and untargeted metabolomics/chemical profiling.
RESULTS: 1290 students were surveyed for asthma symptoms (wheeze). In each centre, we found significant variation in the prevalence of wheeze among schools, which could be explained by personal characteristics and air pollutants. Large-scale microbial variations were observed between the three centres; the potential protective bacteria were mainly from phyla Actinobacteria in Johor Bahru, Cyanobacteria in Terengganu and Proteobacteria in Penang. In total, 2633 metabolites and chemicals were characterised. Many metabolites were enriched in low-wheeze schools, including plant secondary metabolites flavonoids/isoflavonoids (isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, astragalin), indole and derivatives (indole, serotonin, 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde), and others (biotin, chavicol). A neural network analysis showed that the indole derivatives were co-occurring with the potential protective microbial taxa, including Actinomycetospora, Fischerella and Truepera, suggesting these microorganisms may pose health effects by releasing indole metabolites. A few synthetic chemicals were enriched in high-wheeze schools, including pesticides (2(3H)-benzothiazolethione), fragrances (2-aminobenzoic acid, isovaleric acid), detergents and plastics (phthalic acid), and industrial materials (4,4-sulfonyldiphenol).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first association study between high-throughput indoor chemical profiling and asthma symptoms. The consistent results from the three centres indicate that indoor metabolites/chemicals could be a better indicator than the indoor microbiome for environmental and health assessments, providing new insights for asthma prediction, prevention and control."

In view of this, this study aims to build a practical intraoperative hypothermia prediction model for clinical decision-making assistance. We retrospectively collected clinical data of patients who underwent gynecological laparoscopic surgery from June 2018 to May 2023, and constructed a multimodal algorithm prediction model based on this data. For the construction of the prediction model, all data are randomly divided into a training queue (70%) and a testing queue (30%), and then 3 types of machine learning algorithms are used, namely: random forest, artificial neural network, and generalized linear regression. The effectiveness evaluation of all predictive models relies on the comprehensive evaluation of the net benefit method using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. Finally, 1517 screened patients were filtered and 1429 participants were included for the construction of the predictive model. Among these, anesthesia time, pneumoperitoneum time, pneumoperitoneum flow rate, surgical time, intraoperative infusion, and room temperature were independent risk factors for intraoperative hypothermia and were listed as predictive variables. The random forest model algorithm combines 7 candidate variables to achieve optimal predictive performance in 2 queues, with an area under the curve of 0.893 and 0.887 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.835 to 0.951 and 0.829 to 0.945, respectively. The prediction efficiency of other prediction models is 0.783 and 0.821, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.725 to 0.841 and 0.763 to 0.879, respectively. The intraoperative hypothermia prediction model based on machine learning has satisfactory predictive performance, especially in random forests. This interpretable prediction model helps doctors evaluate the risk of intraoperative hypothermia, optimize clinical decision-making, and improve patient prognosis."

Early screening is crucial for management, yet current models focus mainly on ultrasound features. This study explores machine learning for screening using demographic and biochemical indicators.
METHODS: Analyzing data from 6,102 individuals and 61 variables, we identified 17 key variables to construct models using six machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Performance was evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, kappa statistic, and AUC, with internal and external validations assessing generalizability. Shapley values determined feature importance, and Decision Curve Analysis evaluated clinical benefits.
RESULTS: Random Forest showed the highest internal validation accuracy (78.3%) and AUC (89.1%). LightGBM demonstrated robust external validation performance. Key factors included age, gender, and urinary iodine levels, with significant clinical benefits at various thresholds. Clinical benefits were observed across various risk thresholds, particularly in ensemble models.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning, particularly ensemble methods, accurately predicts thyroid nodule presence using demographic and biochemical data. This cost-effective strategy offers valuable insights for thyroid health management, aiding in early detection and potentially improving clinical outcomes. These findings enhance our understanding of the key predictors of thyroid nodules and underscore the potential of machine learning in public health applications for early disease screening and prevention."

METHODS: This retrospective analysis included all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital from January 2010 to December 2019. The ANN model was constructed using parameters identical to the APACHE IV model. Discrimination performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC); calibration performance was evaluated using the Brier score and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
RESULTS: In total, 14 503 patients were included, with 10% in the validation set and 90% in the ANN model development set. The ANN model (AUROC=0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.86-0.90, Brier score=0.10; P in Hosmer-Lemeshow test=0.37) outperformed the APACHE II model (AUROC=0.85, 95% CI=0.80-0.85, Brier score=0.14; P<0.001 for both comparisons of AUROCs and Brier scores) but showed performance similar to the APACHE IV model (AUROC=0.87, 95% CI=0.85-0.89, Brier score=0.11; P=0.34 for comparison of AUROCs, and P=0.05 for comparison of Brier scores). The ANN model demonstrated better calibration than the APACHE II and APACHE IV models.
CONCLUSION: Our ANN model outperformed the APACHE II model but was similar to the APACHE IV model in terms of predicting hospital mortality in Hong Kong. Artificial neural networks are valuable tools that can enhance real-time prognostic prediction."

Epub 2019 Aug 14.,Zhong YJ,Resuscitation,2019,2019/08/18,,,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.07.036,"BACKGROUND: The current resuscitation guidelines for neonates recommend considering stopping resuscitation efforts if the heart rate remains undetectable after 10 min of adequate resuscitation. However, this recommendation does not take into account the gestational age (GA) of the neonates. We determined the outcomes of neonates with a 10-min Apgar score of zero (Apgar10 = 0) with respect to their GA.
METHODS: In a retrospective matched cohort study, we studied neonates admitted to the Canadian Neonatal Network NICUs between 2010 and 2016 with an Apgar10 = 0. The neonates were divided into 3 subgroups according to their GA: (1) ≥36 weeks', (2) 320/7-356/7 weeks', and (3) &lt;32 weeks'. Each neonate with Apgar10 = 0 was matched 1:1 with neonates of same GA and sex but Apgar10 = 1-2 and Apgar10 = 3-5. Survival and brain injury were compared between matched groups.
RESULTS: 177 neonates had Apgar10 = 0. Survival to discharge was significantly different between GA groups [≥36 weeks' 61% vs. 320/7-356/7 weeks' 58% vs. &lt;32 weeks' 35%, p = 0.04]. Survival to discharge was similar to their matched cohort with Apgar10 = 1-2 for neonates born at ≥36 weeks' (61% vs. 66%) and between 320/7 to 356/7 weeks' (58% vs. 54%), but significantly different for neonates &lt;32 weeks (35% vs. 61%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Neonates with Apgar10 = 0 had different outcomes depending on their GA. Less than half of neonates born at &lt;32 weeks GA survived; however, a majority of neonates born at 320/7-356/7 weeks' and ≥36 weeks' GA survived at similar rates than their matched neonates with Apgar10 = 1-2."

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study including infants born at 320/7 through 366/7 weeks of gestation and admitted to 25 NICUs participating in the Canadian Neonatal Network between 2015 and 2020. Patient characteristics, process measures represented by care practices, and outcome measures represented by clinical in-hospital and discharge outcomes were reported by gestational age weeks. NICUs were compared using indirect standardization after adjustment for patient characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 25 669 infants (17% of MLPIs born in Canada during the study period) included, 45% received deferred cord clamping, 7% had admission hypothermia, 47% received noninvasive respiratory support, 11% received mechanical ventilation, 8% received surfactant, 40% received antibiotics in the first 3 days, 4% did not receive feeding in the first 2 days, and 77% had vascular access. Mortality, early-onset sepsis, late-onset sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in <1% of the study cohort. Median (IQR) length of stay was 14 (9-21) days among infants discharged home from the admission hospital and 5 (3-9) days among infants transferred to community hospitals. Among infants discharged home, 33% were discharged on exclusive breastmilk and 75% on any breastmilk. There were significant variations between NICUs in all process and outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Care practices and outcomes of MLPIs varied significantly between Canadian NICUs. Standardization of process and outcome quality measures for this population will enable benchmarking and research, facilitating systemwide improvements."

The novel algorithm HALO confirmed AP-1, RUNX, and EGR TF activity controlling profibrotic gene programs and established TF-regulatory element-gene networks. This TF action atlas provides comprehensive insights into the transcriptional regulation of fibroblasts and macrophages in healthy and fibrotic human lungs."

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Schistosomiasis surveillance data were collected from a previous study based on a Hubei population sample including 4136 advanced schistosomiasis cases. The predictive models use LR, ANN, and DT methods. From each of the three groups, 70% of the cases (2896 cases) were used as training data for the predictive models. The remaining 30% of the cases (1240 cases) were used as validation groups for performance comparisons between the three models. Prediction performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Univariate analysis indicated that 16 risk factors were significantly associated with a patient's outcome of prognosis. In the training group, the mean AUC was 0.8276 for LR, 0.9267 for ANN, and 0.8229 for DT. In the validation group, the mean AUC was 0.8349 for LR, 0.8318 for ANN, and 0.8148 for DT. The three models yielded similar results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Predictive models for advanced schistosomiasis prognosis, respectively using LR, ANN and DT models were proved to be effective approaches based on our dataset. The ANN model outperformed the LR and DT models in terms of AUC."

This study is founded upon population health examination data and employs a comparison of eight distinct machine learning (ML) algorithms to construct the optimal screening model for identifying high-risk individuals with MAFLD in China.
METHODS: We collected physical examination data from 5,171,392 adults residing in the northwestern region of China, during the year 2021. Feature selection was conducted through the utilization of the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Additionally, class balancing parameters were incorporated into the models, accompanied by hyperparameter tuning, to effectively address the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets. This study encompassed the development of both tree-based ML models (including Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting) and alternative ML models (specifically, k-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Network) for the purpose of identifying individuals with MAFLD. Furthermore, we visualized the importance scores of each feature on the selected model.
RESULTS: The average age (standard deviation) of the 5,171,392 participants was 51.12 (15.00) years, with 52.47% of the participants being females. MAFLD was diagnosed by specialized physicians. 20 variables were finally included for analyses after LASSO regression model. Following ten rounds of cross-validation and parameter optimization for each algorithm, the CatBoost algorithm exhibited the best performance, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.862. The ranking of feature importance indicates that age, BMI, triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, occupation, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, ethnicity and cardiovascular diseases are the top 13 crucial factors for MAFLD screening.
CONCLUSION: This study utilized a large-scale, multi-ethnic physical examination data from the northwestern region of China to establish a more accurate and effective MAFLD risk screening model, offering a new perspective for the prediction and prevention of MAFLD."

Targeting BRCA1-BER deficient cells by blockade of ATM and DNA-PKcs could be a promising strategy in breast cancer. We investigated BRCA1, XRCC1 and pol β protein expression in two cohorts (n = 1602 sporadic and n = 50 germ-line BRCA1 mutated) and mRNA expression in two cohorts (n = 1952 and n = 249). Artificial neural network analysis for BRCA1-DNA repair interacting genes was conducted in 249 tumours. Pre-clinically, BRCA1 proficient and deficient cells were DNA repair expression profiled and evaluated for synthetic lethality using ATM and DNA-PKcs inhibitors either alone or in combination with cisplatin. In human tumours, BRCA1 negativity was strongly associated with low XRCC1, and low pol β at mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.0001). In patients with BRCA1 negative tumours, low XRCC1 or low pol β expression was significantly associated with poor survival in univariate and multivariate analysis compared to high XRCC1 or high pol β expressing BRCA1 negative tumours (ps < 0.05). Pre-clinically, BRCA1 negative cancer cells exhibit low mRNA and low protein expression of XRCC1 and pol β. BRCA1-BER deficient cells were sensitive to ATM and DNA-PKcs inhibitor treatment either alone or in combination with cisplatin and synthetic lethality was evidenced by DNA double strand breaks accumulation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We conclude that XRCC1 and pol β expression status in BRCA1 negative tumours may have prognostic significance. BRCA1-BER deficient cells could be targeted by ATM or DNA-PKcs inhibitors for personalized therapy."

Epub 2024 Sep 14.,Wang Y,Int J Med Inform,2024,2024/09/18,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105630,"BACKGROUND: New cases of lymphoma are rising, and the symptom burden, like cancer-related fatigue (CRF), severely impacts the quality of life of lymphoma survivors. However, clinical diagnosis and treatment of CRF are inadequate and require enhancement.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to construct machine learning-based CRF prediction models for lymphoma survivors to help healthcare professionals accurately identify the CRF population and better personalize treatment and care for patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study in China recruited lymphoma patients from June 2023 to March 2024, dividing them into two datasets for model construction and external validation. Six machine learning algorithms were used in this study: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Single Hidden Layer Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). Performance metrics like the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and calibration curves were compared. The clinical applicability was assessed by decision curve, and Shapley additive explanations was employed to explain variable significance.
RESULTS: CRF incidence was 40.7 % (dataset I) and 44.8 % (dataset II). LightGBM showed strong performance in training and internal validation. LR excelled in external validation with the highest AUROC and best calibration. Pain, total protein, physical function, and sleep disturbance were important predictors of CRF.
CONCLUSION: The study presents a machine learning-based CRF prediction model for lymphoma patients, offering dynamic, data-driven assessments that could enhance the development of automated CRF screening tools for personalized management in clinical practice."

OBJECTIVES: To understand the effectiveness of NPIs reported in the contemporary literatures describing prediction models for prevention of the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 specifically in Indian population.
METHODS: Original research articles in English obtained through keyword search in PubMed, WHO Global Database for COVID19, and pre-print servers were included in the review. Thematic synthesis of extracted data from articles were done.
RESULTS: Twenty-four articles were found eligible for the review - four published articles and twenty pre-print articles. Compartmental model was found to be the most commonly used mathematical model; along with exponential, time varying, neural network and cluster kinetic models. Social distancing, specifically lockdown, was the most commonly modelled intervention strategy. Additionally, contact tracing using smartphone application, international travel restriction, increasing hospital/ICU beds, changes in testing strategy were also dealt with. Social distancing along with increasing testing seemed to be effective in delaying the peak of the epidemic and reducing the peak prevalence.
CONCLUSION: Although there is mathematical rationality behind implementation of social distancing measures including lockdown, this study also emphasised the importance of other associated measures like increasing tests and increasing the number of hospital and ICU beds. The later components are particularly important during the social mixing period to be observed after lifting of lockdown."

The current study aimed at developing and comparing some statistical models to identify the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. In this light, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVMs), and multiple logistic regression (MLR) models were applied, using demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics, on a sample of 9528 individuals from Mashhad City in Iran.
METHODS: This study has randomly selected 6654 (70%) cases for training and reserved the remaining 2874 (30%) cases for testing. The three methods were compared with the help of ROC curve.
RESULTS: The prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes was 14% in our population. The ANN model had 78.7% accuracy, 63.1% sensitivity, and 81.2% specificity. Also, the values of these three parameters were 76.8%, 64.5%, and 78.9%, for SVM and 77.7%, 60.1%, and 80.5% for MLR. The area under the ROC curve was 0.71 for ANN, 0.73 for SVM, and 0.70 for MLR.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that ANN performs better than the two models (SVM and MLR) and can be used effectively to identify the associated risk factors of type 2 diabetes."

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3.6 million patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink registered at 391 general practices in England with linked hospital admission and mortality records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model performance including discrimination, calibration, and consistency of individual risk prediction for the same patients among models with comparable model performance. 19 different prediction techniques were applied, including 12 families of machine learning models (grid searched for best models), three Cox proportional hazards models (local fitted, QRISK3, and Framingham), three parametric survival models, and one logistic model.
RESULTS: The various models had similar population level performance (C statistics of about 0.87 and similar calibration). However, the predictions for individual risks of cardiovascular disease varied widely between and within different types of machine learning and statistical models, especially in patients with higher risks. A patient with a risk of 9.5-10.5% predicted by QRISK3 had a risk of 2.9-9.2% in a random forest and 2.4-7.2% in a neural network. The differences in predicted risks between QRISK3 and a neural network ranged between -23.2% and 0.1% (95% range). Models that ignored censoring (that is, assumed censored patients to be event free) substantially underestimated risk of cardiovascular disease. Of the 223 815 patients with a cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% with QRISK3, 57.8% would be reclassified below 7.5% when using another model.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of models predicted risks for the same patients very differently despite similar model performances. The logistic models and commonly used machine learning models should not be directly applied to the prediction of long term risks without considering censoring. Survival models that consider censoring and that are explainable, such as QRISK3, are preferable. The level of consistency within and between models should be routinely assessed before they are used for clinical decision making."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field (GARFIELD)-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients up to 1 year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within 30 days of enrolment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and had at least three measurements of PT-INR taken over the first 30 days after prescription were analysed. The AI model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n = 3185). Accuracy of the AI model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n = 1523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using serial PT-INR values collected within 1 month after starting VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12 months thereafter. Serial PT-INR values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes."

In the study, the feasibility of predicting HB incidence in Guangxi by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model method and Elman neural network (ElmanNN) method was discussed respectively, and the prediction accuracy of the two models was compared. Finally, we established the ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model and ElmanNN with 8 neurons. Both ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model and ElmanNN model had good performance, and their prediction accuracy were high. The fitting and prediction root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of ElmanNN were smaller than those of ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model, which indicated that ElmanNN was superior to ARIMA (0, 1, 1) model in predicting the incidence of hepatitis B in Guangxi. Based on the ElmanNN, the HB incidence from September 2019 to December 2020 in Guangxi was predicted, the predicted results showed that the incidence of HB in 2020 was slightly higher than that in 2019 and the change trend was similar to that in 2019, for 2021 and beyond, the ElmanNN model could be used to continue the predictive analysis."

This study aims to compare and explore the use of three data mining methods in our small spontaneous AE database.
METHODS: We consider reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) and Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) assuming two different sets of criteria: (1) ROR-1.96SE>1, IC-1.96SD>0, EB05>1 (2) ROR-1.96SE>2, IC-1.96SD>1, EB05 >2. Count of drug-AE pairs ≥3 was considered for ROR and GPS.
RESULTS: The Health Sciences Authority, Singapore received 151,180 AE reports between 1993 and 2013. ROR, BCPNN and GPS identified 2,835, 2,311 and 2,374 significant drug-AE pairs using Criterion 1, and 1,899, 1,101 and 1,358 respectively using Criterion 2. The performance of the three methods with respect to specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were similar, although ROR yielded a higher sensitivity and larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ROR and GPS picked up some potential signals which BCPNN missed.
CONCLUSIONS: The defined threshold used for ROR (Criterion 1) is a useful screening tool for our small database. It may be used in conjunction with GPS to avoid missed signals."

Although evidence is insufficient to recommend routine vitamin D screening in seniors, universal vitamin D supplementation is not desirable either. To rationalize vitamin D determination, our objective was to elaborate and test a clinical diagnostic tool for the identification of seniors with hypovitaminosis D without using a blood test.
DESIGN: Derivation of a clinical diagnostic tool using artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron; MLP) in randomized training subgroup of Prévention des Chutes, Réseau 4' cohort, and validation in randomized testing subgroup.
SETTING: Health Examination Centers of health insurance, Lyon, France.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1924 community-dwellers aged ≥ 65 years without vitamin D supplements, consecutively recruited between 2009 and 2012.
MEASUREMENTS: Hypovitaminosis D defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25OHD) concentration ≤ 75 nmol/L, ≤ 50 nmol/L, or ≤ 25 nmol/L. A set of clinical variables (age, gender, living alone, individual deprivation, body mass index, undernutrition, polymorbidity, number of drugs used daily, psychoactive drugs, biphosphonates, strontium, calcium supplements, falls, fear of falling, vertebral fractures, Timed Up and Go, walking aids, lower-limb proprioception, handgrip strength, visual acuity, wearing glasses, cognitive disorders, sad mood) were recorded. Several MLPs, based on varying amounts of variables according to their relative importance, were tested consecutively.
RESULTS: A total of 1729 participants (89.9%) had 25OHD ≤ 75 nmol/L, 1288 (66.9%) had 25OHD ≤ 50 nmol/L, and 525 (27.2%) had 25OHD ≤ 25 nmol/L. MLP using 16 clinical variables was able to diagnose hypovitaminosis D ≤ 75 nmol/L with accuracy = 96.3%, area under curve (AUC) = 0.938, and κ = 79.3 indicating almost perfect agreement. It was also able to diagnose hypovitaminosis D ≤ 50 nmol/L with accuracy = 81.5, AUC = 0.867, and κ = 57.8 (moderate agreement); and hypovitaminosis D ≤ 25 nmol/L with accuracy = 82.5, AUC = 0.385, and κ = 55.0 (moderate agreement).
CONCLUSIONS: We elaborated an algorithm able to identify, from 16 clinical variables, seniors with hypovitaminosis D."

STUDY DESIGN: In a retrospective cohort study, we included data from preterm infants of 22-25 weeks of gestation admitted to neonatal intensive care units participating in the Canadian Neonatal Network between 2010 and 2017. Infants with major congenital anomalies were excluded. We calculated gestational age using in vitro fertilization date, antenatal ultrasound dating, last menstrual period, obstetrical estimate, or neonatal estimate (in that order). Infants were followed until either discharge or death. Each day of gestational age was considered a category except for births at 22 weeks, where the first 4 days were grouped into one category and the last 3 days were grouped into another category. For each day of life, an actuarial survival rate was obtained by calculating how many infants survived to discharge out of those who had survived up to that day.
RESULTS: Of 4335 included infants, 85, 679, 1504, and 2067 were born at 22, 23, 24, and 25 weeks of gestation, respectively. Survival increased from 32% at 22 weeks to 83% at 254-6/7 weeks. Graphs of actuarial survival developed for the first 6 weeks after birth in male and female children indicated a steep increase in survival during the first 7-10 days postnatally.
CONCLUSIONS: Survival increased steadily with postnatal survival and was dependent on gestational age in days and sex of the child."

However, the concern regarding adverse events (AEs) of cardiac therapy drugs have been rising. This study aimed to analyse cardiac therapy drug-related AEs using the Jinan adverse event reporting system (JAERS) database mining and conduct a comprehensive evaluation to provide safe medication information for patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: In this study, cardiac therapy drug-related AEs were detected using the JAERS database from January 2000 to March 2022.
METHODS: Reports of cardiac therapy drug-related AEs were extracted from JAERS database, and the basic information of patients, reports and common AEs were analysed. Four disproportionality analysis methods, proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), were used to detect cardiac therapy drug-related signals. We further checked whether the detected signals exist on drug labels in China and two developed countries, the USA and Japan.
RESULTS: In total, 168 314 AEs were reported, of which 4788 were associated with cardiac therapy drugs. Using the PRR, ROR, MHRA and BCPNN method, we detected 52 signals, 52 signals, 33 signals and 43 signals, respectively. Among the 52 signals, 14 were not included on the drug labels of China. One (isosorbide mononitrate-head bilges) was not included on the drug labels of the three countries.
CONCLUSION: We identified 14 new cardiac therapy drug signals that did not appear on drug labels in China and 1 new signal that did not appear on drug labels in 3 counties. A causal link between cardiac therapy drugs and AEs should be evaluated in further studies."

Epub 2024 Aug 6.,Huang CC,Int J Med Inform,2024,2024/08/14,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105590,"BACKGROUND: Prediction of mortality is very important for care planning in hospitalized patients with dementia and artificial intelligence has the potential to serve as a solution; however, this issue remains unclear. Thus, this study was conducted to elucidate this matter.
METHODS: We identified 10,573 hospitalized patients aged ≥ 45 years with dementia from three hospitals between 2010 and 2020 for this study. Utilizing 44 feature variables extracted from electronic medical records, an artificial intelligence (AI) model was constructed to predict death during hospitalization. The data was randomly separated into 70 % training set and 30 % testing set. We compared predictive accuracy among six algorithms including logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, another set of data collected in 2021 was used as the validation set to assess the performance of six algorithms.
RESULTS: The average age was 79.8 years, with females constituting 54.5 % of the sample. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.7 %. LightGBM exhibited the highest area under the curve (0.991) for predicting mortality compared to other algorithms (XGBoost: 0.987, random forest: 0.985, logistic regression: 0.918, MLP: 0.898, SVM: 0.897). The accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LightGBM were 0.943, 0.944, 0.943, 0.542, and 0.996, respectively. Among the features in LightGBM, the three most important variables were the Glasgow Coma Scale, respiratory rate, and blood urea nitrogen. In the validation set, the area under the curve of LightGBM reached 0.753.
CONCLUSIONS: The AI prediction model demonstrates strong accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality among patients with dementia, suggesting its potential implementation to enhance future care quality."

Due to the limitations of usual statistical models, other methods such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and hybrid models could be used. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA) model to prediction the occurrence of heart block and death in myocardial infarction (MI) patients simultaneously.
METHODS: For fitting and comparing the models, 263 new patients with definite diagnosis of MI hospitalized in Cardiology Ward of Hajar Hospital, Shahrekord, Iran, from March, 2014 to March, 2016 were enrolled. Occurrence of heart block and death were employed as bivariate binary outcomes. Bivariate Logistic Regression (BLR), ANN and hybrid ANN-GA models were fitted to data. Prediction accuracy was used to compare the models. The codes were written in Matlab 2013a and Zelig package in R3.2.2.
RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of BLR, ANN and hybrid ANN-GA models was obtained 77.7%, 83.69% and 93.85% for the training and 78.48%, 84.81% and 96.2% for the test data, respectively. In both training and test data set, hybrid ANN-GA model had better accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: ANN model could be a suitable alternative for modeling and predicting bivariate binary responses when the presuppositions of statistical models are not met in actual data. In addition, using optimization methods, such as hybrid ANN-GA model, could improve precision of ANN model."

We developed an automated approach to predict the occurrence of any second breast cancer (SBC) using patient-level data and explored the generalizability of the models with an external validation data source. Breast cancer patients from the cancer registry of Zurich, Zug, Schaffhausen, Schwyz (N = 3213; training dataset) and the cancer registry of Ticino (N = 1073; external validation dataset), diagnosed between 2010 and 2018, were used for model training and validation, respectively. Machine learning (ML) methods, namely a feed-forward neural network (ANN), logistic regression, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were employed for classification. The best-performing model was selected based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Key characteristics contributing to a high SBC risk were identified. SBC was diagnosed in 6% of all cases. The most important features for SBC prediction were age at incidence, year of birth, stage, and extent of the pathological primary tumor. The ANN model had the highest area under the ROC curve with 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.750.82) in the training data and 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79) in the external validation data. Investigating the generalizability of different ML algorithms, we found that the ANN generalized better than the other models on the external validation data. This research is a first step towards the development of an automated tool that could assist clinicians in the identification of women at high risk of developing an SBC and potentially preventing it."

CKD affects different outcomes relevant to older persons, additionally to morbidity and mortality which makes CKD a relevant health burden in this population. Still, accurate laboratory measurement of kidney function is under debate, since current creatinine-based equations have a certain degree of inaccuracy when used in the older population. The aims of the study are as follows: to assess kidney function in a cohort of 75+ older persons using existing methodologies for CKD screening; to investigate existing and innovative biomarkers of CKD in this cohort, and to align laboratory and biomarker results with medical and functional data obtained from this cohort. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02691546, February 25th 2016.
METHODS/DESIGN: An observational, multinational, multicenter, prospective cohort study in community dwelling persons aged 75 years and over, visiting the outpatient clinics of participating institutions. The study will enroll 2450 participants and is carried out in Austria, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Participants will undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations at baseline and after 12 and 24 months- follow-up. Clinical evaluation also includes a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Local laboratory will be used for 'basic' parameters (including serum creatinine and albumin-to-creatinine ratio), whereas biomarker assessment will be conducted centrally. An intermediate telephone follow-up will be carried out at 6 and 18 months.
DISCUSSION: Combining the use of CGA and the investigation of novel and existing independent biomarkers within the SCOPE study will help to provide evidence in the development of European guidelines and recommendations in the screening and management of CKD in older people.

Tumour marker-based blood tests offer a potential alternative. However, the sensitivity of current clinical protein detection technologies is inadequate for identifying low-abundance circulating tumour biomarkers, leading to poor discrimination between individuals with and without cancer. We aimed to develop a highly sensitive blood test tool to improve detection of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: We designed a detection platform named SENSORS and validated its effectiveness by comparing its performance in detecting the selected serological biomarkers MMP13 and SCC against ELISA and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). We then developed a SENSORS-based oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma adjunct diagnostic system (with potential applications in screening and triage under clinical supervision) to classify individuals with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and healthy controls in a retrospective study including participants (cohort I) from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC; Guangzhou, China), Henan Cancer Hospital (HNCH; Zhengzhou, China), and Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College (CHSUMC; Shantou, China). The inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, pathologically confirmed primary oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and no cancer treatments before serum sample collection. Participants without oesophageal-related diseases were recruited from the health examination department as the control group. The SENSORS-based diagnostic system is based on a multivariable logistic regression model that uses the detection values of SENSORS as the input and outputs a risk score for the predicted likelihood of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We further evaluated the clinical utility of the system in an independent prospective multicentre study with different participants selected from the same three institutions. Patients with newly diagnosed oesophageal-related diseases without previous cancer treatment were enrolled. The inclusion criteria for healthy controls were no obvious abnormalities in routine blood and tumour marker tests, no oesophageal-associated diseases, and no history of cancer. Finally, we assessed whether classification could be improved by integrating machine-learning algorithms with the system, which combined baseline clinical characteristics, epidemiological risk factors, and serological tumour marker concentrations. Retrospective SYSUCC cohort I (randomly assigned [7:3] to a training set and an internal validation set) and three prospective validation sets (SYSUCC cohort II [internal validation], HNCH cohort II [external validation], and CHSUMC cohort II [external validation]) were used in this step. Six machine-learning algorithms were compared (the least absolute shrinkage and selector operator regression, ridge regression, random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, and neural network), and the best-performing algorithm was chosen as the final prediction model. Performance of SENSORS and the SENSORS-based diagnostic system was primarily assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2017, and April 30, 2020, 1051 participants were included in the retrospective study. In the prospective diagnostic study, 924 participants were included from April 2, 2022, to Feb 2, 2023. Compared with ELISA (108·90 pg/mL) and ECLIA (41·79 pg/mL), SENSORS (243·03 fg/mL) showed 448 times and 172 times improvements, respectively. In the three retrospective validation sets, the SENSORS-based diagnostic system achieved AUCs of 0·95 (95% CI 0·90-0·99) in the SYSUCC internal validation set, 0·93 (0·89-0·97) in the HNCH external validation set, and 0·98 (0·97-1·00) in the CHSUMC external validation set, sensitivities of 87·1% (79·3-92·3), 98·6% (94·4-99·8), and 93·5% (88·1-96·7), and specificities of 88·9% (75·2-95·8), 74·6% (61·3-84·6), and 92·1% (81·7-97·0), respectively, successfully distinguishing between patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and healthy controls. Additionally, in three prospective validation cohorts, it yielded sensitivities of 90·9% (95% CI 86·1-94·2) for SYSUCC, 84·8% (76·1-90·8) for HNCH, and 95·2% (85·6-98·7) for CHSUMC. Of the six machine-learning algorithms compared, the random forest model showed the best performance. A feature selection step identified five features to have the highest performance to predictions (SCC, age, MMP13, CEA, and NSE) and a simplified random forest model using these five features further improved classification, achieving sensitivities of 98·2% (95% CI 93·2-99·7) in the internal validation set from retrospective SYSUCC cohort I, 94·1% (89·9-96·7) in SYSUCC prospective cohort II, 88·6% (80·5-93·7) in HNCH prospective cohort II, and 98·4% (90·2-99·9) in CHSUMC prospective cohort II.
INTERPRETATION: The SENSORS system facilitates highly sensitive detection of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma tumour biomarkers, overcoming the limitations of detecting low-abundance circulating proteins, and could substantially improve oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma diagnostics. This method could act as a minimally invasive screening tool, potentially reducing the need for unnecessary endoscopies.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Inadequate evidence exists to determine how best to treat infants with gastroschisis.
METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted of data collected 2006-2008 using the British Association of Pediatric Surgeons Congenital Anomalies Surveillance System, and 2005-2016 using the Canadian Pediatric Surgery Network.28-day outcomes were compared between infants undergoing PC and SR. Primary outcome was number of gastrointestinal complications. Interactions were investigated between infant characteristics and treatment to determine whether intervention effect varied in sub-groups of infants.
RESULTS: Data from 341 British and Irish infants (27%) and 927 Canadian infants (73%) were used. 671 infants (42%) underwent PC and 597 (37%) underwent SR. The effect of SR on outcome varied according to the presence/absence of intestinal perforation, intestinal matting and intestinal necrosis. In infants without these features, SR was associated with fewer gastrointestinal complications [aIRR 0.25 (95% CI 0.09-0.67, P = 0.006)], more operations [aIRR 1.40 (95% CI 1.22-1.60, P < 0.001)], more days PN [aIRR 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13, P < 0.001)], and a higher infection risk [aOR 2.06 (95% CI 1.10-3.87, P = 0.025)]. In infants with these features, SR was associated with a greater number of operations [aIRR 1.30 (95% CI 1.17-1.45, P < 0.001)], and more days PN [aIRR 1.06 (95% CI 1.02-1.10, P = 0.003)].
CONCLUSIONS: In infants without intestinal perforation, matting, or necrosis, the benefits of SR outweigh its drawbacks. In infants with these features, the opposite is true. Treatment choice should be based upon these features."

We conducted a mixed-methods cross-sectional observational study to assess the usability and acceptability of HCVST among people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG) people in Tbilisi, Georgia.
METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2019 to June 2020 among PWID at one harm reduction site and among MSM/TG at one community-based organization. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Usability was assessed by observing errors made and difficulties faced by participants. Acceptability was assessed using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire. A subset of participants participated in cognitive and in-depth interviews.
RESULTS: A total of 90 PWID, 84 MSM and 6 TG were observed performing HCVST. PWID were older (median age 35 vs 24) and had a lower level of education compared to MSM/TG (27% vs 59%). The proportion of participants who completed all steps successfully without assistance was 60% among PWID and 80% among MSM/TG. The most common error was in sample collection and this was observed more often among PWID than MSM/TG (21% vs 6%; p = 0.002). More PWID requested assistance during HCVST compared to MSM/TG (22% vs 8%; p = 0.011). Acceptability was high in both groups (98% vs 96%; p = 0.407). Inter-reader agreement was 97% among PWID and 99% among MSM/TG. Qualitative data from cognitive (n = 20) and in-depth interviews (n = 20) was consistent with the quantitative data confirming a high usability and acceptability.
CONCLUSIONS: HCVST was highly acceptable among key populations in Georgia of relatively high educational level, and most participants performed HCVST correctly. A significant difference in usability was observed among PWID compared to MSM/TG, indicating that PWID may benefit from improved messaging and education as well as options to receive direct assistance when self-testing for HCV."

We aimed to generate and validate a risk tool that predicts adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: Using logistic regression models, we generated a risk tool in a representative population cohort (ALSPAC - UK, 5113 participants, followed from birth to age 17) using childhood clinical and sociodemographic data with internal validation. Predictors included sex, socioeconomic status, single-parent family, ADHD symptoms, comorbid disruptive disorders, childhood maltreatment, ADHD symptoms, depressive symptoms, mother's depression and intelligence quotient. The outcome was defined as a categorical diagnosis of ADHD in young adulthood without requiring age at onset criteria. We also tested Machine Learning approaches for developing the risk models: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network. The risk tool was externally validated in the E-Risk cohort (UK, 2040 participants, birth to age 18), the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil, 3911 participants, birth to age 18) and the MTA clinical sample (USA, 476 children with ADHD and 241 controls followed for 16 years from a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 26 years old).
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of adult ADHD ranged from 8.1 to 12% in the population-based samples, and was 28.6% in the clinical sample. The internal performance of the model in the generating sample was good, with an area under the curve (AUC) for predicting adult ADHD of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.83). Calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed event frequencies from 0 to 60% probability. In the UK birth cohort test sample, the AUC was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78). In the Brazilian birth cohort test sample, the AUC was significantly lower -0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60). In the clinical trial test sample, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80). The risk model did not predict adult anxiety or major depressive disorder. Machine Learning approaches did not outperform logistic regression models. An open-source and free risk calculator was generated for clinical use and is available online at https://ufrgs.br/prodah/adhd-calculator/.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk tool based on childhood characteristics specifically predicts adult ADHD in European and North-American population-based and clinical samples with comparable discrimination to commonly used clinical tools in internal medicine and higher than most previous attempts for mental and neurological disorders. However, its use in middle-income settings requires caution."

Social media platforms, such as Twitter (Twitter, Inc), offer vast amounts of real-world data. An important aspect of incorporating social media data in scientific research is identifying the demographic characteristics of the users who posted those data. Age and gender are considered key demographics for assessing the representativeness of the sample and enable researchers to study subgroups and disparities effectively. However, deciphering the age and gender of social media users poses challenges.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to summarize the existing literature on the prediction of the age and gender of Twitter users and provide an overview of the methods used.
METHODS: We searched 15 electronic databases and carried out reference checking to identify relevant studies that met our inclusion criteria: studies that predicted the age or gender of Twitter users using computational methods. The screening process was performed independently by 2 researchers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the included studies.
RESULTS: Of the initial 684 studies retrieved, 74 (10.8%) studies met our inclusion criteria. Among these 74 studies, 42 (57%) focused on predicting gender, 8 (11%) focused on predicting age, and 24 (32%) predicted a combination of both age and gender. Gender prediction was predominantly approached as a binary classification task, with the reported performance of the methods ranging from 0.58 to 0.96 F<sub>1</sub>-score or 0.51 to 0.97 accuracy. Age prediction approaches varied in terms of classification groups, with a higher range of reported performance, ranging from 0.31 to 0.94 F<sub>1</sub>-score or 0.43 to 0.86 accuracy. The heterogeneous nature of the studies and the reporting of dissimilar performance metrics made it challenging to quantitatively synthesize results and draw definitive conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that although automated methods for predicting the age and gender of Twitter users have evolved to incorporate techniques such as deep neural networks, a significant proportion of the attempts rely on traditional machine learning methods, suggesting that there is potential to improve the performance of these tasks by using more advanced methods. Gender prediction has generally achieved a higher reported performance than age prediction. However, the lack of standardized reporting of performance metrics or standard annotated corpora to evaluate the methods used hinders any meaningful comparison of the approaches. Potential biases stemming from the collection and labeling of data used in the studies was identified as a problem, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and mitigation of biases in future studies. This scoping review provides valuable insights into the methods used for predicting the age and gender of Twitter users, along with the challenges and considerations associated with these methods."

Patients are sometimes already infected at the time of admission to the hospital (referred to as ""importation""), and additional patients might get infected in the hospital through transmission (""nosocomial infection""). Since many of these importation and nosocomial infection cases may present no symptoms (i.e., ""asymptomatic""), rapidly identifying them is difficult since testing is limited and incurs significant delays. Although there has been a lot of work on examining the utility of both mathematical models of transmission and machine learning for identifying patients at risk of MDRO infections in recent years, these methods have limited performance and suffer from different drawbacks: Transmission modeling-based methods do not make full use of rich data contained in electronic health records (EHR), while machine learning-based methods typically lack information about mechanistic processes. In this work, we propose NEURABM, a new framework which integrates both neural networks and agent-based models (ABM) to combine the advantages of both modeling-based and machine learning-based methods. NEURABM simultaneously learns a neural network model for patient-level prediction of importation, as well as the ABM model which is used for identifying infections. Our results demonstrate that NEURABM identifies importation and nosocomial infection cases more accurately than existing methods."

OBJECTIVE: To develop a neural network model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) for evaluating GFR in Chinese NLUTD patients, and compare the diagnostic performance with Cr-based multiple linear regression equations for Chinese and the CKD-EPI<sub>cr</sub> equation without race.
DESIGN: Single-center, cross-sectional study of GFR estimation from serum Cr, demographic data, and clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with NLUTD.
PATIENTS: A total of 204 NLUTD patients, from 27 different geographic regions of China, were selected. A random sample of 141 of these subjects was included in the training sample set, and the remaining 63 patients were included in the testing sample set.
METHODS: The reference GFR (rGFR) was assessed by the technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) double plasma sample method. A neural network model based on MLP was developed to evaluate GFR in the training sample set, which was then validated in the testing sample set and compared with Cr-based GFR equations.
RESULTS: The MLP-based model showed significant performance improvement in evaluating the difference, absolute difference, precision, and accuracy of GFR estimation compared with the Cr-based GFR equations. Additionally, compared with the rGFR, we found that the MLP-based model provided an acceptable level of accuracy (greater than 85%, which was within a 30% deviation from the rGFR).
CONCLUSION: The MLP-based model offered significant advantages in estimating GFR in Chinese NLUTD patients, and its application could be suggested in clinical practice."

Epub 2024 Jun 18.,Choi BM,Clin Ther,2024,2024/06/19,,,10.1016/j.clinthera.2024.05.003,"PURPOSE: The study aimed to compare the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) preventive effect of repeated administration of ramosetron with the standard treatment group and compare models to predict the incidence of PONV using machine-learning techniques.
METHODS: A total of 261 patients scheduled for breast surgery were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of repeated intravenous administration of ramosetron. All patients were administered 0.3 mg ramosetron just before the end of surgery. For the repeated dose of ramosetron group, an additional dose of 0.3 mg was administered at 4, 22, and 46 hours after the end of the surgery. Postoperative nausea, vomiting, and retching were evaluated using the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching at 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. Previously published randomized controlled data were combined with the data of this study to create a new dataset of 1390 patients, and machine-learning-based PONV prediction models (classification tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and neural network) was constructed and compared with the Apfel model.
FINDINGS: Fifty patients (38.5%) and 60 patients (45.8%) reported nausea, vomiting, or retching 48 hours postoperatively in the standard and repeated-dose groups, respectively (P = 0.317, χ2 test). Median sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the Apfel model analyzed using the training set were 0.815, 0.344, and 0.495, respectively.
IMPLICATIONS: The repeated administration of ramosetron did not reduce the incidence of PONV. The Apfel model had high sensitivity, however, its specificity and accuracy were lower than that in machine-learning-based models."

The aim of this study was to examine the age effect on the performance criteria of the 10-item brief geriatric assessment (BGA) for the prolonged length of hospital stay (LHS) using artificial neural networks (ANNs) analysis.
METHODS: Based on an observational prospective cohort study, 1117 older patients (i.e., aged ≥ 65 years) ED users were admitted to acute care wards in a University Hospital (France) were recruited. The 10-items of BGA were recorded during the ED visit and prior to discharge to acute care wards. The top third of LHS (i.e., ≥ 13 days) defined the prolonged LHS. Analysis was successively performed on participants categorized in 4 age groups: aged ≥ 70, ≥ 75, ≥ 80 and ≥ 85 years. Performance criteria of 10-item BGA for the prolonged LHS were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV], likelihood ratios [LR], area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]). The ANNs analysis method was conducted using the modified multilayer perceptron (MLP).
RESULTS: Values of criteria performance were high (sensitivity> 89%, specificity≥ 96%, PPV > 87%, NPV > 96%, LR+ > 22; LR- ≤ 0.1 and AUROC> 93), regardless of the age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Age effect on the performance criteria of the 10-item BGA for the prediction of prolonged LHS using MLP was minimal with a good balance between criteria, suggesting that this tool may be used as a screening as well as a predictive tool for prolonged LHS."

Several tools have been developed for this purpose, but there is room for improvement. Machine learning is an increasingly popular and flexible method of prediction model building based on a data set. It raises some skepticism, however, because of the complex structure of these models.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were (1) to develop machine learning algorithms for 90-day and 1-year survival in patients who received surgical treatment for a bone metastasis of the extremity, and (2) to use these algorithms to identify those clinical factors (demographic, treatment related, or surgical) that are most closely associated with survival after surgery in these patients.
METHODS: All 1090 patients who underwent surgical treatment for a long-bone metastasis at two institutions between 1999 and 2017 were included in this retrospective study. The median age of the patients in the cohort was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR] 54 to 72 years), 56% of patients (610 of 1090) were female, and the median BMI was 27 kg/m (IQR 23 to 30 kg/m). The most affected location was the femur (70%), followed by the humerus (22%). The most common primary tumors were breast (24%) and lung (23%). Intramedullary nailing was the most commonly performed type of surgery (58%), followed by endoprosthetic reconstruction (22%), and plate screw fixation (14%). Missing data were imputed using the missForest methods. Features were selected by random forest algorithms, and five different models were developed on the training set (80% of the data): stochastic gradient boosting, random forest, support vector machine, neural network, and penalized logistic regression. These models were chosen as a result of their classification capability in binary datasets. Model performance was assessed on both the training set and the validation set (20% of the data) by discrimination, calibration, and overall performance.
RESULTS: We found no differences among the five models for discrimination, with an area under the curve ranging from 0.86 to 0.87. All models were well calibrated, with intercepts ranging from -0.03 to 0.08 and slopes ranging from 1.03 to 1.12. Brier scores ranged from 0.13 to 0.14. The stochastic gradient boosting model was chosen to be deployed as freely available web-based application and explanations on both a global and an individual level were provided. For 90-day survival, the three most important factors associated with poorer survivorship were lower albumin level, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and rapid growth primary tumor. For 1-year survival, the three most important factors associated with poorer survivorship were lower albumin level, rapid growth primary tumor, and lower hemoglobin level.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the final models must be externally validated, the algorithms showed good performance on internal validation. The final models have been incorporated into a freely accessible web application that can be found at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/extremitymetssurvival/. Pending external validation, clinicians may use this tool to predict survival for their individual patients to help in shared treatment decision making.

Epub 2024 Aug 26.,Germer S,Int J Med Inform,2024,2024/08/29,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105607,"INTRODUCTION: Survival analysis based on cancer registry data is of paramount importance for monitoring the effectiveness of health care. As new methods arise, the compendium of statistical tools applicable to cancer registry data grows. In recent years, machine learning approaches for survival analysis were developed. The aim of this study is to compare the model performance of the well established Cox regression and novel machine learning approaches on a previously unused dataset.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is based on lung cancer data from the Schleswig-Holstein Cancer Registry. Four survival analysis models are compared: Cox Proportional Hazard Regression (CoxPH) as the most commonly used statistical model, as well as Random Survival Forests (RSF) and two neural network architectures based on the DeepSurv and TabNet approaches. The models are evaluated using the concordance index (C-I), the Brier score and the AUC-ROC score. In addition, to gain more insight in the decision process of the models, we identified the features that have an higher impact on patient survival using permutation feature importance scores and SHAP values.
RESULTS: Using a dataset including the cancer stage established by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), the best performing model is the CoxPH (C-I: 0.698±0.005), while using a dataset which includes the tumor size, lymph node and metastasis status (TNM) leads to the RSF as best performing model (C-I: 0.703±0.004). The explainability metrics show that the models rely on the combined UICC stage and the metastasis status in the first place, which corresponds to other studies.
DISCUSSION: The studied methods are highly relevant for epidemiological researchers to create more accurate survival models, which can help physicians make informed decisions about appropriate therapies and management of patients with lung cancer, ultimately improving survival and quality of life."

Identifying how NPS cluster in bvFTD may clarify the underlying neurobiology of bvFTD-related NPS and guide development of therapies.
METHODOLOGY: Participants (N=354) with sporadic and genetic bvFTD were enrolled in the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Consortium. Dementia stage was defined as early (CDR® plus NACC FTLD ≤ 1) or advanced (CDR® plus NACC FTLD ≥ 1). Baseline and annual follow-up visit data were analyzed to compare NPS across stages of bvFTD. Psychiatric states were captured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and Clinician Judgement of Symptoms. Polychoric cluster analysis was used to describe NPS clusters.
RESULTS: NPS were highly prevalent (≥ 90%) in early and late bvFTD. Four NPS clusters were identified based on magnitude of factor loadings: affective, disinhibited, compulsive, and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms fluctuated across visits. In the affective cluster, depression and anxiety showed the least visit-to-visit stability. In the disinhibited cluster, elation showed the least stability. Symptoms in the psychosis and compulsive clusters (hallucinations, delusions, obsessions/compulsions, and hyperorality) were largely stable, persisting from visit-to-visit in more than 50% of cases.
CONCLUSION: NPS in bvFTD are frequent and cluster into four discrete groups in bvFTD. These clusters may result from specific neural network disruptions that could serve as targets for future interventions. The fluctuating nature of NPS in bvFTD suggests that they are not reliable markers of disease progression or stage."

Thus, simplified diagnosis techniques become necessary.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to analyze the blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) signal from nocturnal oximetry by means of features from the wavelet transform in order to characterize pediatric SAHS; (ii) to evaluate the usefulness of the extracted features to assist in the detection of pediatric SAHS.
METHODS: 981 SpO2 signals from children ranging 2-13 years of age were used. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was employed due to its suitability to deal with non-stationary signals as well as the ability to analyze the SAHS-related low frequency components of the SpO2 signal with high resolution. In addition, 3% oxygen desaturation index (ODI3), statistical moments and power spectral density (PSD) features were computed. Fast correlation-based filter was applied to select a feature subset. This subset fed three classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and multilayer perceptron) trained to determine the presence of moderate-to-severe pediatric SAHS (apnea-hypopnea index cutoff ≥ 5 events per hour).
RESULTS: The wavelet entropy and features computed in the D9 detail level of the DWT reached significant differences associated with the presence of SAHS. All the proposed classifiers fed with a selected feature subset composed of ODI3, statistical moments, PSD, and DWT features outperformed every single feature. SVM reached the highest performance. It achieved 84.0% accuracy (71.9% sensitivity, 91.1% specificity), outperforming state-of-the-art studies in the detection of moderate-to-severe SAHS using the SpO2 signal alone.
CONCLUSION: Wavelet analysis could be a reliable tool to analyze the oximetry signal in order to assist in the automated detection of moderate-to-severe pediatric SAHS. Hence, pediatric subjects suffering from moderate-to-severe SAHS could benefit from an accurate simplified screening test only using the SpO2 signal."

Online ahead of print.,Yi N,J Nurs Scholarsh,2024,2024/09/12,,,10.1111/jnu.13024,"INTRODUCTION: Accurate and rapid triage can reduce undertriage and overtriage, which may improve emergency department flow. This study aimed to identify the effects of a prospective study applying artificial intelligence-based triage in the clinical field.
DESIGN: Systematic review of prospective studies.
METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, ProQuest, KISS, and RISS were searched from March 9 to April 18, 2023. All the data were screened independently by three researchers. The review included prospective studies that measured outcomes related to AI-based triage. Three researchers extracted data and independently assessed the study's quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) protocol.
RESULTS: Of 1633 studies, seven met the inclusion criteria for this review. Most studies applied machine learning to triage, and only one was based on fuzzy logic. All studies, except one, utilized a five-level triage classification system. Regarding model performance, the feed-forward neural network achieved a precision of 33% in the level 1 classification, whereas the fuzzy clip model achieved a specificity and sensitivity of 99%. The accuracy of the model's triage prediction ranged from 80.5% to 99.1%. Other outcomes included time reduction, overtriage and undertriage checks, mistriage factors, and patient care and prognosis outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Triage nurses in the emergency department can use artificial intelligence as a supportive means for triage. Ultimately, we hope to be a resource that can reduce undertriage and positively affect patient health.

A systematic comparison of statistical discovery methods for spontaneous reporting systems,"Dijkstra L, Garling M, Foraita R, Pigeot I.",Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2020 Apr;29(4):396-403. doi: 10.1002/pds.4970. Epub 2020 Feb 24.,Dijkstra L,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,2020,2020/02/25,,,10.1002/pds.4970,"PURPOSE: Spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) are used to discover previously unknown relationships between drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A plethora of statistical methods have been proposed over the years to identify these drug-ADR pairs. The objective of this study is to compare a wide variety of methods in their ability to detect these signals, especially when their detection is complicated by the presence of innocent bystanders (drugs that are mistaken to be associated with the ADR, since they are prescribed together with the drug that is the ADR's actual cause).
METHODS: Twelve methods, 24 measures in total, ranging from simple disproportionality measures (eg, the reporting odds ratio), hypothesis tests (eg, test of the Poisson mean), Bayesian shrinkage estimates (eg, the Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, BCPNN) to sparse regression (LASSO), are compared in their ability to detect drug-ADR pairs in a large number of simulated SRSs with varying numbers of innocent bystanders and effect sizes. The area under the precision-recall curve is used to assess the measures' performance.
RESULTS: Hypothesis tests (especially the test of the Poisson mean) perform best when the associations are weak and there is little to no confounding by other drugs. When the level of confounding increases and/or the effect sizes become larger, Bayesian shrinkage methods should be preferred. The LASSO proves to be the most robust against the innocent bystander effect.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no absolute ""winner"". Which method to use for a particular SRS depends on the effect sizes and the level of confounding present in the data."

Iron supplementation is recommended but improvement of iron status requires good adherence.
OBJECTIVES: We explored factors affecting adolescent adherence to weekly iron and/or folic acid supplements in a setting of low secondary school attendance.
METHODS: Taped in-depth interviews were conducted with participants in a randomised, controlled, periconceptional iron supplementation trial for young nulliparous women living in a rural, malaria endemic region of Burkina Faso. Participants with good, medium or poor adherence were selected. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine interviews were conducted. The community initially thought supplements were contraceptives. The potential benefits of giving iron supplementation to unmarried ""girls"" ahead of pregnancy were not recognised. Trial participation, which required parental consent, remained high but was not openly admitted because iron supplements were thought to be contraceptives. Unmarried non-school attenders, being mobile, were often sent to provide domestic labour in varied locations. This interrupted adherence - as did movement of school girls during vacations and at marriage. Field workers tracked participants and trial provision of free treatment encouraged adherence. Most interviewees did not identify health benefits from taking supplements.
CONCLUSIONS: For success, communities must be convinced of the value of an adolescent intervention. During this safety trial, benefits not routinely available in iron supplementation programmes were important to this low income community, ensuring adolescent participation. Nevertheless, adolescents were obliged to fulfil cultural duties and roles that interfered with regular adherence to the iron supplementation regime.

Epub 2023 Jan 6.,Beltempo M,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,2023,2023/01/07,,,10.1136/archdischild-2022-324414,"OBJECTIVE: In a healthcare system with finite resources, hospital organisational factors may contribute to patient outcomes. We aimed to assess the association of nurse staffing and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) occupancy with outcomes of preterm infants born <33 weeks' gestation.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Four level III NICUs.
PATIENTS: Infants born 23-32 weeks' gestation 2015-2018.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nursing provision ratios (nursing hours worked/recommended nursing hours based on patient acuity categories) and unit occupancy rates were averaged for the first shift, 24 hours and 7 days of admission of each infant. Primary outcome was mortality/morbidity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe neurological injury, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and nosocomial infection). ORs for association of exposure with outcomes were estimated using generalised linear mixed models adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: Among 1870 included infants, 823 (44%) had mortality/morbidity. Median nursing provision ratio was 1.03 (IQR 0.89-1.22) and median unit occupancy was 89% (IQR 82-94). In the first 24 hours of admission, higher nursing provision ratio was associated with lower odds of mortality/morbidity (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98), and higher unit occupancy was associated with higher odds of mortality/morbidity (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36). In causal mediation analysis, nursing provision ratios mediated 47% of the association between occupancy and outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: NICU occupancy is associated with mortality/morbidity among very preterm infants and may reflect lack of adequate resources in periods of high activity. Interventions aimed at reducing occupancy and maintaining adequate resources need to be considered as strategies to improve patient outcomes."

METHODS: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines, 8 electronic databases were searched for studies on predictive models and OUD, overdose, or persistent use in adults until June 25, 2023. Study selection and data extraction were completed independently by 2 reviewers. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed independently by 2 reviewers using the Prediction model Risk of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST).
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 3130 reports; after removing 199 duplicates, excluding 2685 studies after abstract review, and excluding 204 studies after full-text review, the final sample consisted of 41 studies that developed more than 160 predictive models. Primary outcomes included opioid overdose (31.6% of studies), OUD (41.4%), and persistent opioid use (17%). The most common modeling approach was regression modeling, and the most common predictors included age, sex, mental health diagnosis history, and substance use disorder history. Most studies reported model performance via the c statistic, ranging from 0.507 to 0.959; gradient boosting tree models and neural network models performed well in the context of their own study. One study deployed a model in real time. Risk of bias was predominantly high; concerns regarding applicability were predominantly low.
CONCLUSIONS: Models to predict opioid-related risks are developed using diverse data sources and predictors, with a wide and heterogenous range of accuracy metrics. There is a need for further research to improve their accuracy and implementation."

We aimed to develop a model to differentiate individuals with IPH from the normal population.
METHODS: Data from 54301 eligible participants were obtained from the Risk Evaluation of Cancers in Chinese Diabetic Individuals: a longitudinal (REACTION) study in China. Data from 37740 participants were used to develop the diagnostic system. External validation was performed among 16561 participants. Three machine learning algorithms were used to create the predictive models, which were further evaluated by various classification algorithms to establish the best predictive model.
RESULTS: Ten features were selected to develop an IPH diagnosis system (IPHDS) based on an artificial neural network. In external validation, the AUC of the IPHDS was 0.823 (95% CI 0.811-0.836), which was significantly higher than the AUC of the Taiwan model [0.799 (0.786-0.813)] and that of the Chinese Diabetes Risk Score model [0.648 (0.635-0.662)]. The IPHDS model had a sensitivity of 75.6% and a specificity of 74.6%. This model outperformed the Taiwan and CDRS models in subgroup analyses.

Additionally, this study sought to external validation of the CNN models in addition to the linear regression (LM), random forest (RF), and full connected neural network (FcNN) models published in Steenbocket al(2019J. Meas. Phys. Behav.294-102).Approach.Included in this study were 41 German children (3.0-6.99 years) for the training and internal validation who were equipped with GENEActiv, GT3X+, and activPAL accelerometers. The external validation dataset consisted of 39 Canadian children (3.0-5.99 years) that were equipped with OPAL, GT9X, GENEActiv, and GT3X+ accelerometers. EE was recorded simultaneously in both datasets using a portable metabolic unit. The protocols consisted of a semi-structured activities ranging from low to high intensities. The root mean square error (RMSE) values were calculated and used to evaluate model performances.Main results.(1) The CNNs outperformed the LM (13.17%-23.81% lower mean RMSE values), FcNN (8.13%-27.27% lower RMSE values) and the RF models (3.59%-18.84% lower RMSE values) in the internal dataset. (2) In contrast, it was found that when applied to the external Canadian dataset, the CNN models had consistently higher RMSE values compared to the LM, FcNN, and RF.Significance.Although CNNs can enhance EE prediction accuracy, their ability to generalize to new datasets and accelerometer brands/models, is more limited compared to LM, RF, and FcNN models."

To generate and to share accurate and independent data with the global community requires multisite prospective diagnostic evaluations of Ag-RDTs. This report describes the clinical evaluation of the OnSite COVID-19 rapid test (CTK Biotech, CA, USA) in Brazil and the United Kingdom. A total of 496 paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected from symptomatic health care workers at Hospital das Clínicas in São Paulo, Brazil, and 211 NP swabs were collected from symptomatic participants at a COVID-19 drive-through testing site in Liverpool, United Kingdom. Swabs were analyzed by Ag-RDT, and results were compared to quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR). The clinical sensitivity of the OnSite COVID-19 rapid test in Brazil was 90.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.1 to 96.7%) and in the United Kingdom was 75.3% (95% CI, 64.6 to 83.6%). The clinical specificity in Brazil was 99.4% (95% CI, 98.1 to 99.8%) and in the United Kingdom was 95.5% (95% CI, 90.6 to 97.9%). Concurrently, analytical evaluation of the Ag-RDT was assessed using direct culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2 strains from wild-type (WT), Alpha, Delta, Gamma, and Omicron lineages. This study provides comparative performance of an Ag-RDT across two different settings, geographical areas, and populations. Overall, the OnSite Ag-RDT demonstrated a lower clinical sensitivity than claimed by the manufacturer. The sensitivity and specificity from the Brazil study fulfilled the performance criteria determined by the World Health Organization, but the performance obtained from the UK study failed to do. Further evaluation of Ag-RDTs should include harmonized protocols between laboratories to facilitate comparison between settings. IMPORTANCE Evaluating rapid diagnostic tests in diverse populations is essential to improving diagnostic responses as it gives an indication of the accuracy in real-world scenarios. In the case of rapid diagnostic testing within this pandemic, lateral flow tests that meet the minimum requirements for sensitivity and specificity can play a key role in increasing testing capacity, allowing timely clinical management of those infected, and protecting health care systems. This is particularly valuable in settings where access to the test gold standard is often restricted."

DESIGN: National, population-representative, retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive care units participating in the Canadian Neonatal Network.
POPULATION: All infants born at 230/7 -336/7 weeks of gestation (n = 43 456).
METHODS: We estimated the associations between exposure to ACS and neonatal outcomes by year of birth. Year of birth was considered both continuously and categorically as three consecutive epochs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neonatal mortality and severe neurological injury.
RESULTS: The absolute rates of neonatal mortality and severe neurological injury decreased during the study period in both the ACS and No ACS groups. For infants born at 230/7 -306/7 weeks of gestation, ACS was associated with similar reductions in neonatal mortality across the three epochs (9.0% versus 18.1%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.47-0.61 in 2003-09; 7.6% versus 19.6%, aRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44-0.59 in 2010-13; and 7.3% versus 14.5%, aRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46-0.68 in 2014-17) and in severe neurological injury (13.2% versus 25.8%, aRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.50-0.64 in 2003-09; 7.4% versus 17.4%, aRR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.66 in 2010-14; and 7.2% versus 14.8%, aRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.74 in 2014-17).
CONCLUSION: Despite the ongoing improvements in neonatal care of preterm infants, as reflected by the gradual decrease in the absolute rates of neonatal mortality and severe neurological injury, the association of ACS treatment with neonatal mortality and severe neurological injury among extremely preterm infants born at 23-30 weeks of gestation has remained stable throughout the study period of 15 years.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Despite the gradual decrease in the rates of neonatal mortality and severe neurological injury, antenatal corticosteroids remain an important intervention in the current era of neonatal care."

This study aimed to develop and validate a new WHO glass bottle bioassay method as an alternative to the WHO standard insecticide tube test to monitor mosquito susceptibility to new public health insecticides with particular modes of action, physical properties or both.
METHODS: A multi-centre study involving 21 laboratories worldwide generated data on the susceptibility of seven mosquito species (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto [An. gambiae s.s.], Anopheles funestus, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles minimus and Anopheles albimanus) to seven public health insecticides in five classes, including pyrethroids (metofluthrin, prallethrin and transfluthrin), neonicotinoids (clothianidin), pyrroles (chlorfenapyr), juvenile hormone mimics (pyriproxyfen) and butenolides (flupyradifurone), in glass bottle assays. The data were analysed using a Bayesian binomial model to determine the concentration-response curves for each insecticide-species combination and to assess the within-bioassay variability in the susceptibility endpoints, namely the concentration that kills 50% and 99% of the test population (LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>99</sub>, respectively) and the concentration that inhibits oviposition of the test population by 50% and 99% (OI<sub>50</sub> and OI<sub>99</sub>), to measure mortality and the sterilizing effect, respectively.
RESULTS: Overall, about 200,000 mosquitoes were tested with the new bottle bioassay, and LC<sub>50</sub>/LC<sub>99</sub> or OI<sub>50</sub>/OI<sub>99</sub> values were determined for all insecticides. Variation was seen between laboratories in estimates for some mosquito species-insecticide combinations, while other test results were consistent. The variation was generally greater with transfluthrin and flupyradifurone than with the other compounds tested, especially against Anopheles species. Overall, the mean within-bioassay variability in mortality and oviposition inhibition were &lt; 10% for most mosquito species-insecticide combinations.
CONCLUSION: Our findings, based on the largest susceptibility dataset ever produced on mosquitoes, showed that the new WHO bottle bioassay is adequate for evaluating mosquito susceptibility to new and promising public health insecticides currently deployed for vector control. The datasets presented in this study have been used recently by the WHO to establish 17 new insecticide discriminating concentrations (DCs) for either Aedes spp. or Anopheles spp. The bottle bioassay and DCs can now be widely used to monitor baseline insecticide susceptibility of wild populations of vectors of malaria and Aedes-borne diseases worldwide."

STUDY DESIGN: Data were extracted for babies admitted from 2014 to 2016 and born at 24 to 28 weeks of gestational age (n = 28 204). Median LOS was calculated for each network for babies who survived and those who died while in neonatal care. A linear regression model was used to investigate differences in LOS between networks after adjusting for gestational age, birth weight z score, sex, and multiplicity. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for babies who were discharged home directly.
RESULTS: Observed median LOS for babies who survived was longest in Japan (107 days); this result persisted after adjustment (20.7 days more than reference, 95% CI 19.3-22.1). Finland had the shortest adjusted LOS (-4.8 days less than reference, 95% CI -7.3 to -2.3). For each week's increase in gestational age at birth, LOS decreased by 12.1 days (95% CI -12.3 to -11.9). Multiplicity and male sex predicted mean increases in LOS of 2.6 (95% CI 2.0-3.2) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.6-2.6) days, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified between-network differences in LOS of up to 3 weeks for babies born extremely preterm. Some of these may be partly explained by differences in mortality, but unexplained variations also may be related to differences in clinical care practices and healthcare systems between countries."

The aim of this study was to determine the factors related to unintentional burns in children, using data mining algorithms. In this hospital-based case-control study conducted in Kermanshah province, Iran, data were collected over a period of 15 months. Children under the age of 15 years old who were referred to the burn ward of Imam Khomeini Hospital, the only burn referral in Kermanshah province, were included as cases. For the control group, children who were admitted to Dr. Mohammad Kermanshahi Hospital, the only specialist and subspecialist pediatric center in this province, were included. Frequency matching was performed for age and sex. Support vector machine, artificial neural network (ANN), random forest, and logistic regression were employed to determine the factors related to burns in children. The mean age of children with burn injuries was 4.29 ± 3.51 years and 58% of them were boys. The ANN algorithm had better performance than other algorithms. Body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, hours without a watchful, mother's age, mother's education, household size, father's job, father's age, having more than one watchful, and petroleum storage were the most important factors related to pediatric burns. The majority of the burn-related variables were related to individuals' social welfare status and their environments. Lessening the effects of these factors could reduce the incidence of pediatric burns."

We sought to determine the clinical utility of the algorithms compared with our clinical decision making and outcomes for management of rAAA during a 10-year period.
METHODS: Patients admitted with a diagnosis rAAA at a large university hospital were identified from 2005 to 2014. The Glasgow Aneurysm Score, Hardman Index, Vancouver Score, Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score, University of Washington Ruptured Aneurysm Score, Vascular Study Group of New England rAAA Risk Score, and the Artificial Neural Network Score were analyzed for accuracy in predicting mortality. Among patients quantified into the highest-risk group (predicted mortality >80%-85%), we compared the predicted with the actual outcome to determine how well these scores predicted futility.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 64 patients. Of those, 24 (38%) underwent open repair, 36 (56%) underwent endovascular repair, and 4 (6%) received only comfort care. Overall mortality was 30% (open repair, 26%; endovascular repair, 24%; no repair, 100%). As assessed by the scoring systems, 5% to 35% of patients were categorized as high-mortality risk. Intersystem agreement was poor, with κ values ranging from 0.06 to 0.79. Actual mortality was lower than the predicted mortality (50%-70% vs 78%-100%) for all scoring systems, with each scoring system overestimating mortality by 10% to 50%. Mortality rates for patients not designated into the high-risk cohort were dramatically lower, ranging from 7% to 29%. Futility, defined as 100% mortality, was predicted in five of 63 patients with the Hardman Index and in two of 63 of the University of Washington score. Of these, surgery was not offered to one of five and one of two patients, respectively. If one of these two models were used to withhold operative intervention, the mortality of these patients would have been 100%. The actual mortality for these patients was 60% and 50%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical algorithms for predicting mortality after rAAA were not useful for predicting futility. Most patients with rAAA were not classified in the highest-risk group by the clinical decision models. Among patients identified as highest risk, predicted mortality was overestimated compared with actual mortality. The data from this study support the limited value to surgeons of the currently published algorithms."

We analyzed a multicenter cohort that included several features typically used to determine an individual's level of frailty. We present a clustering based phenotyping approach, where we investigated two clustering approaches-i.e. neural network based Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with hierarchical clustering, and KAMILA (KAy-means for MIxed LArge data sets). Our clustering results partition the individuals across 3 distinct clusters. Clusters were used to generate and study feature-level phenotypes of each group."

Effectively managing TB requires early identification of individuals with TB disease. Resource-constrained settings often lack skilled professionals for interpreting chest X-rays (CXRs) used in TB diagnosis. To address this challenge, we developed ""DecXpert"" a novel Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) software solution based on deep neural networks for early TB diagnosis from CXRs, aiming to detect subtle abnormalities that may be overlooked by human interpretation alone. This study was conducted on the largest cohort size to date, where the performance of a CAD software (DecXpert version 1.4) was validated against the gold standard molecular diagnostic technique, GeneXpert MTB/RIF, analyzing data from 4363 individuals across 12 primary health care centers and one tertiary hospital in North India. DecXpert demonstrated 88% sensitivity (95% CI 0.85-0.93) and 85% specificity (95% CI 0.82-0.91) for active TB detection. Incorporating demographics, DecXpert achieved an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), indicating robust diagnostic performance. Our findings establish DecXpert's potential as an accurate, efficient AI solution for early identification of active TB cases. Deployed as a screening tool in resource-limited settings, DecXpert could enable early identification of individuals with TB disease and facilitate effective TB management where skilled radiological interpretation is limited."

This study aimed to predict survival outcomes of CRC patients using machine learning (ML) methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 1853 CRC patients admitted to three prominent tertiary hospitals in Iran from October 2006 to July 2019. Six ML methods, namely logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree (DT), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), were developed with 10-fold cross-validation. Feature selection employed the Random Forest method based on mean decrease GINI criteria. Model performance was assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Time from diagnosis, age, tumor size, metastatic status, lymph node involvement, and treatment type emerged as crucial predictors of survival based on mean decrease GINI. The NB (AUC = 0.70, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.65-0.75) and LGBM (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.75) models achieved the highest predictive AUC values for CRC patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significance of variables including time from diagnosis, age, tumor size, metastatic status, lymph node involvement, and treatment type in predicting CRC survival. The NB model exhibited optimal efficacy in mortality prediction, maintaining a balanced sensitivity and specificity. Policy recommendations encompass early diagnosis and treatment initiation for CRC patients, improved data collection through digital health records and standardized protocols, support for predictive analytics integration in clinical decisions, and the inclusion of identified prognostic variables in treatment guidelines to enhance patient outcomes."

While many scholars have primarily focused on the influence of public health events from the perspective of disease prevention and control, research examining their economic implications, especially regarding public health indices in the securities market, remains relatively scarce. Such studies are crucial for ensuring public health safety and stability. This paper employs the Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (Bayes-CNN) model to predict financial market volatility influenced by public health events and conducts a comparative analysis. To validate the feasibility of this method, the model is used to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the CSI (China Securities Index) Medical Service Index. The results indicate significant differences in the volatility of the CSI Medical Service Index before and after the outbreak, particularly during the pandemic period. This study also enhances the validity and reliability of its conclusions by incorporating European data and employing the GARCH model. Relevant institutions and individual investors should adopt different regulatory and investment strategies based on the specifics of various public health events to prevent the outbreak of systemic financial risks that could affect social stability. This paper offers a new perspective and methodology for predicting financial market volatility under the influence of public health events, providing valuable insights for investors and decision-makers to better understand and respond to the potential impacts of such events on financial markets."

We evaluated the effects of REBOA on carotid blood flow (Qcarotid) in a porcine model of massive hemorrhage. We hypothesized that REBOA restores Qcarotid faster than reinfusion of blood.
METHODS: Spontaneously breathing sedated Sinclair pigs underwent exponential hemorrhage of 65% total blood volume in 1 hour. They were randomized into three groups. Positive control (PC, n = 7) underwent immediate transfusion of shed blood. REBOA (n = 21) received a novel 7 Fr ER-REBOA catheter (Pryor Medical, Arvada, CO) placed into aortic Zone 1 via a femoral artery introducer for 30 minutes or 60 minutes, with transfusion either after deflation or midway through inflation. Negative control (n = 7) received no resuscitation. Qcarotid was recorded continuously using an ultrasonic flow probe. Survival and time between Qcarotid, min and both a stable maximal value (Qcarotid, max) and restoration of baseline flow (Qcarotid, new BL) were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Median time to Qcarotid, max was 3.0 minutes in the REBOA group versus 9.6 minutes in the control group (p = 0.006). Median time to Qcarotid, new BL was 6.0 minutes in the REBOA group versus 20.5 minutes in the PC group (p = 0.11). Slope of the linear regression between Qcarotid, min and Qcarotid, new BL was 16.7 in REBOA and 10.4 in PC (p = 0.31). Four-hour survival was 95% (20 of 21) in the REBOA group versus 71% (5 of 7) in the PC group (p = 0.06) and 0% in the negative control group.
CONCLUSION: REBOA resulted in the restoration of Qcarotid (""cerebrovascular resuscitation"") at least as rapidly as retransfusion of shed blood, with equivalent 4-hour survival. Further studies of REBOA, to include mitigation of end-organ effects and longer follow-up, are needed."

The predictive power of machine learning methods in predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors was explored using box plots to summarize the distribution of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values by machine learning method and suicide outcome (i.e., suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt, and death by suicide). Mean AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for each suicide outcome by study design, data source, total sample size, sample size of cases, and machine learning methods employed. The most important risk factors were listed.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified 2,200 unique records, of which 104 articles met the inclusion criteria. Machine learning algorithms achieved good prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (i.e., an AUC between 0.80 and 0.89); however, their predictive power appears to differ across suicide outcomes. The boosting algorithms achieved good prediction of suicidal thoughts, death by suicide, and all suicide outcomes combined, while neural network algorithms achieved good prediction of suicide attempts. The risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors differed depending on the data source and the population under study.
CONCLUSION: The predictive utility of machine learning for suicidal thoughts and behaviors largely depends on the approach used. The findings of the current review should prove helpful in preparing future machine learning models using administrative and survey data.

30138770,Design and experiment verification of a novel analysis framework for recognition of driver injury patterns: From a multi-class classification perspective,"Zhu M, Li Y, Wang Y.",Accid Anal Prev. 2018 Nov;120:152-164. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2018.08.011. Epub 2018 Aug 20.,Zhu M,Accid Anal Prev,2018,2018/08/24,,,10.1016/j.aap.2018.08.011,"Detecting driver injury patterns is a typical classification problem. Crash data sets are highly skewed where fatalities and severe injuries are often less represented compared to other events. The severity prediction performance of the existing models is poor due to the highly imbalanced samples of different severity levels within a given dataset. This paper proposes a machine learning based analysis framework from a multi-class classification perspective for accurate recognition of the driver injury patterns. The proposed framework includes preprocessing, classification, evaluation and application of a given dataset. This framework is verified based on the three years single-vehicle ROR (run-off-road) crash records collected in Washington State from 2011 to 2013. At first, thirteen most important safety-related variables are recognized through random forests. Then, the four driver's injury severity levels viz., fatal/serious injury, evident injury, possible injury, and no injury are predicted by integrating the decomposed binary neural network models to achieve better performance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to interpret variables' impacts on the decomposed injury severity levels. The study shows that lack of restraint, female drivers, truck usage, driver impairment, driver distraction, vehicle overturn (rollover), dawn/dusk, and overtaking are the leading factors contributing to the driver fatalities or severe injuries in a single-vehicle ROR crash. Most of the findings are consistent with the previous studies. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which can be further applied for pattern recognition in traffic safety research."
33618655,A scoping review of studies using observational data to optimise dynamic treatment regimens,"Mahar RK, McGuinness MB, Chakraborty B, Carlin JB, IJzerman MJ, Simpson JA.",BMC Med Res Methodol. 2021 Feb 22;21(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s12874-021-01211-2.,Mahar RK,BMC Med Res Methodol,2021,2021/02/23,PMC7898728,,10.1186/s12874-021-01211-2,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) formalise the multi-stage and dynamic decision problems that clinicians often face when treating chronic or progressive medical conditions. Compared to randomised controlled trials, using observational data to optimise DTRs may allow a wider range of treatments to be evaluated at a lower cost. This review aimed to provide an overview of how DTRs are optimised with observational data in practice.
METHODS: Using the PubMed database, a scoping review of studies in which DTRs were optimised using observational data was performed in October 2020. Data extracted from eligible articles included target medical condition, source and type of data, statistical methods, and translational relevance of the included studies.
RESULTS: From 209 PubMed abstracts, 37 full-text articles were identified, and a further 26 were screened from the reference lists, totalling 63 articles for inclusion in a narrative data synthesis. Observational DTR models are a recent development and their application has been concentrated in a few medical areas, primarily HIV/AIDS (27, 43%), followed by cancer (8, 13%), and diabetes (6, 10%). There was substantial variation in the scope, intent, complexity, and quality between the included studies. Statistical methods that were used included inverse-probability weighting (26, 41%), the parametric G-formula (16, 25%), Q-learning (10, 16%), G-estimation (4, 6%), targeted maximum likelihood/minimum loss-based estimation (4, 6%), regret regression (3, 5%), and other less common approaches (10, 16%). Notably, studies that were primarily intended to address real-world clinical questions (18, 29%) tended to use inverse-probability weighting and the parametric G-formula, relatively well-established methods, along with a large amount of data. Studies focused on methodological developments (45, 71%) tended to be more complicated and included a demonstrative real-world application only.
CONCLUSIONS: As chronic and progressive conditions become more common, the need will grow for personalised treatments and methods to estimate the effects of DTRs. Observational DTR studies will be necessary, but so far their use to inform clinical practice has been limited. Focusing on simple DTRs, collecting large and rich clinical datasets, and fostering tight partnerships between content experts and data analysts may result in more clinically relevant observational DTR studies."

Epub 2018 Oct 22.,Myles D,Eur J Neurosci,2019,2018/10/03,,,10.1111/ejn.14191,"Video slot machines are associated with both accelerated transition into problematic forms of gambling, as well as psychosocial harm above and beyond other forms of gambling. A growing body of evidence is uncovering how key design features of multiline slot machines produce an inflated experience of reward, despite the fact that these features offer no overall financial benefit to the player. A pernicious example of this are 'losses disguised as wins' (LDWs), which occur when simultaneous bets placed on multiple lines result in a winning combination that returns an amount greater than zero, but less the total wager. These events are usually accompanied by the same celebratory sounds and animations that accompany true wins. We argue that LDWs may leverage neuropsychological phenomena that underlie reinforcement learning and contribute to extended or repetitive use and gambling-related harm. While other characteristics of slot machine gambling have been examined by cognitive neuroscientists, this feature has not yet received attention. Neuroscientific methods can be used to assess the impact of LDWs on the human reward system, to assess the claim that these events are a reinforcing and contributing factor in the development of harmful play. Positive findings would provide further persuasive evidence in support of strategies to minimise gambling harm through the regulation of machine design."
38012221,Causal inference using observational intensive care unit data: a scoping review and recommendations for future practice,"Smit JM, Krijthe JH, Kant WMR, Labrecque JA, Komorowski M, Gommers DAMPJ, van Bommel J, Reinders MJT, van Genderen ME.",NPJ Digit Med. 2023 Nov 27;6(1):221. doi: 10.1038/s41746-023-00961-1.,Smit JM,NPJ Digit Med,2023,2023/11/27,PMC10682453,,10.1038/s41746-023-00961-1,"This scoping review focuses on the essential role of models for causal inference in shaping actionable artificial intelligence (AI) designed to aid clinicians in decision-making. The objective was to identify and evaluate the reporting quality of studies introducing models for causal inference in intensive care units (ICUs), and to provide recommendations to improve the future landscape of research practices in this domain. To achieve this, we searched various databases including Embase, MEDLINE ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and the ACM Digital Library. Studies involving models for causal inference addressing time-varying treatments in the adult ICU were reviewed. Data extraction encompassed the study settings and methodologies applied. Furthermore, we assessed reporting quality of target trial components (i.e., eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, follow-up period, outcome, and analysis plan) and main causal assumptions (i.e., conditional exchangeability, positivity, and consistency). Among the 2184 titles screened, 79 studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodologies used were G methods (61%) and reinforcement learning methods (39%). Studies considered both static (51%) and dynamic treatment regimes (49%). Only 30 (38%) of the studies reported all five target trial components, and only seven (9%) studies mentioned all three causal assumptions. To achieve actionable AI in the ICU, we advocate careful consideration of the causal question of interest, describing this research question as a target trial emulation, usage of appropriate causal inference methods, and acknowledgement (and examination of potential violations of) the causal assumptions."

METHODS: A patient-oriented Markov decision process model was designed to compare, for a given patient with 1 living donor, living-donor-first followed if necessary by deceased donor retransplantation versus deceased-donor-first followed if necessary by living donor (if still able to donate) or deceased donor (if not) retransplantation. Based on Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, the model was designed to account for waitlist, graft, and patient survival, sensitization, increased risk of graft failure seen during late adolescence, and differential deceased donor waiting times based on pediatric priority allocation policies. Based on national cohort data, the model was also designed to account for aging or disease development, leading to ineligibility of the living donor over time.
RESULTS: Given a set of candidate and living donor characteristics, the Markov model provides the expected patient survival over a time horizon of 20 years. For the most highly sensitized patients (panel reactive antibody > 80%), a deceased-donor-first strategy was advantageous, but for all other patients (panel reactive antibody < 80%), a living-donor-first strategy was recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: This Markov model illustrates how patients, families, and providers can be provided information and predictions regarding the most advantageous use of deceased donor versus living donor transplantation for pediatric recipients."

METHODS: The study analyzed the cost effectiveness by developing an analysis of the Markov decision process from the perspective of the National Health System. The strategies compared reflect upon the adoption of genetic testing and preventative strategies for relatives or the usual care currently proposed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed in terms of cost per case avoided. The sensitivity analysis was performed in a univariate and deterministic manner.
RESULTS: The study showed increments for effectiveness and for costs when performing genetic testing and adopting prophylactic measures for family members. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at R$908.58 per case of cancer avoided, a figure considered lower than the study's cost-effectiveness threshold (R$7,543.50).
CONCLUSIONS: The program analyzed should be considered a cost-effective strategy for the national situation. Studies in various other countries have reached similar conclusions. One possible ramification of this research might the need to perform a budgetary-impact analysis of making the program one of the country's health policies."
39350046,"A simulated trial with reinforcement learning for the efficacy of Irinotecan and Ifosfamide versus Topotecan in relapsed, extensive stage small cell lung cancer","Bozcuk HŞ, Artaç M.",BMC Cancer. 2024 Sep 30;24(1):1207. doi: 10.1186/s12885-024-12985-1.,Bozcuk HŞ,BMC Cancer,2024,2024/09/30,PMC11440650,,10.1186/s12885-024-12985-1,"OBJECTIVES: Synthetic data may proxy clinical data. At the absence of direct clinical data, this study aimed to compare Irinotecan and Ifosfamide (II) with Topotecan in synthetic, recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients within a simulated clinical trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two simulation stages were conducted. Initially, 200 recurrent SCLC cases were simulated to replicate a previous phase 3 trial, testing the utility of Cox proportional hazards model and simulation methodology together, where patients were randomized to receive Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine (CAV) or Topotecan. In the second stage, 600 recurrent SCLC patients were simulated and randomized to compare Topotecan versus II in terms of overall survival (OAS), using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: CAV versus Topotecan comparison showed no statistical difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR): 0.89, 95% CI: 0.67-1.18, P = 0.418), aligning with the original clinical trial. For the Topotecan versus II comparison, the RL framework significantly favored the II arm (mean reward points: 193.43 versus - 251.82, permutation P < 0.0001). Likewise, II arm exhibited superior median OAS compared to Topotecan arm (11.12 versus 6.30 months). HR was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.38-0.52) with P < 0.0001, in favor of II.
CONCLUSION: Artificial trial results for CAV versus Topotecan matched the original trial, confirming indifference of OAS. Additionally, II yielded superior overall survival compared to Topotecan in recurrent SCLC patients. These demonstrate the potential of RL and simulation in conjunction with Cox modelling for similar studies. However, definitive conclusions necessitate a randomized clinical trial between II and Topotecan in this patient cohort."

This makes it difficult to perform comparative studies of categorization using non-human animals. Interpretation of comparative studies is further complicated by the possibility that animal performance may merely reflect reinforcement learning, whereby discrete features act as discriminative cues for categorization. To assess and compare how humans and monkeys classified visual stimuli, we trained 7 rhesus macaques and 41 human volunteers to respond, in a specific order, to four simultaneously presented stimuli at a time, each belonging to a different perceptual category. These exemplars were drawn at random from large banks of images, such that the stimuli presented changed on every trial. Subjects nevertheless identified and ordered these changing stimuli correctly. Three monkeys learned to order naturalistic photographs; four others, close-up sections of paintings with distinctive styles. Humans learned to order both types of stimuli. All subjects classified stimuli at levels substantially greater than that predicted by chance or by feature-driven learning alone, even when stimuli changed on every trial. However, humans more closely resembled monkeys when classifying the more abstract painting stimuli than the photographic stimuli. This points to a common classification strategy in both species, one that humans can rely on in the absence of linguistic labels for categories."

Choice data in decision-making tasks are inherently noisy, and separating noise from signal can improve the quality of computational modeling. Common approaches to model decision noise often assume constant levels of noise or exploration throughout learning (e.g., the ϵ-softmax policy). However, this assumption is not guaranteed to hold - for example, a subject might disengage and lapse into an inattentive phase for a series of trials in the middle of otherwise low-noise performance. Here, we introduce a new, computationally inexpensive method to dynamically infer the levels of noise in choice behavior, under a model assumption that agents can transition between two discrete latent states (e.g., fully engaged and random). Using simulations, we show that modeling noise levels dynamically instead of statically can substantially improve model fit and parameter estimation, especially in the presence of long periods of noisy behavior, such as prolonged attentional lapses. We further demonstrate the empirical benefits of dynamic noise estimation at the individual and group levels by validating it on four published datasets featuring diverse populations, tasks, and models. Based on the theoretical and empirical evaluation of the method reported in the current work, we expect that dynamic noise estimation will improve modeling in many decision-making paradigms over the static noise estimation method currently used in the modeling literature, while keeping additional model complexity and assumptions minimal."

Epub 2024 Apr 17.,Malamud J,Psychol Med,2024,2024/04/17,,,10.1017/S0033291724000837,"BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line pharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about how pharmacological action is related to cognitive and affective processes. Here, we examine whether specific reinforcement learning processes mediate the treatment effects of SSRIs.
METHODS: The PANDA trial was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in UK primary care comparing the SSRI sertraline with placebo for depression and anxiety. Participants (N = 655) performed an affective Go/NoGo task three times during the trial and computational models were used to infer reinforcement learning processes.
RESULTS: There was poor task performance: only 54% of the task runs were informative, with more informative task runs in the placebo than in the active group. There was no evidence for the preregistered hypothesis that Pavlovian inhibition was affected by sertraline. Exploratory analyses revealed that in the sertraline group, early increases in Pavlovian inhibition were associated with improvements in depression after 12 weeks. Furthermore, sertraline increased how fast participants learned from losses and faster learning from losses was associated with more severe generalized anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate a relationship between aversive reinforcement learning mechanisms and aspects of depression, anxiety, and SSRI treatment, but these relationships did not align with the initial hypotheses. Poor task performance limits the interpretability and likely generalizability of the findings, and highlights the critical importance of developing acceptable and reliable tasks for use in clinical studies.

ALL evolves in two discrete steps. First, in utero initiation by fusion gene formation or hyperdiploidy generates a covert, pre-leukaemic clone. Second, in a small fraction of these cases, the postnatal acquisition of secondary genetic changes (primarily V(D)J recombination-activating protein (RAG) and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-driven copy number alterations in the case of ETS translocation variant 6 (ETV6)-runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)+ ALL) drives conversion to overt leukaemia. Epidemiological and modelling studies endorse a dual role for common infections. Microbial exposures earlier in life are protective but, in their absence, later infections trigger the critical secondary mutations. Risk is further modified by inherited genetics, chance and, probably, diet. Childhood ALL can be viewed as a paradoxical consequence of progress in modern societies, where behavioural changes have restrained early microbial exposure. This engenders an evolutionary mismatch between historical adaptations of the immune system and contemporary lifestyles. Childhood ALL may be a preventable cancer."

METHODS: In an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adult participants in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 viral particles) or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) with an onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration among participants in the per-protocol population who had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Safety was also assessed.
RESULTS: The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe-critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ≥14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ≥28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe-critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).
CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe-critical disease, including hospitalization and death.

Epub 2021 Feb 22.,Denmeade SR,J Clin Oncol,2021,2021/02/22,PMC8274807,,10.1200/JCO.20.02759,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PCa) becomes resistant to androgen ablation through adaptive upregulation of the androgen receptor in response to the low-testosterone microenvironment. Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), defined as rapid cycling between high and low serum testosterone, disrupts this adaptive regulation in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).
METHODS: The TRANSFORMER (Testosterone Revival Abolishes Negative Symptoms, Fosters Objective Response and Modulates Enzalutamide Resistance) study is a randomized study comparing monthly BAT (n = 94) with enzalutamide (n = 101). The primary end point was clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (PFS); crossover was permitted at progression. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and objective response rates, PFS from randomization through crossover (PFS2), safety, and quality of life (QoL).
RESULTS: The PFS was 5.7 months for both arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.55; P = .42). For BAT, 50% decline in PSA (PSA50) was 28.2% of patients versus 25.3% for enzalutamide. At crossover, PSA50 response occurred in 77.8% of patients crossing to enzalutamide and 23.4% to BAT. The PSA-PFS for enzalutamide increased from 3.8 months after abiraterone to 10.9 months after BAT. The PFS2 for BAT→enzalutamide was 28.2 versus 19.6 months for enzalutamide→BAT (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.88; P = .02). OS was 32.9 months for BAT versus 29.0 months for enzalutamide (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P = .80). OS was 37.1 months for patients crossing from BAT to enzalutamide versus 30.2 months for the opposite sequence (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.28; P = .225). BAT adverse events were primarily grade 1-2. Patient-reported QoL consistently favored BAT.
CONCLUSION: This randomized trial establishes meaningful clinical activity and safety of BAT and supports additional study to determine its optimal clinical integration. BAT can sensitize CRPC to subsequent antiandrogen therapy. Further study is required to confirm whether sequential therapy with BAT and enzalutamide can improve survival in men with CRPC."

A D. polylepis bite is a medical emergency and requires adequate action to prevent severe complications. However, there are no comprehensive reviews available based on clinical cases, and no readily accessible guidelines for standardized treatment. Therefore, we aim to provide an overview regarding the currently available clinical literature on D. polylepis envenomations; in order to promote knowledge on symptomatology and treatment options.
METHODS: We searched for cases reporting humans bitten by D. polylepis in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Sabinet. We searched the reference lists of all eligible articles for additional articles. After quality assessment, 29 cases were included in this review. We used descriptive analysis to create an overview of the collected parameters.
DISCUSSION: Among the included case reports and case series, D. polylepis envenomations most frequently resulted in decreased respiratory function, sweating and paralysis. The onset of symptoms usually occurred within 60 minutes. Neurological symptoms occurred more often than symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. In the reported cases most patients (26/29) received antivenom and most survived (25/29). We recommend the reporting of additional structured case reports to improve future analyses on the clinical course of envenomations, in order to improve public health response to D. polylepis envenomations."

Since its emergence in late 2021, Omicron has displaced other circulating variants and caused successive waves of infection worldwide throughout 2022. Omicron is characterised by the rapid emergence of many subvariants and high rates of infection in people with vaccine- and/or infection induced immunity. This review article will consolidate current knowledge regarding Omicron subvariants, the role of boosters, and future vaccine development.
METHOD: This narrative review is based on a literature search using PubMed. Search terms related to Omicron were used and priority was given to published peer-reviewed articles over pre-prints.
RESULTS: Studies indicate that vaccinations and boosters are important to reduce disease severity, hospitalisation, and death from Omicron. A variety of factors, such as differing host factors, circulating variants, and forces of infection, can influence the benefit of repeated booster administration. Next-generation bivalent vaccines have now been approved in some countries including Singapore and have demonstrated the ability to induce broad variant protection. Future third-generation vaccines involving mucosal vaccines and/or pan-sarbecovirus vaccines may provide broader and longer-lasting protection.
CONCLUSION: Due to current high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity, it is likely that rates of severe illness, hospitalisation, and death due to Omicron will continue to moderate. Nevertheless, the virus is ever-changing, and public health policies, especially those related to vaccinations, will also have to continually evolve and adapt as COVID-19 transitions to endemicity."

In Western societies, Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia has a distinct epidemiology peaking at 3 years old. Exposure to ionising radiation is an established hazard but it is difficult to gauge the precise risk of less than 100 mSv. Since 1983 significant leukaemia incidences have been reported among families residing near nuclear installations. The target cells (naïve neonatal lymphocytes) get exposed to multiple xenobiotic challenges and undergo extraordinary proliferation and physiological somatic genetic change. Population movements and ionising radiation are considered taking account of updated understanding of radiation biology, cancer cytogenetics and immunological diversity. Double Strand Breaks in DNA arise through metabolic generation of Reactive Oxygen Species, and nearly always are repaired; but mis-repairs can be oncogenic. Recombinant Activating Gene enzymes in rapidly dividing perinatal pre-B lymphocytes being primed for antibody diversity are targeted to Signal Sequences in the Immunoglobulin genes. off target pseudo-sequences may allow RAG enzymes to create autosomal DSBs which, when mis-repaired, become translocated oncogenes. Immunogens acting by chance at crucial stages may facilitate this. In such circumstances, oncogenic DSBs from ionising radiation are less likely to be significant."

It recommends 5 strategies, out of which preventive chemotherapy (PC) and intensified disease management were key to achieve targets. WHO estimated that globally, between 2012 and 2019, the number of persons affected by NTDs decreased from nearly 2.1 to 1.7 billion people. We analysed the situation of NTDs in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) in 2020 to assess the progress with the 2012-2020 roadmap and to identify gaps.
METHODS: We reviewed data repositories of national data sources for 2012 to 2019 including the Global Indicator Data Platform for Sustainable Development Goals, the Global Health Observatory data repository, the WHO PC databank, and the EMR data repository. We allocated countries a Red-Amber-Green (RAG) rating based on standardized criteria, on progress and current situation of each of 11 priority NTDs.
RESULTS: All 22 countries in EMR were affected by 1 or more autochthonous or imported NTDs. In 2019, WHO estimated that in EMR, 78 million people required interventions for NTDs, a 38% decline compared with 2012. Twelve of 22 countries needed priority public health action (i.e., red) for 1 or more NTD. Of these, Sudan needed priority public health action for 6 NTDs and Yemen for 5. Eleven countries also needed priority public health action for cutaneous leishmaniasis, and 5 countries for rabies and trachoma. Visceral leishmaniasis is on the increase in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.
CONCLUSION: Since the first roadmap of NTDs in 2012, the EMR has made a substantial progress. Nevertheless, many challenges remain in the prevention and control of NTDs. EMR needs a regional approach to control NTDs in countries most affected and a coordinated strategy to stop the continuing increase of cutaneous leishmaniasis and a possible resurgence of visceral leishmaniasis."

In the last few years, environmental viral metagenomics has grown significantly and has enabled the identification, diversity and entire genome sequencing of viruses in environmental and clinical samples extensively. Prior to the arrival of metagenomics, traditional molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, were mostly used to identify and classify enteric viral species in different environmental milieu. After the advent of metagenomics, more detailed reports have emerged about the important waterborne viruses identified in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface water. This paper provides a review of methods that have been used for the concentration, detection and identification of viral species from different environmental matrices. The review also takes into consideration where metagenomics has been explored in different African countries, as well as the limitations and challenges facing the approach. Procedures including sample processing, experimental design, sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis are discussed. The review concludes by summarising the current thinking and practices in the field and lays bare key issues that those venturing into this field need to consider and address."

It is critical to understand whether the incidence of bystander CPR in witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests at home and in public settings differs according to the race or ethnic group of the person with cardiac arrest in order to inform interventions.
METHODS: Within a large U.S. registry, we identified 110,054 witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the period from 2013 through 2019. We used a hierarchical logistic regression model to analyze the incidence of bystander CPR in Black or Hispanic persons as compared with White persons with witnessed cardiac arrests at home and in public locations. We analyzed the overall incidence as well as the incidence according to neighborhood racial or ethnic makeup and income strata. Neighborhoods were classified as predominantly White (>80% of residents), majority Black or Hispanic (>50% of residents), or integrated, and as high income (an annual median household income of >$80,000), middle income ($40,000-$80,000), or low income (<$40,000).
RESULTS: Overall, 35,469 of the witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (32.2%) occurred in Black or Hispanic persons. Black and Hispanic persons were less likely to receive bystander CPR at home (38.5%) than White persons (47.4%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.76) and less likely to receive bystander CPR in public locations than White persons (45.6% vs. 60.0%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.66). The incidence of bystander CPR among Black and Hispanic persons was less than that among White persons not only in predominantly White neighborhoods at home (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.90) and in public locations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.75) but also in majority Black or Hispanic neighborhoods at home (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.83) and in public locations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.68) and in integrated neighborhoods at home (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81) and in public locations (adjusted odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.77). Similarly, across all neighborhood income strata, the frequency of bystander CPR at home and in public locations was lower among Black and Hispanic persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest than among White persons.
CONCLUSIONS: In witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, Black and Hispanic persons were less likely than White persons to receive potentially lifesaving bystander CPR at home and in public locations, regardless of the racial or ethnic makeup or income level of the neighborhood where the cardiac arrest occurred.

Children engage in waste management through various channels while constantly working to create a healthier and cleaner environment and exposing themselves to numerous health risks. Thus, this scoping review aims to explore the occupational injuries, health hazards, and sufferings of child waste workers in South Asia.
METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a scoping review of available relevant scientific literature was completed to comprehensively analyze the extent of child waste workers' health suffering. Online databases PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were searched for predefined criteria. Collected references were screened with Rayyan web tools and Endnote. Based on study inclusion criteria, a thematic synthesis was performed on the findings of 12 articles.
RESULTS: This study's findings provided deep insights into the most prevalent occupational health sufferings among child waste workers, as depicted in the available literature. Prevalence of injuries like cuts and wounds was found predominant. These injuries are caused by the collection, transportation, dumping, and recycling of waste. Respiratory, musculoskeletal, and skin diseases are more prevalent among child waste worker children than in control groups of the same socioeconomic backgrounds. A higher chance of genetic or neuro-degenerative disorder and DNA mutation indicates a long-term effect on the children working in the waste management sector. Psychological sufferings were the least explored, although very common among child laborers. MPD (Minor Psychiatric Disorder) was very high among waste workers. Regarding healthcare-seeking behavior, traditional methods are preferable rather than formal health facilities. More research is required in this area due to a lack of evidence on the health problems of child waste workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Occupational hazards were myriad among child waste workers. Though many children are involved in waste management, they are typically excluded from mainstream child protection and support systems, making them more exposed to occupational harassment and injury. Policymakers should design specific programs for these vulnerable groups considering the issues below, i.e., provide protective equipment such as facemasks, gloves, footwear, and rag sorting tools to safeguard them from physical damage and illness, ensure access to health care, to school, and provide basic nutrients to them. Furthermore, the authorities should think of alternative income generating programs for these groups of children."

METHODS: We conducted the final analysis in the double-blind phase of our multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, in which adults were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5×1010 viral particles) or placebo. The primary end points were vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration and at least 28 days after administration in the per-protocol population. Safety and key secondary and exploratory end points were also assessed.
RESULTS: Median follow-up in this analysis was 4 months; 8940 participants had at least 6 months of follow-up. In the per-protocol population (39,185 participants), vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19 at least 14 days after administration was 56.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.3 to 60.8; 484 cases in the vaccine group vs. 1067 in the placebo group); at least 28 days after administration, vaccine efficacy was 52.9% (95% CI, 47.1 to 58.1; 433 cases in the vaccine group vs. 883 in the placebo group). Efficacy in the United States, primarily against the reference strain (B.1.D614G) and the B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant, was 69.7% (95% CI, 60.7 to 76.9); efficacy was reduced elsewhere against the P.1 (gamma), C.37 (lambda), and B.1.621 (mu) variants. Efficacy was 74.6% (95% CI, 64.7 to 82.1) against severe-critical Covid-19 (with only 4 severe-critical cases caused by the B.1.617.2 [delta] variant), 75.6% (95% CI, 54.3 to 88.0) against Covid-19 leading to medical intervention (including hospitalization), and 82.8% (95% CI, 40.5 to 96.8) against Covid-19-related death, with protection lasting 6 months or longer. Efficacy against any severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was 41.7% (95% CI, 36.3 to 46.7). Ad26.COV2.S was associated with mainly mild-to-moderate adverse events, and no new safety concerns were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S provided 52.9% protection against moderate to severe-critical Covid-19. Protection varied according to variant; higher protection was observed against severe Covid-19, medical intervention, and death than against other end points and lasted for 6 months or longer.

Across species evolution, some transposases are tamed by their host and are made part of complex cellular systems. The proliferation of retroviruses is also dependent on transposase related enzymes termed integrases. Recombination‑activating gene protein (RAG)1 and metnase are just two examples of transposase domestication and together with retroviral integrases (INs), they belong to the DDE polynucleotidyl transferases superfamily. They share mechanistic and structural features linked to the RNase H‑like fold, harboring a DDE(D) metal dependent catalytic motif. Recent antiretroviral compounds target the catalytic domain of integrase, but they also have the potential of inhibiting other related enzymes. In this review, we report the activity of different classes of integrase inhibitors on various DDE transposases. Computational simulations are useful to predict the extent of off‑target activity and have been employed to study the interactions between RAG1 recombinase and compounds from three different pharmacologic classes. We demonstrate that strand‑transfer inhibitors display a higher affinity towards the RAG1 RNase H domain, as suggested by experimental data compared to allosteric inhibitors. While interference with RAG1 and 2 recombination is associated with a negative impact on immune function, the inhibition of metnase or HTLV‑1 integrase opens the way for the development of novel therapies for refractory cancers."

In this review, we have examined the safety, effectiveness, and practicality of utilizing trained scent dogs in clinical and public situations for COVID-19 screening. Specifically, results of 29 trained scent dog screening peer-reviewed studies were compared with results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen (RAG) COVID-19 testing methods.
OBJECTIVES: The review aims to systematically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing trained scent dogs in COVID-19 screening.
METHODS: At the time of submission of our earlier review paper in August 2021, we found only four peer-reviewed COVID-19 scent dog papers: three clinical research studies and one preprint perspective paper. In March and April 2023, the first author conducted new literature searches of the MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library websites. Again, the keyword phrases utilized for the searches included ""COVID detection dogs,"" ""COVID scent dogs,"" and ""COVID sniffer dogs."" The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Checklist was followed to ensure that our review adhered to evidence-based guidelines for reporting. Utilizing the results of the reviewed papers, we compiled statistics to intercompare and summarize basic information concerning the scent dogs and their training, the populations of the study participants, the types of sampling methods, the comparative tests utilized, and the effectiveness of the scent dog screening.
RESULTS: A total of 8,043 references were identified through our literature search. After removal of duplicates, there were 7,843 references that were screened. Of these, 100 were considered for full-text eligibility, 43 were included for qualitative synthesis, and 29 were utilized for quantitative analysis. The most relevant peer-reviewed COVID-19 scent dog references were identified and categorized. Utilizing all of the scent dog results provided for this review, we found that 92.3 % of the studies reached sensitivities exceeding 80 and 32.0 % of the studies exceeding specificities of 97 %. However, 84.0 % of the studies reported specificities above 90 %. Highlights demonstrating the effectiveness of the scent dogs include: (1) samples of breath, saliva, trachea-bronchial secretions and urine as well as face masks and articles of clothing can be utilized; (2) trained COVID-19 scent dogs can detect presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients; (3) scent dogs can detect new SARS-CoV-2 variants and Long COVID-19; and (4) scent dogs can differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infections from infections with other novel respiratory viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the trained scent dog method is comparable to or in some cases superior to the real-time RT-PCR test and the RAG test. Trained scent dogs can be effectively utilized to provide quick (seconds to minutes), nonintrusive, and accurate results in public settings and thus reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus or other viruses. Finally, scent dog research as described in this paper can serve to increase the medical community's and public's knowledge and acceptance of medical scent dogs as major contributors to global efforts to fight diseases."

However, the long-term survival and recurrence rate after LAG or RAG for locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC) has seldom been reported.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 339 patients who underwent LAG and 163 patients who underwent RAG from a prospectively established database in the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. We compared the short- and long-term oncological outcomes of the RAG group versus the LAG group in the entire cohort, and in a propensity score-matched cohort.
RESULTS: Before propensity score matching (PSM), the two groups revealed comparable 3-year overall survival rates (OS, RAG vs. LAG: 76.1 vs. 81.7%, p = 0.118), and recurrence-free survival rates (RFS, RAG vs. LAG: 73.0 vs. 67.6%, p = 0.297). Similar results were obtained in the propensity score-matched cohort; the respective overall survival rates in the propensity score-matched RAG and LAG groups were 76.1 and 79.8% (p = 0.552), and the respective RFS rates were 73.0 and 68.7% (p = 0.386). After PSM, RAG was still associated with a significantly longer mean operating time (249.46 ± 63.26 vs. 232.17 ± 65.39 min, p = 0.008) and higher total costs (133.38 ± 41.62 vs. 95.34 ± 29.39 103 RMB, p &lt; 0.001) than LAG; the two groups did not significantly differ in other surgical and oncological characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Although there were some differences in the outcomes of RAG versus LAG in AGC patients, both RAG and LAG were similar in short-term recovery and long-term oncological outcomes."

However, results may have been influenced by less-than-optimal compliance.
OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of compliance with n-3 supplementation and determine treatment effects among compliers.
DESIGN: Exploratory analyses of a multicentre-blinded randomised trial.
SETTING: 6 tertiary care centres in Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 5328 singleton pregnancies.
INTERVENTIONS: Daily capsules containing 900 mg n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids or vegetable oil, consumed from before 20 weeks gestation until 34 weeks gestation.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Early preterm (<34 weeks gestation) and preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). Women were considered compliant if they reported missing less than a third of their allocated capsules in the previous week during a mid-pregnancy appointment.
RESULTS: Among 2654 singleton pregnancies in the n-3 intervention group, 1727 (65%) were deemed compliant with supplementation. Maternal characteristics associated with compliance included age, years of full-time education, consuming alcohol but not smoking in the 3 months leading up to pregnancy, fewer previous births and taking dietary supplements at enrolment. Based on complier average causal effects, n-3 supplementation reduced the risk of preterm birth in compliers (relative risk=0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97), but not early preterm birth (relative risk=0.80; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.46). Consistent with intention-to-treat analyses, the lack of an overall effect on early preterm birth in compliers appeared to be due to beneficial effects in women with low n-3 status at enrolment but not women with replete status.
CONCLUSIONS: Results in compliers were similar to those from intention-to-treat analyses, suggesting that non-compliance was not a major factor in explaining outcomes from the ORIP trial.

The study shows that outdoor average extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) in public areas in urban environments range between 0.05 and 0.2 µT in terms of flux densities, but stronger values (of the order of a few µT) may occur directly beneath high-voltage power lines, at the walls of transformer buildings, and at the boundary fences of substations. In the indoor environment, high values have been measured close to several domestic appliances (up to the mT range), some of which are held close to the body, e.g., hair dryers, electric shavers. Common sources of exposure to intermediate frequencies (IF) include induction cookers, compact fluorescent lamps, inductive charging systems for electric cars and security or anti-theft devices. No systematic measurement surveys or personal exposimetry data for the IF range have been carried out and only a few reports on measurements of EMFs around such devices are mentioned. According to the available European exposure assessment studies, three population exposure categories were classified by the authors regarding the possible future risk analysis. This classification should be considered a crucial advancement for exposure assessment, which is a mandatory step in any future health risk assessment of EMFs exposure."

The secondary aim was to describe food availability and the physical activity built environment in participating schools.
DESIGN: This cross-sectional study examined baseline data from the intervention Mamba study assessing the effectiveness of a fortified peanut butter paste in school-aged children. Logistic regression modelling was used to test hypothesized factors in association with overweight status.
SETTING: Six primary schools in Cap-Haitien, the second largest city in Haiti.
SUBJECTS: Children (n 968) aged 3-13 years, in good health and enrolled in a participating school for the 2012/13 school year.
RESULTS: Child age (adjusted OR (AOR); 95 % CI=0·25; 0·12, 0·56), child age squared (1·08; 1·03, 1·13), always purchasing food at school (3·52; 1·12, 11·08), mother's BMI (1·10; 1·04, 1·16) and household ownership of a bicycle (0·28; 0·11, 0·71) were significantly associated with overweight (likelihood ratio=36, P<0·0001). Consumption of fish was significantly lower in overweight children in the binary analysis (P=0·033) and improved the fit of the model. Schools had limited time and space for physical activity and foods sold by vendors were predominantly high in sugar or fat.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge the present study is the first to examine the covariates of childhood overweight or describe school food availability and physical activity built environments in Haiti. Further research is necessary to identify intervention targets and feasible, cost-effective approaches for prevention of obesity in Haiti children."

The generation of protective immunity after TBEV infection or TBE vaccination relies on the integrated responses of many distinct cell types at distinct physical locations. While long-lasting memory immune responses, in particular, form the basis for the correlates of protection against many diseases, these correlates of protection have not yet been clearly defined for TBE. This review addresses the immune control of TBEV infection and responses to TBE vaccination. Potential correlates of protection and the durability of protection against disease are discussed, along with outstanding questions in the field and possible areas for future research."

Our understanding of vasculitis in partial defects in recombination activating gene (RAG) deficiency, a prototype of (S)CIDs, is limited with no published systematic evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. In this report, we sought to establish the clinical, laboratory features, and treatment outcome of patients with vasculitis due to partial RAG deficiency. Vasculitis was a major complication in eight (13%) of 62 patients in our cohort with partial RAG deficiency with features of infections and immune dysregulation. Vasculitis occurred early in life, often as first sign of disease (50%) and was complicated by significant end organ damage. Viral infections often preceded the onset of predominately non-granulomatous-small vessel vasculitis. Autoantibodies against cytokines (IFN-α, -ω, and IL-12) were detected in a large fraction of the cases tested (80%), whereas the majority of patients were anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) negative (>80%). Genetic diagnosis of RAG deficiency was delayed up to 2 years from the onset of vasculitis. Clinical cases with sole skin manifestation responded well to first-line steroid treatment, whereas systemic vasculitis with severe end-organ complications required second-line immunosuppression and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for definitive management. In conclusion, our data suggest that vasculitis in partial RAG deficiency is prevalent among patients with partial RAG deficiency and is associated with high morbidity. Therefore, partial RAG deficiency should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with early-onset systemic vasculitis. Diagnostic serology may be misleading with ANCA negative findings, and search for conventional autoantibodies should be extended to include those targeting cytokines."

Epub 2015 Jul 25.,Shen W,Surg Endosc,2016,2015/07/26,,,10.1007/s00464-015-4241-7,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) is a new minimally invasive surgical technique for gastric cancer. This study was designed to compare RAG with laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) in short-term surgical outcomes.
METHODS: Between October 2011 and August 2014, 423 patients underwent robotic or laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: 93 RAG and 330 LAG. We performed a comparative analysis between RAG group and LAG group for clinicopathological characteristics and short-term surgical outcomes.
RESULTS: RAG was associated with a longer operative time (P < 0.001), lower blood loss (P = 0.001), and more harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.047). Only three patients in LAG group had positive margins, and R0 resection rate for RAG and LAG was similar (P = 0.823). The RAG group had postoperative complications of 9.8 %, comparable with those of the LAG group (P = 0.927). Proximal margin, distal margin, hospital stay, days of first flatus, and days of eating liquid diet for RAG and LAG were similar. In the subgroup of serosa-negative patients, RAG had a longer operation time (P = 0.003), less intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.005), and more harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.04). However, in the subgroup of serosa-positive patients, RAG had a longer operation time (P = 0.001), but no less intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.139) and no more harvested lymph nodes (P = 0.139). Similarly, in the subgroup of total gastrectomy patients, RAG had a longer operation time (P = 0.018), but no less intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.173).
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative study demonstrates that RAG is as acceptable as LAG in terms of surgical and oncologic outcomes. With lower estimated blood loss, acceptable complications, and radical resection, RAG is a promising approach for the treatment of gastric cancer. However, the indication of patients for RAG is critical."

Epub 2020 Sep 9.,Wang TKM,Circ Cardiovasc Imaging,2020,2020/09/09,,,10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.120.011126,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is emerging as an adjunctive modality to echocardiography in the evaluation of infective endocarditis (IE) and surgical planning. CT studies in IE have, however, focused on its diagnostic rather than prognostic utility, the latter of which is important in high-risk diseases like IE. We evaluated the associations between cardiac CT and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) findings and adverse outcomes after IE surgery.
METHODS: Of 833 consecutive patients with surgically proven IE during May 1, 2014 to May 1, 2019, at Cleveland Clinic, 155 underwent both preoperative ECG-gated contrast-enhanced CT and TEE. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify CT and TEE biomarkers that predict adverse outcomes after IE surgery, adjusting for EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac operative Risk Evaluation II).
RESULTS: CT and TEE were positive for IE in 123 (75.0%) and 124 (75.6%) of patients, respectively. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 3 (1.9%) patients and composite mortality or morbidities in 72 (46.5%). Pseudoaneurysm or abscess detected on TEE was the only imaging biomarker to show independent association with composite mortality or morbidities in-hospital, with odds ratio (95% CI) of 3.66 (1.76-7.59), P=0.001. There were 17 late deaths, and both pseudoaneurysm or abscess detected on CT and fistula detected on CT were the only independent predictors of total mortality during follow-up, with hazards ratios (95% CI) of 3.82 (1.25-11.7), P&lt;0.001 and 9.84 (1.89-51.0), P=0.007, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified cardiac CT and TEE features that predicted separate adverse outcomes after IE surgery. Imaging biomarkers can play important roles incremental to conventional clinical factors for risk stratification in patients undergoing IE surgery."

Perception of risk associated with cannabis use is correlated negatively with the prevalence of use, but the causal nature of this association is debated. The aim of this study is to quantitate the reciprocal associations between cannabis use and risk perception in a longitudinal panel of emerging adults.
DESIGN: Observational study of longitudinal data from the Monitoring the Future longitudinal study using autoregressive cross-lagged panel analyses to investigate reciprocal associations between cannabis risk perception and frequency of past-year cannabis use.
SETTING: Surveys administered to 12th-grade students from the United States general population.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9929 12th-grade students (mean age 18.0 years) who were surveyed initially during 2000-05 and follow-up data until approximately 23-24 years old (three waves; n = 9929).
MEASUREMENTS: Perception of risk association with cannabis use and frequency of past-year cannabis use.
RESULTS: At baseline, 33% of the 12th-graders used cannabis in the past year versus 28% by the third follow-up; 83% believed that smoking cannabis regularly carried moderate or great risk versus 78% by the third follow-up. All cross-lagged paths in both directions were statistically significant (all P < 0.001), consistent with reciprocal influences between cannabis use and risk perception. The negative association between past-year cannabis use and subsequent risk perception (standardized coefficient range -0.21 to -0.27) was stronger than that between risk perception and subsequent use (standardized coefficient range -0.08 to -0.11; confidence intervals did not overlap with those for the coefficients reported above). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was limited to those who had never used cannabis prior to baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal associations between cannabis use and perception of risks from cannabis use are reciprocal in nature, with a stronger association between cannabis use and lower subsequent risk perception."

METHODS: DELIVER High Risk was a retrospective observational cohort study of 2550 patients with T2D who switched BIA to Gla-300 (Gla-300 switchers) and were propensity score-matched (1:1) to patients who switched to Gla-100 or IDet (Gla-100/IDet switchers). Outcomes were change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), attainment of HbA1c goals (<7% and <8%), and incidence and event rates of hypoglycaemia (all-hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia associated with an inpatient/emergency department [ED] contact).
RESULTS: HbA1c reductions were similar following switching to Gla-300 or Gla-100/IDet (-0.51% vs. -0.53%; p = .67), and patients showed similar attainment of HbA1c goals. Patients in both cohorts had comparable all-hypoglycaemia incidence and event rates.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DELIVER Naive D was a retrospective observational study that used electronic medical record data from the IBM Watson Health Explorys database. Insulin-naïve adults with T2D who started Gla-300 or IDeg between March 2015 and September 2017 were identified. Patients were active in the system for ≥12 months before and ≥6 months after starting Gla-300 or IDeg and had HbA1c measurements during 6-month baseline and 3- to 6-month follow-up. Outcomes were compared among 1:1 propensity score-matched cohorts.
RESULTS: In the matched cohorts (n = 638 each), the mean age was 59 years, approximately 53% were male, and mean HbA1c was 9.67% (82 mmol/mol). Mean (SD) HbA1c decreases were comparable in the Gla-300 and IDeg cohorts (-1.67% [2.22] and -1.58% [2.20]; P = 0.51), as were HbA1c target attainment [<7% (53 mmol/mol): 23.8% and 27.4%; P = 0.20; <8% (64 mmol/mol): 55.0% and 57.1%; P = 0.63] and treatment discontinuation (29.2% and 32.6%; P = 0.14). Overall and inpatient/emergency department-associated hypoglycaemia incidences and event rates were similar in both cohorts using fixed 6-month or variable on-treatment follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Among real-world insulin-naïve adults with T2D, initiation of Gla-300 or IDeg resulted in comparable improvements in glycaemic control and similar rates of hypoglycaemia. These real-world data complement and confirm a randomized trial and other real-world studies."

METHODS: IgG autoantibodies to 390 distinct unmodified and corresponding in vitro citrullinated recombinant proteins were measured by a multiplex assay in baseline blood samples from a German multicenter national cohort of 411 early arthritis patients (56.5 ± 14.6 years, 62.8% female). The cohort was randomly split into a training cohort (n = 329, 28.6% ACPA positive) and a validation cohort (n = 82, 32.9% ACPA pos.). The diagnostic properties of candidate antibodies to predict a subsequent diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as opposed to a non-RA diagnosis were assessed by receiver operating characteristics analysis and generalized linear modeling (GLM) with Bonferroni correction in comparison to clinically determined IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) and citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) status.
RESULTS: Of 411 patients, 309 (75.2%) were classified as RA. Detection rates of antibody responses to citrullinated and uncitrullinated forms of the proteins were weakly correlated (Spearman's r = 0.13 (95% CI 0.029-0.22), p = 0.01). The concentration of 34 autoantibodies (32 to citrullinated and 2 to uncitrullinated antigens) was increased at least 2-fold in RA patients and further assessed. In the training cohort, a significant association of citrullinated ""transformer 2 beta homolog"" (cTRA2B)-IgG with RA was observed (OR 5.3 × 103, 95% CI 0.8 × 103-3.0 × 106, p = 0.047). Sensitivity and specificity of cTRA2B-IgG (51.0%/82.9%) were comparable to RF (30.8%/91.6%) or ACPA (32.1%/94.7%). Similar results were obtained in the validation cohort. The addition of cTRA2B-IgG to ACPA improved the diagnostic performance over ACPA alone (p = 0.026 by likelihood ratio test).
CONCLUSIONS: cTRA2B-IgG has the potential to improve RA diagnosis in conjunction with RF and ACPA in early arthritis."

These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury. Management principles for ICI-related lung injury, including current consensus on steroid refractory pneumonitis and the use of other immune modulating agents in this setting are also highlighted."

Person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions may positively influence the impact of shift work on sleep, thereby improving workers' well-being, safety, and health.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions for reducing sleepiness at work and improving the length and quality of sleep between shifts for shift workers.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase, Web of Knowledge, ProQuest, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, and OSH-UPDATE from inception to August 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings and searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Trial register. We contacted experts to obtain unpublished data.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (including cross-over designs) that investigated the effect of any person-directed, non-pharmacological intervention on sleepiness on-shift or sleep length and sleep quality off-shift in shift workers who also work nights.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors screened titles and abstracts for relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors to obtain missing information. We conducted meta-analyses when pooling of studies was possible.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence. Overall, the included studies' results were inconclusive. We present the results regarding sleepiness below. Bright light Combining two comparable studies (with 184 participants altogether) that investigated the effect of bright light during the night on sleepiness during a shift, revealed a mean reduction 0.83 score points of sleepiness (measured via the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to -0.36, very low quality evidence). Another trial did not find a significant difference in overall sleepiness on another sleepiness scale (16 participants, low quality evidence).Bright light during the night plus sunglasses at dawn did not significantly influence sleepiness compared to normal light (1 study, 17 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence).Bright light during the day shift did not significantly reduce sleepiness during the day compared to normal light (1 trial, 61 participants, subjective assessment, low quality evidence) or compared to normal light plus placebo capsule (1 trial, 12 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence). Napping during the night shiftA meta-analysis on a single nap opportunity and the effect on the mean reaction time as a surrogate for sleepiness, resulted in a 11.87 ms reduction (95% CI 31.94 to -8.2, very low quality evidence). Two other studies also reported statistically non-significant decreases in reaction time (1 study seven participants; 1 study 49 participants, very low quality evidence).A two-nap opportunity resulted in a statistically non-significant increase of sleepiness (subjective assessment) in one study (mean difference (MD) 2.32, 95% CI -24.74 to 29.38, 1 study, 15 participants, low quality evidence). Other interventionsPhysical exercise and sleep education interventions showed promise, but sufficient data to draw conclusions are lacking.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the methodological diversity of the included studies, in terms of interventions, settings, and assessment tools, their limited reporting and the very low to low quality of the evidence they present, it is not possible to determine whether shift workers' sleepiness can be reduced or if their sleep length or quality can be improved with these interventions.We need better and adequately powered RCTs of the effect of bright light, and naps, either on their own or together and other non-pharmacological interventions that also consider shift workers' chronobiology on the investigated sleep parameters."

METHOD: The prospective, observational study was conducted at the Children's Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from January 2017 to December 2018, and comprised children developing features of inflammatory bowel disease aged <6 years. Data included demography, clinical presentation, diagnostic tools and outcome. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.
RESULTS: Of the 60 children with relevant symptoms, 26(43.3%) were diagnosed as having very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Of them, 13(50%) had underlying monogenic defect, and 16(61.5%) had ulcerative colitis. There were 22(84.6%) males with median age of 1.5(11) months in monogenic inflammatory bowel disease versus 24(43) months for non-monogenic inflammatory bowel disease (p<0.05). In the monogenic group, isolated rectal bleeding was the major presentation 13(100%) versus non-monogenic who presented mainly with failure to thrive 13(100%). Upper and lower endoscopies with histopathology had good diagnostic yield and inflammatory infiltrates on the biopsied tissues were the major findings. Mutations detected among the subjects were XIAP, PRKDC, PIK3CD, RAG-1, LRBA, DOCK8, TTC7, MEFV and EPCAM. Mortality was significantly higher in the monogenic group 7(54%) than in the non-monogenic group 2(15%) (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease should be suspected when conventional management fails to rectify common disease mimickers. Testing for underlying immunological defect and genetic mutation would be helpful for managing these rare disorders."

METHODS: In this retrospective comparative study, 163 consecutive eyes with various diseases that underwent 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with or without ultraspeed transformer by a single surgeon from June 2012 through December 2014 were analyzed in regard to best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and surgery time.
RESULTS: In 2 eyes (1.2%), peripheral retina breaks were encountered intraoperatively, yet no other complications were found in those eyes. No cases required larger-gauge vitrectomy. Mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 20/58 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.46 ± 0.64) preoperatively to 20/32 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.20 ± 0.40) postoperatively (P < 0.001). Mean follow-up was 16.7 months (range, 6-33 months). Intraocular pressure remained stable throughout the postoperative course. Hypotony was seen in 15 eyes (9.2%) at 1-day postoperative, yet that spontaneously improved within 1 week. No case of retinal detachment or endophthalmitis was recorded. In macular surgeries, such as idiopathic epiretinal membrane and macular hole combined with cataract surgery, the mean surgery time was 32.1 ± 6.9 minutes with ultraspeed transformer (n = 38) and 37.1 ± 7.7 minutes without ultraspeed transformer (n = 40) (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: The 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was found to be safe and effective for treating various vitreoretinal disorders."

SUMMARY ANSWER: Men working non-daytime/rotating shifts and those with physically demanding jobs have higher sperm concentration and total sperm count as well as higher estradiol and total testosterone concentrations.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Semen quality has declined during recent decades and has been negatively correlated with higher risks of common chronic diseases and mortality, highlighting its public health importance beyond fertility and reproduction. While most of the previous epidemiology literature on male fertility has focused on environmental exposures, dietary factors, and other related variables, little attention has been paid to occupational factors.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This observational study included 377 men who were male partners in couples seeking infertility treatment at a fertility center, who enrolled in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) study between 2005 and 2019.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Self-reported information on lifting/moving heavy objects, typical shift, and physical level of exertion at work was collected from a take-home questionnaire. Semen samples were analyzed following World Health Organization guidelines. Enzyme immunoassays were used to assess reproductive hormone concentrations. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between occupational factors and measures of testicular function, while adjusting for covariates such as age, BMI, education, race, smoking, and abstinence time, and accounting for multiple semen samples (mean = 2, min-max = 1-9) in analyses for semen parameters.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Men had a median (interquartile range) age of 36 (33, 39) years and were predominantly Caucasian (87%). Of the men who completed the survey, 12% reported often lifting or moving heavy objects at work, 6% reported heavy physical exertion at work, and 9% reported evening or rotating shifts. Men who reported often lifting or moving heavy objects at work had 46% higher sperm concentrations (P = 0.01) and 44% higher total counts (P = 0.01) compared with men who reported never lifting or moving heavy objects at work. Similar results were found for men working in rotating shifts compared to those in day shifts, as well as for men involved in heavy levels of physical exertion compared to those with light levels at work. We also found that men involved in heavy/moderate levels of physical exertion at work had higher circulating testosterone concentrations compared to those with lighter exertion (adjusted means of 515 and 427 ng/dl, respectively, P = 0.08), and men who often moved/lifted heavy objects at work had higher estradiol concentrations, compared to those who never did (adjusted means of 36.8 and 27.1 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.07). Men working evening/rotating shifts had 24% higher testosterone (P = 0.04) and 45% higher estradiol concentrations (P = 0.01), compared to men working day shifts. No associations were observed for ejaculated volume, total motility, morphologically normal sperm, or serum FSH and LH concentrations.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Due to our study design which recruited men from couples seeking fertility treatment, it may not be possible to generalize our findings to men from the general population. Also, as is the case of all studies based on self-reported questionnaires, measurement error and misclassification of the exposure are potential concerns.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Physically demanding jobs and rotating or evening shift occupations may be associated with higher testicular function in men measured as higher sperm concentrations and counts as well as higher serum testosterone and estradiol levels. Confirmation of these findings in other non-fertility clinic study populations is warranted.

Debt Counselling for Depression in Primary Care: an adaptive randomised controlled pilot trial (DeCoDer) aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the addition of a primary care debt counselling advice service to usual care for patients with depression and debt. However, the study was terminated early during the internal pilot trial phase because of recruitment delays. This report describes the rationale, methods and findings of the pilot study, and implications for future research.
OBJECTIVES: The overarching aim of the internal pilot was to identify and resolve problems, thereby assessing the feasibility of the main trial. The specific objectives were to confirm methods for practice recruitment and the ability to recruit patients via the proposed approaches; to determine the acceptability of the study interventions and outcome measures; to assess contamination; to confirm the randomisation method for main trial and the level of participant attrition; and to check the robustness of data collection systems.
DESIGN: An adaptive, parallel, two-group multicentre randomised controlled pilot trial with a nested mixed-methods process and economic evaluation. Both individual- and cluster (general practice)-level were was used in the pilot phase to assign participants to intervention or control groups.
SETTING: General practices in England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals were included who were aged ≥ 18 years, scored ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory II and self-identified as having debt worries. The main exclusion criteria were being actively suicidal or psychotic and/or severely depressed and unresponsive to treatment; having a severe addiction to alcohol/illicit drugs; being unable/unwilling to give written informed consent; currently participating in other research including follow-up phases; having received Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) debt advice in the past year; and not wanting debt advice via a general practice.
INTERVENTIONS: The participants in the intervention group were given debt advice provided by the CAB and shared biopsychosocial assessment, in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) and two debt advice leaflets. The participants in the control group were given advice leaflets provided by the general practitioner and TAU only.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Outcomes of the pilot trial - the proportion of eligible patients who consented, the number of participants recruited compared with target, assessment of contamination, and assessment of patient satisfaction with intervention and outcome measures. (2) Participant outcomes - primary - Beck Depression Inventory II; secondary - psychological well-being, health and social care utilisation, service satisfaction, substance misuse, record of priority/non-priority debts, life events and difficulties, and explanatory measures. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 4 months post randomisation. Other data sources - qualitative interviews were conducted with participants, clinicians and CAB advisors.
RESULTS: Of the 238 expressions of interest screened, 61 participants (26%) were recruited and randomised (32 in the intervention group and 29 in the control group). All participants provided baseline outcomes and 52 provided the primary outcome at 4 months' follow-up (14.7% dropout). Seventeen participants allocated to the intervention saw a CAB advisor. Descriptive statistics are reported for participants with complete outcomes at baseline and 4 months' follow-up. Our qualitative findings suggest that the relationship between debt and depression is complex, and the impact of each on the other is compounded by other psychological, social and contextual influences.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of low recruitment, this trial was terminated at the internal pilot phase and was too small for inferential statistical analysis. We recommend ways to reduce this risk when conducting complex trials among vulnerable populations recruited in community settings. These cover trial design, the design and delivery of interventions, recruitment strategies and support for sites.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to systemic inflammation, which is associated with poorer MS disease evolution. We compared persons with MS (PwMS) and controls to assess metabolic and lifestyle parameters associated with MS.
METHODS: We pooled data from two prospective observational studies with the same eligibility criteria, matching PwMS and controls (1:2 ratio) by sex, age, and body mass index (BMI). We compared anthropometric, biological and lifestyle parameters, including sleep and physical activity.
RESULTS: We included 53 PwMS and 106 controls with a median age of 35 years and 79% of women. PwMS had low Expanded Disability Status Scale (median 1.5). Compared to controls, PwMS had increased waist-to-hip (p<0.001) and waist-to-height (p=0.007) ratios, and practiced less physical activity (p=0.03). In regression models, lifestyle factors with the strongest factor loadings to predict central obesity were processed food consumption, and vigorous physical activity.
DISCUSSION: Although both groups were matched by age, sex, and BMI, we found increased central obesity in PwMS. Even with minimal neurological impairment, PwMS practiced less physical activity. This suggests that improvement of lifestyle and metabolic parameters should be targeted in MS."

Epub 2018 Apr 5.,Rickard J,Surg Infect (Larchmt),2018,2018/04/06,,,10.1089/sur.2017.158,"BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of the worsening problem of antibiotic resistance and the need for antibiotic stewardship in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was to describe antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in patients undergoing surgery for peritonitis at a Rwandan referral hospital.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All surgical patients with peritonitis at a Rwandan referral hospital were enrolled. Prospective data were collected on epidemiology, clinical features, interventions, and outcomes. Antibiotic agents were prescribed and cultures were collected according to surgeon discretion. High risk for antibiotic treatment failure or death was defined as patients with severe sepsis, older than 70 years of age, tumor, or operating room delay more than 24 hours from hospital admission. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with high risk of antibiotic treatment failure or death.
RESULTS: Over a six-month period, 280 patients underwent operation for peritonitis; 79 patients were excluded because no infectious etiology was identified at operation. Data on antibiotic usage were available for 165 patients. The most common diagnoses were intestinal obstruction (n = 43) and appendicitis (n = 36). Most patients received antibiotic agents, the most of of which being third-generation cephalosporins (n = 149; 90%) and metronidazole (n = 140; 85%). The mean duration of antibiotics was 5.1 days (range: 0-14). Overall, 80 (54%) patients were high-risk for antibiotic treatment failure or death. Risk for antibiotic treatment failure or death was associated with localized peritonitis (p = 0.001) and high American Society of Anesthesiologist score (p = 0.003). Cultures were collected from 33 patients and seven patients had an organism isolated. Escherichia coli was identified in in five surgical specimens and two 2 urine cultures. All Escherichia coli specimens showed resistance to cephalosporins.
CONCLUSIONS: Broad antibiotic coverage with third-generation cephalosporins and metronidazole is common in Rwandan surgical patients with peritonitis. Areas for improvement should focus on choice and duration of antibiotic agents, tailored to underlying diagnosis and risk factors for antibiotic treatment failure or death. More data are needed on antibiotic resistance patterns to guide antimicrobial therapy."

Pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, combined with epacadostat, an indoleamine 2,3-deoxygenase 1 selective inhibitor, demonstrated promising antitumor activity in a phase 1 study in advanced solid tumors, including mRCC.
METHODS: KEYNOTE-679/ECHO-302 was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 study (NCT03260894) that compared pembrolizumab plus epacadostat with sunitinib or pazopanib as first-line treatment for mRCC. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic clear cell RCC and had not received systemic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks plus epacadostat 100 mg orally twice daily versus sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily (4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off treatment) or pazopanib 800 mg orally once daily. Original dual primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. Enrollment was stopped when a phase 3 study in melanoma of pembrolizumab plus epacadostat compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy did not meet its primary end point. This protocol was amended, and primary end point was changed to investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1.
RESULTS: One-hundred-twenty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab plus epacadostat (n = 64) or sunitinib/pazopanib (n = 65). Median (range) follow-up, defined as time from randomization to data cutoff, was 10.3 months (2.2-14.3) and 10.3 months (2.7-13.8) in the pembrolizumab plus epacadostat and sunitinib/pazopanib arms, respectively. ORRs were similar between pembrolizumab plus epacadostat (31.3% [95% CI 20.2-44.1] and sunitinib/pazopanib (29.2% [18.6-41.8]). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34.4% and 42.9% of patients in the pembrolizumab plus epacadostat and sunitinib/pazopanib arms, respectively. One patient in the sunitinib/pazopanib arm died of septic shock (not treatment-related). Circulating kynurenine levels decreased in the pembrolizumab plus epacadostat arm, but not to levels observed in healthy subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: ORRs were similar between pembrolizumab plus epacadostat and sunitinib/pazopanib as first-line treatment in patients with mRCC. Safety and tolerability appeared similar between treatment arms; no new safety concerns were identified. Antitumor responses observed in patients with RCC receiving pembrolizumab plus epacadostat may be driven primarily by pembrolizumab.

We assessed whether machine learning (ML) could predict CRT response beyond current guidelines.
METHODS: We analyzed CRT patients from Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins. A training cohort was created from all Johns Hopkins patients and an equal number of randomly sampled Cleveland Clinic patients. All remaining patients comprised the testing cohort. Response was defined as ≥10% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. ML models were developed to predict CRT response using different combinations of classification algorithms and clinical variable sets on the training cohort. The model with the highest area under the curve was evaluated on the testing cohort. Probability of response was used to predict survival free from a composite end point of death, heart transplant, or placement of left ventricular assist device. Predictions were compared with current guidelines.
RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-five patients were included. On the training cohort (n=470: 235, Johns Hopkins; 235, Cleveland Clinic), the best ML model was a naive Bayes classifier including 9 variables (QRS morphology, QRS duration, New York Heart Association classification, left ventricular ejection fraction and end-diastolic diameter, sex, ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and epicardial left ventricular lead). On the testing cohort (n=455, Cleveland Clinic), ML demonstrated better response prediction than guidelines (area under the curve, 0.70 versus 0.65; P=0.012) and greater discrimination of event-free survival (concordance index, 0.61 versus 0.56; P<0.001). The fourth quartile of the ML model had the greatest risk of reaching the composite end point, whereas the first quartile had the least (hazard ratio, 0.34; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: ML with 9 variables incrementally improved prediction of echocardiographic CRT response and survival beyond guidelines. Performance was not improved by incorporating more variables.

Epub 2020 Jun 14.,Feeny AK,Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,2020,2020/06/16,PMC7901121,NIHMS1604765,10.1161/CIRCEP.119.008210,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves heart failure outcomes but has significant nonresponse rates, highlighting limitations in ECG selection criteria: QRS duration (QRSd) ≥150 ms and subjective labeling of left bundle branch block (LBBB). We explored unsupervised machine learning of ECG waveforms to identify CRT subgroups that may differentiate outcomes beyond QRSd and LBBB.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 946 CRT patients with conduction delay. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction obtained a 2-dimensional representation of preCRT 12-lead QRS waveforms. k-means clustering of the 2-dimensional PCA representation of 12-lead QRS waveforms identified 2 patient subgroups (QRS PCA groups). Vectorcardiographic QRS area was also calculated. We examined following 2 primary outcomes: (1) composite end point of death, left ventricular assist device, or heart transplant, and (2) degree of echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) change after CRT.
RESULTS: Compared with QRS PCA Group 2 (n=425), Group 1 (n=521) had lower risk for reaching the composite end point (HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.38-0.53]; P&lt;0.001) and experienced greater mean LVEF improvement (11.1±11.7% versus 4.8±9.7%; P&lt;0.001), even among patients with LBBB with QRSd ≥150 ms (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30-0.57]; P&lt;0.001; mean LVEF change 12.5±11.8% versus 7.3±8.1%; P=0.001). QRS area also stratified outcomes but had significant differences from QRS PCA groups. A stratification scheme combining QRS area and QRS PCA group identified patients with LBBB with similar outcomes to non-LBBB patients (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.93-1.62]; difference in mean LVEF change: 0.8% [95% CI, -2.1% to 3.7%]). The stratification scheme also identified patients with LBBB with QRSd &lt;150 ms with comparable outcomes to patients with LBBB with QRSd ≥150 ms (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.67-1.29]; difference in mean LVEF change: -0.2% [95% CI, -2.7% to 3.0%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised machine learning of ECG waveforms identified CRT subgroups with relevance beyond LBBB and QRSd. This method may assist in objective classification of bundle branch block morphology in CRT."

Besides the intriguing virology, this small RNA is known to adopt many length-dependent conformations, as verified by multiple experimental and computational approaches. However, the role these alternative conformations play in the frameshifting mechanism and how to quantify this structural abundance has been an ongoing challenge. Here, we show by DMS and dual-luciferase functional assays that previously predicted FSE mutants (using the RAG graph theory approach) suppress structural transitions and abolish frameshifting. Furthermore, correlated mutation analysis of DMS data by three programs (DREEM, DRACO, and DANCE-MaP) reveals important differences in their estimation of specific RNA conformations, suggesting caution in the interpretation of such complex conformational landscapes. Overall, the abolished frameshifting in three different mutants confirms that all alternative conformations play a role in the pathways of ribosomal transition."

Epub 2023 Oct 13.,Rosen S,Eur Radiol,2024,2023/10/12,,,10.1007/s00330-023-10230-0,"OBJECTIVES: As the technology continues to evolve and advance, we can expect to see artificial intelligence (AI) being used in increasingly sophisticated ways to make a diagnosis and decisions such as suggesting the most appropriate imaging referrals. We aim to explore whether Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can provide accurate imaging referrals for clinical use that are at least as good as the ESR iGuide.
METHODS: A comparative study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Data was collected from 97 consecutive cases that were admitted to the emergency department with abdominal complaints. We compared the imaging test referral recommendations suggested by the ESR iGuide and the ChatGPT and analyzed cases of disagreement. In addition, we selected cases where ChatGPT recommended a chest abdominal pelvis (CAP) CT (n = 66), and asked four specialists to grade the appropriateness of the referral.
RESULTS: ChatGPT recommendations were consistent with the recommendations provided by the ESR iGuide. No statistical differences were found between the appropriateness of referrals by age or gender. Using a sub-analysis of CAP cases, a high agreement between ChatGPT and the specialists was found. Cases of disagreement (12.4%) were further analyzed and presented themes of vague recommendations such as ""it would be advisable"" and ""this would help to rule out.""
CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT's ability to guide the selection of appropriate tests may be comparable to some degree with the ESR iGuide. Features such as the clinical, ethical, and regulatory implications are still warranted and need to be addressed prior to clinical implementation. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The article explores the potential of using advanced language models, such as ChatGPT, in healthcare as a CDS for selecting appropriate imaging tests. Using ChatGPT can improve the efficiency of the decision-making process KEY POINTS: • ChatGPT recommendations were highly consistent with the recommendations provided by the ESR iGuide. • ChatGPT's ability in guiding the selection of appropriate tests may be comparable to some degree with ESR iGuide's."

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 533 such patients (age, 66±13 years; 78% men; 31% with coronary artery disease) who underwent exercise stress echocardiography between 2001 and 2012. Clinical, echocardiographic, and exercise variables (metabolic equivalents [METs], % of age-sex-predicted METs and heart rate recovery at first minute post exercise) were recorded. The end point was all-cause mortality. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean resting aortic valve (AV) gradient, indexed AV area, METs, and heart rate recovery were 2.9±3%, 58±4%, 35±11 mm Hg, 0.47±0.1 cm(2)/m(2), 7.8±3, and 26±12 bpm, respectively. Only 50% achieved >100%, whereas 26% achieved <85% age-sex-predicted METs. There were no major exercise stress echocardiography-related complications. Over 6.9±3 years, 341 (64%) underwent AV replacement (54% isolated), and there were 104 (20%) deaths. On multivariable Cox proportional hazard survival analysis, a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (hazard ratio, 1.21), lower % age-sex-predicted METs (hazard ratio 1.15), and slower heart rate recovery (hazard ratio, 1.22) were associated with higher longer-term mortality, whereas AV replacement (time-dependent covariate, hazard ratio, 0.26) was associated with improved survival. The addition of % age-sex-predicted METs to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score resulted in significant reclassification of longer-term mortality risk (integrated discrimination index, 0.07 [0.03-0.11; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction undergoing exercise stress echocardiography, a lower % of age-sex-predicted METs and slower heart rate recovery were associated with longer-term mortality, whereas AV replacement was associated with improved survival."

However, corresponding data on potential differences in the variability of such performance measures are still lacking, to date. Hence, the aim of this study was to conduct internet-based mental chronometry in both poorly standardized domestic and highly standardized laboratory environments and to compare the variabilities of the corresponding performance measures. Using the Millisecond Inquisit4Web software, 127 men and women completed three different RT-based cognitive paradigms (i.e., go/no-go, two-back, and number-letter). Each participant completed all paradigms in two environments (i.e., at home and in the laboratory), with a time lag of seven days and in a counterbalanced order. Mixed-effects modeling was employed to estimate the between-setting variability across a comprehensive set of performance measures, including conventional measures of central tendency (i.e., mean RT and ERR) and further measures characterizing the joint distribution of RT/ERR. The latter measures were estimated using the diffusion model. The results suggested negligible differences between the domestic and laboratory settings. Thus, this study provides novel evidence suggesting that the statistical power of internet-based mental chronometry is commonly not compromised by increased environmental variance. The within- and between-session reliabilities were in a satisfactory range-that is, comparable to performance measures collected offline in laboratory settings. In consequence, our results support the broad applicability, robustness, and cost efficiency of mental chronometry assessment using the internet."

Print 2015 Feb.,Unger JM,J Natl Cancer Inst,2014,2014/12/26,PMC4326312,,10.1093/jnci/dju412,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion of new cancer treatments can be both inefficient and incomplete. The uptake of new treatments over time (diffusion) has not been well studied. We analyzed the diffusion of docetaxel in metastatic prostate cancer.
METHODS: We identified metastatic prostate cancer patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2007 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare database. Medicare claims through 2008 were analyzed. We assessed cumulative incidence of docetaxel by socioeconomic, demographic, and comorbidity variables, and compared diffusion patterns to landmark events including release of phase III results and FDA approval dates. We compared docetaxel diffusion patterns in prostate cancer to those in metastatic breast, lung, ovarian, and gastric cancers. To model docetaxel use over time, we used the classic ""mixed influence"" deterministic diffusion model. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: We identified 6561 metastatic prostate cancer patients; 1350 subsequently received chemotherapy. Among patients who received chemotherapy, docetaxel use was 95% by 2008. Docetaxel uptake was statistically significantly slower (P < .01) for patients older than 65 years, blacks, patients in lower income areas, and those who experienced poverty. Eighty percent of docetaxel diffusion occurred prior to the May, 2004 release of phase III results showing superiority of docetaxel over standard-of-care. The maximum increase in the rate of use of docetaxel occurred nearly simultaneously for prostate cancer as for all other cancers combined (in 2000).
CONCLUSION: Efforts to increase the diffusion of treatments with proven survival benefits among disadvantaged populations could lead to cancer population survival gains. Docetaxel diffusion mostly preceded phase III evidence for its efficacy in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and appeared to be a cancer-wide-rather than a disease-specific-phenomenon. Diffusion prior to definitive evidence indicates the prevalence of off-label chemotherapy use."

This study aimed to evaluate the possible African swine fever (ASF) distribution using network analysis and a diffusion model through live pig, carcass, and pig product movement data.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Empirical movement data from Thailand for the year 2019 were used, and expert opinions were sought to evaluate network properties and the diffusion model. The networks were presented as live pig movement and carcass movement data at the provincial and district levels. For network analysis, a descriptive network analysis was performed using outdegree, indegree, betweenness, fragmentation, and power law distribution, and cutpoints were used to describe movement patterns. For the diffusion model, we simulated each network using spatially different infected locations, patterns, and initial infection sites. Based on expert opinions, the initial infection site, the probability of ASF occurrence, and the probability of the initial infected adopter were selected for the appropriated network. In this study, we also simulated networks under varying network parameters to predict the infection speed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The total number of movements recorded was 2,594,364. These were divided into 403,408 (403,408/2,594,364; 15.55%) for live pigs and 2,190,956 (2,190,956/2,594,364; 84.45%) for carcasses. We found that carcass movement at the provincial level showed the highest outdegree (mean = 342.554, standard deviation (SD) = 900.528) and indegree values (mean = 342.554, SD = 665.509). In addition, the outdegree and indegree presented similar mean values and the degree distributions of both district networks followed a power-law function. The network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for betweenness (mean = 0.011, SD = 0.017), and the network of live pigs at provincial level showed the highest value for fragmentation (mean = 0.027, SD = 0.005). Our simulation data indicated that the disease occurred randomly due to live pig and carcass movements along the central and western regions of Thailand, causing the rapid spread of ASF. Without control measures, it could spread to all provinces within 5- and 3-time units and in all districts within 21- and 30-time units for the network of live pigs and carcasses, respectively. This study assists the authorities to plan control and preventive measures and limit economic losses caused by ASF."

In longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) where structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is collected from individuals at multiple time points, participants may miss a study visit or drop out. Additionally, technical issues such as participant motion in the scanner may result in unusable imaging data at designated visits. Such missing data may hinder the development of high-quality imaging-based biomarkers. Furthermore, when imaging data are unavailable in clinical practice, patients may not benefit from effective application of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring.
METHODS: To address the problem of missing MRI data in studies of AD, we introduced a novel 3D diffusion model specifically designed for imputing missing structural MRI (Recovery of Missing Neuroimaging using Diffusion models (ReMiND)). The model generates a whole-brain image conditional on a single structural MRI observed at a past visit or conditional on one past and one future observed structural MRI relative to the missing observation.
RESULTS: Experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality individual 3D structural MRI with high similarity to ground truth, observed images. Additionally, images generated using ReMiND exhibit relatively lower error rates and more accurately estimated rates of atrophy over time in important anatomical brain regions compared with two alternative imputation approaches: forward filling and image generation using variational autoencoders.
CONCLUSION: Our 3D diffusion model can impute missing structural MRI data at a single designated visit and outperforms alternative methods for imputing whole-brain images that are missing from longitudinal trajectories."

Epub 2015 Feb 13.,Cunningham ME,Hepatology,2015,2014/10/21,,,10.1002/hep.27570,"UNLABELLED: Emerging therapies for chronic hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection involve inhibition of viral enzymes with drug combinations. Natural, or treatment-induced, enzyme polymorphisms reduce efficacy. We developed a phenotyping assay to aid drug selection based on viral transfer from monocytes to hepatocytes. We studied HCV in monocytes from infected patients and developed a model in which patient-derived HCV is ""captured"" by the cell line THP-1 and replication assessed after fusion to hepatoma cells. We found that monocytes from HCV-infected patients harbor virus that replicates when cells are fused to hepatocytes. THP-1 cells incubated with infected sera capture HCV, which replicates when fused to hepatocytes. Inhibitable replication of all HCV genotypes was achieved (42 of 52 isolates). We measured sensitivity of telaprevir (TVR) and alisporivir (AVR) in different genotypes, and showed differences in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) correlating with clinical response (TVR IC50 for genotype (G)1 was 0.042 ± 0.003 vs. 0.117 ± 0.015 μM for G3, whereas AVR IC50 for G1 was 0.139 ± 0.013 vs. 0.044 ± 0.007 μM for G3). We tested TVR-resistant viral isolates and identified changes in IC50 . One patient with a poor clinical response to TVR and wild-type viral sequence showed reduced TVR sensitivity in our assay. We studied samples from a 2-week TVR monotherapy study in which 5 of 8 patients with G3 HCV did not respond whereas 3 of 8 patients did. The ""capture-fusion"" assay correctly identified responders.
CONCLUSION: The capture-fusion model represents a promising new technique that may help identify appropriate treatment strategies for patients with chronic HCV infection."

METHODS: Seventy-four patients were included, with liver biopsy and a 3 Tesla abdominal magnetic resonance imaging examination, with an IVIM diffusion-weighted sequence (single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequence, with gradient reversal fat suppression; 6 b-values: 0, 50, 200, 400, 600, and 800 s/mm2). Histological evaluation comprised the Ishak modified scale, for grading inflammation and fibrosis, plus steatosis and iron loading classification. The liver apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters (D, D*, f) were calculated from the IVIM images. The relationship between IVIM parameters and histopathological scores were evaluated by ANOVA and Spearman correlation tests. A test-retest experiment assessed reproducibility and repeatability in 10 healthy volunteers and 10 randomly selected patient studies.
RESULTS: ADC and f values were lower with higher fibrosis stages (p = 0.009, p = 0.006, respectively) and also with higher necro-inflammatory activity grades (p = 0.02, p = 0.017, respectively). Considered together, only fibrosis presented a significant effect on ADC and f measurements (p &lt; 0.05), whereas inflammation had no significant effect (p &gt; 0.05). A mild correlation was found between ADC and f with fibrosis (R <sub>S</sub> = -0.32 and R <sub>S</sub> = -0.38; p &lt; 0.05) and inflammation (R <sub>S</sub> = -0.31 and R <sub>S</sub> = -0.32, p &lt; 0.05; respectively). The AUROC for ADC and f measurements with the different dichotomizations between fibrosis or inflammation grades were only fair (0.670 to 0.749, p &lt; 0.05). Neither D nor D* values were significantly different between liver fibrosis or inflammation grades. D measurements were significantly different across histologic grades of steatosis (p &lt; 0.001) and iron overload (p &lt; 0.001), whereas f measurements showed significant differences across histologic steatosis grades (p = 0.005). There was an excellent agreement between the different readers for ADC, f, and D.
CONCLUSIONS: Although fibrosis presented a significant effect on ADC and f, IVIM measurements are not accurate enough to stage liver fibrosis or necro-inflammatory activity in diffuse liver diseases. D values were influenced by steatosis and iron overload."

One important distinction between these models is that the HM and the DM either assume or imply that accuracies and response times are independent given the latent trait variables, while the SM does not. In this paper we investigate the impact of this conditional independence property-or a lack thereof-on the manifest probability distribution for accuracies and response times. We will find that the manifest distributions of the latent trait models share several important features, such as the dependency between accuracy and response time, but we also find important differences, such as in what function of response time is being modeled. Our method for characterizing the manifest probability distributions is related to the Dutch identity (Holland in Psychometrika 55(6):5-18, 1990)."

Epub 2019 Jun 8.,Admiraal MM,Ann Neurol,2019,2019/05/25,PMC6618107,,10.1002/ana.25507,"OBJECTIVE: Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG-R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG-R using a standardized assessment.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG-R assessment protocol was executed twice per day in adult patients after CA. EEG-R was classified as present or absent by 3 EEG readers, blinded to patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as present. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) in 6 months after CA, dichotomized as good (CPC = 1-2) or poor (CPC = 3-5). EEG-R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥80% was used. Added value of EEG-R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).
RESULTS: Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG-R for poor outcome prediction had a specificity of 82% and a sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG-R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.
INTERPRETATION: EEG-R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction, it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination, and SSEPs. For prediction of good outcome, EEG-R seems to have added value.
