,Applications of Digital Microscopy and Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Quantitation of Babesia-Infected Erythrocytes,"Durant, T. J.; Dudgeon, S. N.; Mcpadden, J.; Simpson, A.; Price, N.; Schulz, W. L.; Torres, R.; Olson, E.",,,Pathology,2021,2021-04-29 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/2021.04.27.21256115,"BackgroundClinical babesiosis is diagnosed, and parasite burden is determined, by microscopic inspection of a thick or thin Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear. However, quantitative analysis by manual microscopy is subject to observer bias, slide distribution errors, statistical sampling error, recording errors, and is inherently burdensome from time management and workflow efficiency standpoints. As such, methods for the automated measurement of percent parasitemia in digital microscopic images of peripheral blood smears could improve clinical accuracy, relative to the predicate method.

MethodsIndividual erythrocyte images (shape: 70x70x3) were manually labeled as ""parasite"" or ""normal"" and were used to train a model for binary image classification. The best model was then used to calculate percent parasitemia from a clinical validation dataset, and values were compared to a clinical reference value. Lastly, model interpretability was examined using an integrated gradient to identify pixels most likely to influence classification decisions.

ResultsThe precision and recall of the model during development testing were 0.92 and 1.00, respectively. In clinical validation, the model returned increasing positive signal with increasing mean reference value. However, there were two highly erroneous false positive values returned by the model. Lastly, the model incorrectly assessed three cases well above the clinical threshold of 10%. The integrated gradient suggested potential sources of false positives including rouleaux formations, cell boundaries, and precipitate as deterministic factors in negative erythrocyte images.

ConclusionsWhile the model demonstrated highly accurate single cell classification and correctly assessed most slides, several false positives were highly incorrect. This project highlights the need for integrated testing of ML-based models, even when models in the development phase perform well.","Applications of Digital Microscopy and Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Quantitation of Babesia-Infected Erythrocytes BackgroundClinical babesiosis is diagnosed, and parasite burden is determined, by microscopic inspection of a thick or thin Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear.

,AI-DRIVEN QUANTIFICATION OF GROUND GLASS OPACITIES IN LUNGS OF COVID-19 PATIENTS USING 3D COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING,"Kalia, R. K.; Sharma, A.; Amin, S. B.; Saha, M.; Thittamaranahalli, S. K.",,,Epidemiology,2021,2021-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/2021.07.06.21260109,"ObjectivesGround-glass opacity (GGO) -- a hazy, gray appearing density on computed tomography (CT) of lungs -- is one of the hallmark features of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs.

MethodWe use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the ""MosMedData"", which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs.

ResultsPointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases.

ConclusionThe PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources.

Key PointsOur approach to GGO analysis has four distinguishing features:

O_LIWe combine an unsupervised computer vision approach with convex hull and convex points algorithms to segment and preserve the actual structure of the lung.
C_LIO_LITo the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to use PointNet++ architecture for 3D visualization, segmentation, classification, and pattern analysis of GGOs.

Methods35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020.

Results96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93.

We apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development.

MethodsWe construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the models transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) becomes less than one.

ResultsThe deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will become less than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to die out, and that the US ""Infected"" population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020 between 1{middle dot}34 million and 1{middle dot}41 million individual cases.

,A Multi-Task Pipeline with Specialized Streams forClassification and Segmentation of InfectionManifestations in COVID-19 Scans,"El-Bana, S.; Al-Kabbany, A.; Sharkas, M.",,,Epidemiology,2020,2020-06-26 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/2020.06.24.20139238,"We are concerned with the challenge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) detection in chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, and the classification and segmentation of related infection manifestations. Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations.

Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations.

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

DesignA convolutional neural network was trained on LUS images with B lines of different etiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set was compared to surveyed LUS-competent physicians.

SettingTwo tertiary Canadian hospitals.

Participants600 LUS videos (121,381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either 1) COVID-19, Non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) and 3) Hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE).

ResultsThe trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (AUC 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies. This was significantly better than physician ability (AUCs of 0.697, 0.704, 0.967 for the COVID, NCOVID and HPE classes, respectively), p < 0.01.

ConclusionsA deep learning model can distinguish similar appearing LUS pathology, including COVID-19, that cannot be distinguished by humans.

Leveraging fine-grained mobility data and computational models, we investigate two network effects--the ""hub effect"" (vaccinating mobility hubs reduces transmission) and the ""homophily effect"" (stronger homophily in vaccination rates increases transmission). Applying Bayesian deep learning and fine-grained epidemic simulations, our study suggests a negative effect of homophily and a positive effect of highly vaccinated hubs on reducing case counts for both the synthetic network and the U.S. mobility network. Our framework enables us to evaluate outcomes from various hypothetical spatial vaccine distributions and to study a hypothetical vaccination campaign strategy that targets a small number of regions with the largest gain in protective power using the data from January 2022.

,Cross-sectional Ct distributions from qPCR tests can provide an early warning signal for the spread of COVID-19 in communities,"Sharmin, M.; Manivannan, M.; Woo, D.; Sorel, O.; Auclair, J.; Gandhi, M.; Mujawar, I.",,,Epidemiology,2023,2023-01-14 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/2023.01.12.23284489,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 PCR testing data has been widely used for COVID-19 surveillance. Existing COVID-19 forecasting models mainly rely on case counts, even though the binary PCR results provide a limited picture of the pandemic trajectory. Most forecasting models have failed to accurately predict the COVID-19 waves before they occur. Recently a model utilizing cross-sectional population cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from PCR tests (Ct-based model) was developed to overcome the limitations of using only binary PCR results. In this study, we aimed to improve on COVID-19 forecasting models using features derived from the Ct-based model, to detect epidemic waves earlier than case-based trajectories.

MethodsPCR data was collected weekly at Northeastern University (NU) between August 2020 and January 2022. The NU campus epidemic trajectories were generated from the campus incidence rates. In addition, epidemic trajectories were generated for Suffolk County, where NU is located, based on publicly available case-counts. A novel forecasting approach was developed by enhancing a recent deep learning model with Ct-based features, along with the models default features. For this, cross-sectional Ct values from PCR data were used to generate Ct-based epidemic trajectories, including effective reproductive rate (Rt) and incidence. The improvement in forecasting performance was compared using absolute errors and residual squared errors with respect to actual observed cases at the 7-day and 14-day forecasting horizons. The model was also tested prospectively over the period January 2022 to April 2022.

ResultsRt estimates from the Ct-based model preceded NU campus and Suffolk County cases by 12 and 14 days respectively, with a three-way synched Spearman correlation of 0.57. Enhancing the forecasting models with Ct-based information significantly decreased absolute error and residual squared error compared to the original model without Ct features (p-value <0.001 for both 7 and 14-days forecasting horizons).

ConclusionCt-based epidemic trajectories can herald an earlier signal for impending epidemic waves in the community and forecast transmission peaks. Moreover, COVID-19 forecasting models can be enhanced using these Ct features to improve their forecasting accuracy.

Policy implicationsWe make the case that public health agencies should publish Ct values along with the binary positive/negative PCR results. Early and accurate forecasting of epidemic waves can inform public health policies and countermeasures which can mitigate spread.","Cross-sectional Ct distributions from qPCR tests can provide an early warning signal for the spread of COVID-19 in communities BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 PCR testing data has been widely used for COVID-19 surveillance. Existing COVID-19 forecasting models mainly rely on case counts, even though the binary PCR results provide a limited picture of the pandemic trajectory. Most forecasting models have failed to accurately predict the COVID-19 waves before they occur. Recently a model utilizing cross-sectional population cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from PCR tests (Ct-based model) was developed to overcome the limitations of using only binary PCR results. In this study, we aimed to improve on COVID-19 forecasting models using features derived from the Ct-based model, to detect epidemic waves earlier than case-based trajectories.

MethodsPCR data was collected weekly at Northeastern University (NU) between August 2020 and January 2022. The NU campus epidemic trajectories were generated from the campus incidence rates. In addition, epidemic trajectories were generated for Suffolk County, where NU is located, based on publicly available case-counts. A novel forecasting approach was developed by enhancing a recent deep learning model with Ct-based features, along with the models default features. For this, cross-sectional Ct values from PCR data were used to generate Ct-based epidemic trajectories, including effective reproductive rate (Rt) and incidence. The improvement in forecasting performance was compared using absolute errors and residual squared errors with respect to actual observed cases at the 7-day and 14-day forecasting horizons. The model was also tested prospectively over the period January 2022 to April 2022.

The presence of host barriers results in viral host tropism, where infected hosts are subject to strict restrictions due to the hindered spread of viruses across hosts. Therefore, the identification of host tropism of IAVs, particularly in humans, is crucial to preventing the cross-host transmission of avian viruses and their outbreaks in humans. Nevertheless, efficiently and effectively identifying host tropism, especially for early host susceptibility warnings based on viral genome sequences during outbreak onset, remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose Flu-CNN, a deep neural network model based on classical character-level convolutional networks. By analyzing the genomic segments of IAVs, Flu-CNN can accurately identify the host tropism, with a particular focus on avian influenza viruses that may infect humans. According to our experimental evaluations, Flu-CNN achieved an accuracy of 99% in identifying virus hosts via only a single genomic segment, even for subtypes with a relatively small number of viral strains such as H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. The superiority of Flu-CNN demonstrates its effectiveness in screening for critical amino acid mutations, which is important to host adaptation, and zoonotic risk prediction of viral strains. Flu-CNN is a valuable tool for identifying evolutionary characterization, monitoring potential outbreaks, and preventing epidemical spreads of IAVs, which contribute to the effective surveillance of influenza A viruses.","Flu-CNN: predicting host tropism of influenza A viruses via character-level convolutional networks Throughout history, Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused significant harm and catastrophic pandemics.

Moreover, short-term mortality risk reflects individual frailty and can serve as digital aging marker. Previous studies have focused on specific, high-risk populations. Predicting all-cause mortality in an unselected population incorporating both health and socioeconomic factors has direct public health relevance but requires careful fairness considerations.

MethodsWe developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (N = 5.4 million), including >8,000 features and spanning back up to 50 years. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a primary metric to assess model performance and fairness.

FindingsThe model achieved an AUC of 0.944 with strong calibration, outperforming a baseline model that only included age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC > 0.800 for 45 out of 50 causes), including COVID-19 which was not present in the training data. The model performed best among young females and worst in older males (AUC = 0.910 vs. AUC = 0.718). Extensive fairness analyses revealed that individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged groups had the worst model performance, not explained by age and sex differences, reduced healthcare contact, or smaller training set sizes within these groups.

ConclusionA deep learning model based on nationwide longitudinal multi-modal data accurately identified short-term mortality risk holding the potential for developing a population-wide in-silico aging marker.

Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT ""DeepPavlov"", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines. Examining the sentinel properties of participatory trials (which is subject to self-reporting biases) could still provide meaningful information about pharmaceutics, especially if only a limited amount of information on AEs is provided by producers.","Mild Adverse Events of Sputnik V Vaccine Extracted from Russian Language Telegram Posts via BERT Deep Learning Model BackgroundThere is a limited amount of data on the COVID-19 vector vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) safety profile.

The success of these measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance has not been complete. Detailed data is required on the factors aiding or hindering compliance with these measures.

MethodsTo understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020.

ResultsThe main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to ones self and ones family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved one, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family.

ConclusionThe results demonstrate an array of factors contribute to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communications that emphasizes the potential risks of COVID-19 and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours.","Facilitators and Barriers to Compliance with COVID-19 Guidelines: A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data from 17,500 UK Adults BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has implemented a series of guidelines, rules, and restrictions to change citizens behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus, such as the promotion of face-masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders.

There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).

ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21).

The best predictive performance was obtained by the support vector machines algorithm (AUC: 0.85; Sensitivity: 0.68; Specificity: 0.85; Brier Score: 0.16). The three most important variables for the predictive performance of the algorithm were the number of lymphocytes, leukocytes and eosinophils, respectively.

Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted.

MethodsWe propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (ML-Sim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data.

FindingsMLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of Chinas mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones.

To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in Chinas mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12.

These future predictions help the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public health policymakers after understanding the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid forecasting model that can generate real-time out-of-sample forecasts of COVID-19 outbreaks for five profoundly affected countries, namely the USA, Brazil, India, UK, and Canada. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta method and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is developed. Daily new cases of COVID-19 are nonlinear, non-stationary, and volatile; thus a single specific model cannot be ideal for future prediction of the pandemic. However, the newly introduced hybrid forecasting model with an acceptable prediction error rate can help healthcare and government for effective planning and resource allocation.

On top of that transmission rate may vary widely in a large region due to non-stationarity of spatial features which poses difficulty in creating a global model. We modified discrete global Susceptible-Infected-Removed model by using time varying transmission rate, recovery rate and multiple spatially local models. No specific functional form of transmission rate has been assumed. We have derived the criteria for disease-free equilibrium within a specific time period. A single Convolutional LSTM model is created and trained to map multiple spatiotemporal features to transmission rate. The model achieved 8.39% mean absolute percent error in terms of cumulative infection cases in each locality in a 10-day prediction period. Local interpretations of the model using perturbation method reveals local influence of different features on transmission rate which in turn is used to generate a set of generalized global interpretations. A what-if scenario with modified recovery rate illustrates rapid dampening of the spread when forecasted with the trained model.

In particular, it is imperative to address the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To address this question, we have developed a novel Covid-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of quarantine strength to the infection timeseries, allowing us to quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further, our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown without early reopening, the number of active infected cases recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than 40% in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100, 000 for the states of Florida and Texas.

The results of our experiments using the Canadian dataset show that the ensemble model performs well in comparison to other models. In addition, this research provides us with a new outcome regarding the dynamic correlation between temperature, humidity and daily test data and its impact on the new contaminated cases.",Epidemiology

Prediction models for child pneumonia mortality have been developed using regression methods but their performance is insufficient for clinical use.

MethodsWe used a variety of machine learning methods to develop a predictive model for mortality in children with clinical pneumonia enrolled in population-based surveillance in the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Gambia (n=11,012). Four machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, artifical neural network, and regularized logistic regression) were implemented, fitting all possible combinations of two or more of 16 selected features. Models were shortlisted based on their training set performance, the number of included features, and the reliability of feature measurement. The final model was selected considering its clinical interpretability.

ResultsWhen we applied the final model to the test set (55 deaths), the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve was 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.84, 0.91), sensitivity was 0.78 and specificity was 0.77.

ConclusionsOur evaluation of multiple machine learning methods combined with minimal and pragmatic feature selection led to a predictive model with very good performance.

Whether CNNs could also inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 analysing street images has been understudied, though it could identify high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. We trained CNNs to classify bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk.

MethodsWe used five images per bus stop. The outcome label (moderate or extreme) for each bus stop was extracted from the local transport authority. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2, and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing network which was further tuned to increase performance.

ResultsThere were 1,788 bus stops (1,173 moderate and 615 extreme), totalling 8,940 images. NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the extreme label: 57% versus 59% in NASNetLarge and ResNet152V2, respectively. NASNetLarge was further tuned and reached: training loss of 0.50; training accuracy of 75%; precision, recall and F1 score for the moderate label of 80%, 83% and 82%, respectively; these metrics for the extreme label were 65%, 51% and 63%.

In this study, we set out to develop a high content image analysis workflow to quantify features of H&E images from HPV+OpSCC patients to identify prognostic features which can be used for prediction of patient outcomes.

MethodsWe have developed a dedicated image analysis workflow using open-source software, for single-cell segmentation and classification. This workflow was applied to a set of 567 images from diagnostic H&E slides in a retrospective cohort of HPV+OpSCC patients with favourable (n = 29) and unfavourable (n = 29) outcomes. Using our method, we have identified 31 quantitative prognostic features which were quantified in each sample and used to train a neural network model to predict patient outcomes. The model was validated by k-fold cross-validation using 10 folds and a test set.

ResultsUnivariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the two patient outcome groups in 31 and 16 variables respectively (P<0.05). The neural network model had an overall accuracy of 78.8% and 77.7% in recognising favourable and unfavourable prognosis patients when applied to the test set and k-fold cross-validation respectively.

Transmission to humans involves freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, which are particularly prevalent in developing countries where dams and water resource projects have expanded freshwater snail habitat. At our study sites in the lower Senegal River Basin, we have collected more than 5,500 images of the 7 freshwater snail species (grouped into 4 categories) most frequently encountered in this aquatic ecosystem, 5 of which amplify and transmit either urinary or intestinal human schistosomiasis, with the other 2 species responsible for the transmission of less common parasitic diseases of humans and/or livestock. We have also collected over 5,100 images of 11 classes of trematodes, including human and non-human schistosomes. It takes a great deal of training and expertise to accurately classify these organisms morphologically. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly efficient for image recognition tasks across many object categories. Here we demonstrate classification capacity for snail and parasite images and test our models performance against 8 highly-trained human parasitologists with experience taxonomically classifying snail and parasite species from the Senegal River Basin in West Africa. We establish and train a single CNN end-to-end directly from images with only pixels and labels as inputs. Applying this state-of-the-art algorithm, we are able to classify images of 4 snail categories with 99.64% accuracy and images of 11 parasite categories with 88.14% accuracy, which rivals highly-trained human parasitologists. The trained algorithm could next be deployed to mobile devices for use in remote field settings by local technicians, and significantly improve monitoring snail and parasite occurrence in the field for disease control purposes.\n\nAuthor SummarySchistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) infecting over 250 million people worldwide. The current approach to mitigate this disease in endemic regions is community or school-based mass drug administration. However, parasites are primarily transmitted through environmental reservoirs where freshwater snails serve as intermediate hosts. People use the contaminated water sources for their daily tasks and get re-infected after drug treatment. Therefore, drug administration alone is not effective for schistosomiasis control in such high transmission settings. Recent studies show that snail population control is essential to reduce disease transmission risks. To discern between parasitic worms of humans in snails and those of other non-human species is a necessary step to precisely quantify transmission risk for human schistosomiasis. However, it takes a great deal of expertise to train lab and field technicians to accurately classify snail and parasite species. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered computer vision algorithms have recently proven to be highly efficient for image recognition tasks. We have collected thousands of snail and parasite images in Senegal during 2015-2018. Using these images as training data, we developed an AI model that classifies images of 4 snail categories and 11 parasite categories with, in some cases, higher accuracy than well-trained human parasitologists.

At our study sites in the lower Senegal River Basin, we have collected more than 5,500 images of the 7 freshwater snail species (grouped into 4 categories) most frequently encountered in this aquatic ecosystem, 5 of which amplify and transmit either urinary or intestinal human schistosomiasis, with the other 2 species responsible for the transmission of less common parasitic diseases of humans and/or livestock. We have also collected over 5,100 images of 11 classes of trematodes, including human and non-human schistosomes. It takes a great deal of training and expertise to accurately classify these organisms morphologically. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly efficient for image recognition tasks across many object categories. Here we demonstrate classification capacity for snail and parasite images and test our models performance against 8 highly-trained human parasitologists with experience taxonomically classifying snail and parasite species from the Senegal River Basin in West Africa. We establish and train a single CNN end-to-end directly from images with only pixels and labels as inputs. Applying this state-of-the-art algorithm, we are able to classify images of 4 snail categories with 99.64% accuracy and images of 11 parasite categories with 88.14% accuracy, which rivals highly-trained human parasitologists. The trained algorithm could next be deployed to mobile devices for use in remote field settings by local technicians, and significantly improve monitoring snail and parasite occurrence in the field for disease control purposes.\n\nAuthor SummarySchistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) infecting over 250 million people worldwide. The current approach to mitigate this disease in endemic regions is community or school-based mass drug administration. However, parasites are primarily transmitted through environmental reservoirs where freshwater snails serve as intermediate hosts. People use the contaminated water sources for their daily tasks and get re-infected after drug treatment. Therefore, drug administration alone is not effective for schistosomiasis control in such high transmission settings. Recent studies show that snail population control is essential to reduce disease transmission risks. To discern between parasitic worms of humans in snails and those of other non-human species is a necessary step to precisely quantify transmission risk for human schistosomiasis. However, it takes a great deal of expertise to train lab and field technicians to accurately classify snail and parasite species. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered computer vision algorithms have recently proven to be highly efficient for image recognition tasks. We have collected thousands of snail and parasite images in Senegal during 2015-2018. Using these images as training data, we developed an AI model that classifies images of 4 snail categories and 11 parasite categories with, in some cases, higher accuracy than well-trained human parasitologists. This model could next be deployed to mobile devices for use in remote field settings to support local technicians to identify transmission hotspots and target control.",Bioinformatics

Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins.

We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus-Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.

We trained and tested DeepHBV using the HBV integration sites data from dsVIS database. Initially, DeepHBV showed AUROC of 0.6363 and AUPR of 0.5471 on the dataset.

On independent validation dataset of HBV integration sites from VISDB, DeepHBV with HBV integration sequences plus TCGA Pan Cancer (AUROC of 0.7603 and AUPR of 0.6189) performed better than HBV integration sequences plus repeat peaks (AUROC of 0.6657 and AUPR of 0.5737).

We aimed to investigate deep learning-based machine learning algorithms to classify COVID-19 related publications to help scale-up the epidemiological curation process.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, five different pre-trained deep learning-based language models were fine-tuned on a dataset of 6,365 publications manually classified into two classes, three subclasses and 22 sub-subclasses relevant for epidemiological triage purposes. In a k-fold cross-validation setting, each standalone model was assessed on a classification task and compared against an ensemble, which takes the standalone model predictions as input and uses different strategies to infer the optimal article class.

ResultsThe ensemble model significantly outperformed the standalone classifiers, achieving a F1-score of 89.2 at the class level of the classification task.

In China, DF expanded from coastal region to inner land, and the incidence sharply increased in the last few years. In this study, we conduct the analysis of dengue using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. This is an artificial intelligence technology, to develop a precise dengue forecast model.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe model is developed from monthly dengue cases and local meteorological data of 2005-2018 among top 20 Chinese cities with a record of the highest dengue incidence. The first 13 year data were used to construct the LSTM and to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018. The results are compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models. Model performance and prediction accuracy were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). With the LSTM method, the prediction measurements of average RMSE drop by 54.79% and 34.76% as compared with the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model and Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Model (ZIGAM). Our results showed that if only local data were used to develop forecast models, the LSTM neural networks would fail to capture the transmission characteristics of dengue virus in areas with fewer dengue cases. Contrarily, transfer learning (TL) can improve the accuracy of prediction of the LSTM neural network model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.\n\nConclusion and significanceThe LSTM model is beneficial in predicting dengue incidence as compared with other previously published forecasting models. The findings provide a more precise forecast dengue model, which can help the local government and health-related departments respond early to dengue epidemics.\n\nAuthor summaryIn China, DF is a public health concern that poses a great economic burden on local governments. However, the incidence has sharply increased in recent years with growth in the sub-regions. With this issue, it will be challenging to develop an accurate and timely dengue forecast model. LSTM recurrent neural networks, deep learning methods and virus propagation rules by learning from observational data offer more advantages in predicting the prevalence of infectious disease dynamics than the traditional statistical model. The 2005-2017 data of the top 20 Chinese cities with the highest dengue incidence were used to construct the LSTM model, advantageous in predicting dengue in most cities. Moreover, the model helped to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018 and used to compare the estimated dengue cases with the RMSE results of other previously published models. A thorough search of the literature shows that this is the first established dengue forecast model using the LSTM method, which is effective in predicting the trend of dengue dynamics.","Developing a dengue forecast model using Long Short Term Memory neural networks method BackgroundDengue Fever (DF) is a tropical mosquito-borne disease that threatens public health and causes enormous economic burdens worldwide.

This is an artificial intelligence technology, to develop a precise dengue forecast model.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe model is developed from monthly dengue cases and local meteorological data of 2005-2018 among top 20 Chinese cities with a record of the highest dengue incidence. The first 13 year data were used to construct the LSTM and to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018. The results are compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models. Model performance and prediction accuracy were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). With the LSTM method, the prediction measurements of average RMSE drop by 54.79% and 34.76% as compared with the Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model and Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Model (ZIGAM). Our results showed that if only local data were used to develop forecast models, the LSTM neural networks would fail to capture the transmission characteristics of dengue virus in areas with fewer dengue cases. Contrarily, transfer learning (TL) can improve the accuracy of prediction of the LSTM neural network model in areas with fewer dengue incidences.\n\nConclusion and significanceThe LSTM model is beneficial in predicting dengue incidence as compared with other previously published forecasting models. The findings provide a more precise forecast dengue model, which can help the local government and health-related departments respond early to dengue epidemics.\n\nAuthor summaryIn China, DF is a public health concern that poses a great economic burden on local governments. However, the incidence has sharply increased in recent years with growth in the sub-regions. With this issue, it will be challenging to develop an accurate and timely dengue forecast model. LSTM recurrent neural networks, deep learning methods and virus propagation rules by learning from observational data offer more advantages in predicting the prevalence of infectious disease dynamics than the traditional statistical model. The 2005-2017 data of the top 20 Chinese cities with the highest dengue incidence were used to construct the LSTM model, advantageous in predicting dengue in most cities. Moreover, the model helped to predict the dengue outbreaks in 2018 and used to compare the estimated dengue cases with the RMSE results of other previously published models. A thorough search of the literature shows that this is the first established dengue forecast model using the LSTM method, which is effective in predicting the trend of dengue dynamics.",Bioinformatics

Epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition is a key factor in determining the T-cell immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 epitope. Although several data-driven methods for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition have been proposed, they remain challenging owing to the enormous diversity of TCRs and the lack of available training data.

In order to develop effective drugs and vaccines, one needs to efficiently simulate SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) mutations and identify high-risk variants. We pretrain a large protein language model with approximately 408 million protein sequences and construct a high-throughput screening for the prediction of binding affinity and antibody escape. As the first work on SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutation simulation, we successfully identify mutations in the RBD regions of 5 VOCs and can screen millions of potential variants in seconds. Our workflow scales to 4096 NPUs with 96.5% scalability and 493.9x speedup in mixed precision computing, while achieving a peak performance of 366.8 PFLOPS (reaching 34.9% theoretical peak) on Pengcheng Cloudbrain-II.

,Adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to biofilm growth is genetically linked to drug tolerance,"Richards, J. P.; Cai, W.; Zill, N. A.; Zhang, W.; Ojha, A. K.",,,Microbiology,2019,2019-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/663369,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) spontaneously grows at the air-medium interface forming pellicle biofilms, which harbor more drug tolerant persisters than planktonic cultures. The underlying basis for increased persisters in Mtb biofilms is unknown. Using a Tn-seq approach, we show here that multiple genes that are necessary for fitness of Mtb cells within biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures, are also important for their tolerance to a diverse set of stressors and antibiotics. Thus, development of Mtb biofilms appears to be associated with population enrichment, in which endogenous stresses presumably generated by challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain tolerance to exogenous stresses including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of biofilms determines the frequency of persisters: morphologically indistinguishable monoculture biofilms of a {Delta}pstC2A1 mutant hypersensitive to rifampicin harbor [~]20-fold fewer persisters than wild-type. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development significantly contributes to the persister frequency. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLP). Mutation analysis indicates that INLP is necessary for the architecture development of Mtb biofilms. In summary, the study offers an insight into persistence of Mtb biofilms under antibiotic exposure, while identifying INLP as a biomarker for further investigation of this phenomenon.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe tuberculosis (TB) pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the deadliest bacterial pathogens known to mankind, and TB treatment is inefficient. A lengthy chemotherapy for TB is attributed to a small subpopulation of Mtb bacilli exhibiting phenotypic tolerance to antibiotics. Drugs targeting these persisters are expected to shorten TB chemotherapy, but their development is dependent on in vitro growth models that reproducibly generate high frequency of persisters. Biofilms of Mtb are a suitable model for understanding the origin of persisters. Here, we provide an explanation for the elevated persister frequency in Mtb biofilms. We also identify isonitrile lipopetides as a biomarker of Mtb biofilms. These findings will facilitate further advancements of our efforts to identify and target Mtb persisters.","Adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to biofilm growth is genetically linked to drug tolerance Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) spontaneously grows at the air-medium interface forming pellicle biofilms, which harbor more drug tolerant persisters than planktonic cultures. The underlying basis for increased persisters in Mtb biofilms is unknown. Using a Tn-seq approach, we show here that multiple genes that are necessary for fitness of Mtb cells within biofilms, but not in planktonic cultures, are also important for their tolerance to a diverse set of stressors and antibiotics. Thus, development of Mtb biofilms appears to be associated with population enrichment, in which endogenous stresses presumably generated by challenging growth conditions within biofilm architecture select for cells that maintain tolerance to exogenous stresses including antibiotic exposure. We further observed that the intrinsic drug tolerance of constituent cells of biofilms determines the frequency of persisters: morphologically indistinguishable monoculture biofilms of a {Delta}pstC2A1 mutant hypersensitive to rifampicin harbor [~]20-fold fewer persisters than wild-type. These findings together allow us to propose that the selection of elite cells during biofilm development significantly contributes to the persister frequency. Furthermore, probing the possibility that the population enrichment is an outcome of unique environment within biofilms, we demonstrate biofilm-specific induction in the synthesis of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLP). Mutation analysis indicates that INLP is necessary for the architecture development of Mtb biofilms. In summary, the study offers an insight into persistence of Mtb biofilms under antibiotic exposure, while identifying INLP as a biomarker for further investigation of this phenomenon.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe tuberculosis (TB) pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the deadliest bacterial pathogens known to mankind, and TB treatment is inefficient.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a dataset of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural networks based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.","Plant phenology supports the multi-emergence hypothesis for Ebola spillover events Ebola virus disease outbreaks in animals (including humans and great apes) start with sporadic host switches from unknown reservoir species.

In this study, two sets of RF models were developed for the national and departmental levels in Colombia to predict weekly dengue cases at 12-weeks ahead. A national model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) was also developed and used as a comparator to the RF models. The various predictors included historic dengue cases, satellite-derived estimates for vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature, population counts, income inequality, and education. Our RF model trained on the national data was more accurate for department-specific weekly dengue cases estimation compared to a local model trained only on the departments data. Additionally, the forecast errors of the national RF model were smaller to those of the national ANN model and were increased with the forecast horizon increasing from one-week ahead (mean absolute error, MAE: 5.80; root mean squared error, RMSE: 11.10) to 12-weeks ahead (MAE: 13.38; RMSE: 26.82). There was considerable variation in the relative importance of predictors dependent on forecast horizon. The environmental and meteorological predictors were relatively important for short-term dengue forecast horizons while socio-demographic predictors were relevant for longer-term forecast horizons. This study showed the potential of RF in dengue forecasting with also demonstrating the feasibility of using a national model to forecast at finer spatial scales. Furthermore, sociodemographic predictors are important to include to capture longer-term trends in dengue.

In this study, we compare two different machine learning approaches to dengue forecasting: random forest (RF) and neural networks (NN). National and local (departmental-level) models were compared and used to predict dengue cases in the future. The results showed that the counts of future dengue cases were more accurately estimated by RF than by NN. It was also shown that environmental and meteorological predictors were more important for forecast accuracy for shorter-term forecasts while socio-demographic predictors were more important for longer-term forecasts. Finally, the national model applied to local data was more accurate in dengue forecasting compared to the local model.

In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases to humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to very few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes.

Methods and resultsIn this study, we train artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9 {+/-} 2.8% (N=927), 68.7 {+/-} 4.8% (N=140), 80.3 {+/-} 2.0% (N=158), and 75.7 {+/-} 2.5% (N=298), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1 {+/-} 2.2%, (N=927), 89.8 {+/-} 1.7% (N=140), 93.3 {+/-} 1.2% (N=158), and 92.7 {+/-} 1.8% (N=298) accuracies for Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively.

ConclusionThese results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique compared to ovary dissections.","An Autoencoder and Artificial Neural Network-based Method to Estimate Parity Status of Wild Mosquitoes from Near-infrared Spectra BackgroundAfter mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs.

Here, we combined analyses of diverse sequences and structures of coronavirus spikes with data from deep mutational scanning to design SARS-CoV-2 variant antigens containing the most significant mutations that may emerge. We trained a neural network to predict RBD expression and ACE2 binding from sequence, which allowed us to determine that these antigens are stable and bind to ACE2. Thus, they represent viable variants. We then used a computational model of affinity maturation (AM) to study the antibody response to immunization with different combinations of the designed antigens. The results suggest that immunization with a cocktail of the antigens is likely to promote evolution of higher titers of antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 variants than immunization or infection with the wildtype virus alone. Finally, our analysis of 12 coronaviruses from different genera identified the S2 cleavage site and fusion peptide as potential pan-coronavirus vaccine targets.

Rather than using a reactive approach to vaccine development that would lag behind the evolution of the virus, such as updating the sequence in the vaccine with a current variant, we sought to use a proactive approach that predicts some of the mutations that could arise that could evade current immune responses.

In this study, we used a combination of conventional and advanced neural network-based in silico approaches to predict how these mutations would affect the spike protein. The results demonstrated a decrease in the electrostatic potentials of residues corresponding to receptor recognition sites, an increase in the alkalinity of the protein, a change in hydrophobicity, variations in functional residues, and an increase in the percentage of alpha-helix structure. Our next step was to predict the structural changes of the spike protein using the AI-based tool Alphafold2 and dock it with hACE2. The results revealed that the RBD of the Omicron variant had a higher affinity than the reference. Moreover, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations concluded that the RBD of the Omicron variant exhibits a more dispersed interaction network since mutations resulted in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with hACE2 compared to the reference RBD.

Deep learning methods have been used to model protein sequences for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A few significant drawbacks in these studies include being deficient in modelling end-to-end protein sequences, modelling only those genomic positions that show high activity and upsampling the number of sequences at each genomic position for balancing the frequency of mutations. To mitigate such drawbacks, the current approach uses a generative model, an encoder-decoder neural network, to learn the natural progression of spike protein sequences through adjacent clades of the phylogenetic tree of Nextstrain clades. Encoder transforms a set of spike protein sequences from the source clade (20A) into its latent representation. Decoder uses the latent representation, along with Gaussian distributed noise, to generate a different set of protein sequences that are closer to the target clade (20B). The source and target clades are adjacent nodes in the phylogenetic tree of different evolving clades of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sequences of amino acids are generated, for the entire length, at each genomic position using the latent representation of the amino acid generated at a previous step. Using trained models, protein sequences from the source clade are used to generate sequences that form a collection of evolved sequences belonging to all children clades of the source clade. A comparison of this predicted evolution (between source and generated sequences) of proteins with the true evolution (between source and target sequences) shows a high pearson correlation (> 0.7). Moreover, the distribution of the frequencies of substitutions per genomic position, including high- and low-frequency positions, in source-target sequences and source-generated sequences exhibit a high resemblance (pearson correlation > 0.7). In addition, the model partially predicts a few substitutions at specific genomic positions for the sequences of unseen clades (20J (Gamma)) where they show little activity during training. These outcomes show the potential of this approach in learning the latent mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences.

Cross- attention PHV outperformed existing state-of-the-art models using a benchmark dataset and accurately predicted PPIs for unknown viruses. Cross-attention PHV also predicted human-SARS-CoV-2 PPIs with area under the curve values >0.95.",Bioinformatics

Despite their lower disease severity, they can reinfect COVID-19 patients and infect vaccinated individuals as well. The high number of mutations in these variants render them resistant to antibodies that otherwise neutralize the spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recent research has shown that despite its strong immune evasion, Omicron still induces strong T Cell responses similar to the original variant. This work investigates the molecular basis for this observation using the neural network tools NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCiipan-4.0. The antigens presented through the MHC Class I and Class II pathways from all the notable SARS-CoV-2 variants were compared across numerous high frequency HLAs. All variants were observed to have equivalent T cell antigenicity. A novel positive control system was engineered in the form of spike variants that did evade T Cell responses, unlike Omicron. These evasive spike proteins were used to statistically confirm that the Omicron variants did not exhibit lower antigenicity in the MHC pathways. These results suggest that T Cell immunity mounts a strong defense against COVID-19 which is difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to overcome through mere evolution.

Here, we address the challenge of identifying non-human animal coronaviruses that may infect humans by creating an artificial neural network model that learns from the binding of the spike protein of alpha and beta coronaviruses to their host receptor. The proposed method produces a human-Binding Potential (h-BiP) score that distinguishes, with high accuracy, the binding potential among human coronaviruses. Two viruses, previously unknown to bind human receptors, were identified: Bat coronavirus BtCoV/133/2005 (a MERS related virus) and Rhinolophus affinis coronavirus isolate LYRa3 a SARS related virus. We further analyze the binding properties of these viruses using molecular dynamics. To test whether this model can be used for surveillance of novel coronaviruses, we re-trained the model on a set that excludes SARS-COV-2 viral sequences.

The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate, ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the relative size of the high risk group, and iii) prediction forecast window (one up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future.\n\nResultsThe model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas. The model performance is quantitatively evaluated based on the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that the model can accurately predict the geographic expansion of Zika in the Americas with the overall average accuracy remaining above 85% even for prediction windows of up to 12 weeks.\n\nConclusionsSensitivity analysis illustrated the model performance to be robust across a range of features.

The problem is solely regarded as a time series forecasting problem ignoring the known epidemiology of dengue fever as well as the other meteorological variables. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a popular classical time series model for linear data structures whereas with the advent of neural networks, nonlinear structures in the dataset can be handled. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model combining ARIMA and neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model to capture both linearity and nonlinearity in the datasets. The ARIMA model filters out linear tendencies in the data and passes on the residual values to the NNAR model. The proposed hybrid approach is applied to three dengue time-series data sets and is found to give better forecasting accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art.

The ability to generate large metagenomic assemblies of mixed microbial and viral sequences provides the opportunity to tease apart complex microbiome dynamics, but these analyses are currently limited by the tools available for analyses of viral genomes and assessing their metabolic impacts on microbiomes.

DesignHere we present VIBRANT, the first method to utilize a hybrid machine learning and protein similarity approach that is not reliant on sequence features for automated recovery and annotation of viruses, determination of genome quality and completeness, and characterization of virome function from metagenomic assemblies. VIBRANT uses neural networks of protein signatures and a novel v-score metric that circumvents traditional boundaries to maximize identification of lytic viral genomes and integrated proviruses, including highly diverse viruses. VIBRANT highlights viral auxiliary metabolic genes and metabolic pathways, thereby serving as a user-friendly platform for evaluating virome function. VIBRANT was trained and validated on reference virus datasets as well as microbiome and virome data.

ResultsVIBRANT showed superior performance in recovering higher quality viruses and concurrently reduced the false identification of non-viral genome fragments in comparison to other virus identification programs, specifically VirSorter and VirFinder. When applied to 120,834 metagenomically derived viral sequences representing several human and natural environments, VIBRANT recovered an average of 94.5% of the viruses, whereas VirFinder and VirSorter achieved less powerful performance, averaging 48.1% and 56.0%, respectively. Similarly, VIBRANT identified more total viral sequence and proteins when applied to real metagenomes. When compared to PHASTER and Prophage Hunter for the ability to extract integrated provirus regions from host scaffolds, VIBRANT performed comparably and even identified proviruses that the other programs did not. To demonstrate applications of VIBRANT, we studied viromes associated with Crohns Disease to show that specific viral groups, namely Enterobacteriales-like viruses, as well as putative dysbiosis associated viral proteins are more abundant compared to healthy individuals, providing a possible viral link to maintenance of diseased states.

ConclusionsThe ability to accurately recover viruses and explore viral impacts on microbial community metabolism will greatly advance our understanding of microbiomes, host-microbe interactions and ecosystem dynamics.","VIBRANT: Automated recovery, annotation and curation of microbial viruses, and evaluation of virome function from genomic sequences BackgroundViruses are central to microbial community structure in all environments.

Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections.

Microarray analysis was carried out using CHIKV strain (Prototype and Indian) infected Vero cells and two host isozymes, MK2 and MK3 were selected for further analysis. Gene silencing and drug treatment were performed in vitro and in vivo to unravel the role of MK2/MK3 in CHIKV infection. Gene silencing of MK2 and MK3 abrogated around 58% CHIKV progeny release from the host cell and a MK2 activation (a) inhibitor (CMPD1) treatment demonstrated 68% inhibition of viral infection suggesting a major role of MAPKAPKs during the late phase of CHIKV infection in vitro. Further, it was observed that the inhibition in viral infection is primarily due to the abrogation of lamellipodium formation through modulation of factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells. Moreover, CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice demonstrated reduction in the viral copy number, lessened disease score and better survivability after CMPD1 treatment. In addition, reduction in expression of key pro-inflammatory mediators such as CXCL13, RAGE, FGF, MMP9 and increase in HGF (a CHIKV infection recovery marker) was observed indicating the effectiveness of this drug against CHIKV. Additionally, CMPD1 also inhibited HSV1 and SARS CoV2-19 infection in vitro.

Although, studies have been undertaken to combat the disease still there are no effective strategies like vaccines or antivirals against it. Therefore it is essential to understand the virus and host interaction to overcome this hurdle. In this study two host factors MK2 and MK3 have been taken into consideration to see how they regulate the multiplication of the virus. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that inhibition of MK2 and MK3 restricted viral infection Further, it was observed that this is due to the blocking of lamellipodium formation by modifying the factors involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that is responsible for releasing the virus from the infected cells.

These are typically measured empirically by offering mosquitoes an infectious bloodmeal and temporally sampling mosquitoes to determine infection and transmission status. This approach has been used for the better part of a century; however, it does not accurately capture the biology and behavior of many mosquito vectors which refeed frequently (every 2-3 days)4. Here we demonstrate that administration of a second non-infectious bloodmeal significantly shortens the EIP of ZIKV-infected Ae. aegypti by enhancing virus escape from the mosquito midgut. Similarly, a second bloodmeal increased the competence of this species for dengue virus and CHIKV. This effect was also observed for ZIKV in Aedes albopictus, suggesting that this species might be a more important vector than once thought and that this phenomenon may be common among other virus-vector pairings. Modeling of these findings reveals that a shortened EIP would result in a significant increase in the basic reproductive number, R0. This increase helps explain how Ae.aegypti can sustain an explosive epidemic like ZIKV despite its relatively poor vector competence in single-feed laboratory trials. Together, these data demonstrate a direct and unrecognized link between mosquito feeding behavior, EIP, and vector competence.","SUCCESSIVE BLOODMEALS ENHANCE VIRUS DISSEMINATION WITHIN MOSQUITOES AND INCREASE TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL SUMMARY PARAGRAPHThe recent Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) epidemics highlight the explosive nature of arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes1,2.

Despite this, knowledge regarding pathogenesis, characteristics of host immune response, and resolution of MAYV infections are still limited. Here we investigated the dependence of age, innate and adaptive immunity for the control of MAYV replication and induction of inflammation in mice. We observed that age and type I interferon response are related to restriction of MAYV infection and tissue inflammation in mice. Moreover, we showed that MAYV continues to replicate persistently in adult recombination activation gene-1 efficient mice (RAG1-/-), indicating that adaptive immunity is essential to MAYV clearance. Despite chronic replication, infected adult RAG1-/- mice did not develop an apparent signal of muscle damage at late infection. On the other hand, MAYV infection induces muscular and paw inflammation in young WT and adult Type I Interferon receptor deficient mice (IFNAR-/-). In addition, MAYV infection triggers an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF, IL-6, KC, IL-1{beta}, MCP-1, and RANTES, in muscle tissue, and decreases TGF-{beta} expression. Taken together, our study contributes to the comprehension of MAYV pathogenesis, and describes a translational mouse model for further studies of MAYV infection, as well for testing vaccine and therapeutic strategies against this virus.\n\nAuthor SummaryMAYV-induced disease presents a high prevalence of arthralgia and myalgia that potentially persist for months, which is characteristic of the arthritogenic Alphavirus group. However, information regarding MAYV infection and the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis is still scarce. Here we investigated the dependence of age, innate and adaptive immunity for the control of MAYV replication and induction of inflammation in mice. We observed that tissue inflammation and the restriction of MAYV replication in mice are affected by aging and type I interferon response. Besides, we also showed that adaptive immunity was important for MAYV clearance in adult mice. Histological analyses demonstrated that MAYV replication triggered muscular and paw inflammation in young WT and adult type-I interferon receptor deficient mice. In addition, the level of expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in the muscle MAYV-infected mice. Our data provide an advance for understanding the molecular mechanism involved in MAYV pathogenesis, as well as describes an in vivo model for further investigations on MAYV infection and for antiviral compounds and vaccine testing.","Mayaro virus replication restriction and induction of muscular inflammation in mice are dependent on age and type-I interferon response Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emergent Arbovirus belonging to the Alphavirus genus from the Togaviridae family which has been circulated in forest regions of American continent through small outbreaks.

,Agricultural and geographic factors shaped the North American 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 outbreak,"Hicks, J.; Lee, D.-H.; Duvvuri, V.; Kim Torchetti, M.; Swayne, D.; Bahl, J.",,,Epidemiology,2019,2019-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/645408,"The 2014 - 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models modified to incorporate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models constructed in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, a continuous external source of virus was not needed to explain the propagation of HPAI cases within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance, road density and proportion of water coverage were all supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 3.0). Together these findings indicate that the midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry sectors and geographic factors.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak among poultry farms in the midwestern United States appears to be influenced by agricultural and geographic factors. After initial introduction of the virus into the poultry industries, no further introductions (such as from a wild bird reservoir) were necessary to explain the continuation of the outbreak from March to June 2015. Additionally, evidence suggests that proximity increases the chances of viral movement between two locations. While many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the transmission of virus among poultry farms, the support for road density as an important driver of viral movement suggests human-mediated viral transportation played a key role in the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreak in North America.","Agricultural and geographic factors shaped the North American 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 outbreak The 2014 - 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date.

,A porcine ex vivo lung perfusion model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis,"Dumigan, A.; Fitzgerald, M.; Sa-Pessoa, J.; Hamid, U.; O'kane, C.; Mcauley, D. F.; Bengoechea, J. A.",,,Microbiology,2019,2019-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,,,10.1101/708503,"The use of animal infection models is essential to understand microbial pathogenesis and to develop and test treatments. Insects, and 2D and 3D tissue models are increasingly being used as surrogate for mammalian models. However, there are concerns whether these models recapitulate the complexity of host-pathogen interactions. Here, we developed the ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model of infection using porcine lungs to investigate Klebsiella pneumoniae-triggered pneumonia as model of respiratory infections. The porcine EVLP model recapitulates features of K. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia lung injury. This model is also useful to assess the pathogenic potential of K. pneumoniae as we observed that the attenuated Klebsiella capsule mutant strain caused less pathological tissue damage with a concomitant decrease in the bacterial burden compare to lungs infected with the wild type. The porcine EVLP model allows assessment of inflammatory responses following infection; similar to the mouse pneumonia model, we observed an increase of il-10 in the lungs infected with the wild type and an increase of ifn-{gamma} in lungs infected with the capsule mutant. This model also allows monitoring phenotypes at the single-cell level. Wild-type K. pneumoniae skews macrophages towards an M2-like state. In vitro experiments probing pig bone marrow-derived macrophages uncovered the role of the M2 transcriptional factor STAT6, and that Klebsiella-induced il10 expression is controlled by p38 and ERK. Klebsiella-induced macrophage polarization is dependent on the capsule. Altogether, this study support the utility of the EVLP model using pig lungs as platform to investigate the infection biology of respiratory pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe implementation of infection models that approximate human disease is essential to understand infections and for testing new therapies before they enter into clinical stages. Rodents are used in most of pre-clinical studies, although the differences between mouse and man have fuelled the conclusion that murine studies are unreliable predictors of human outcomes. Here, we have developed a whole lung porcine model of infection using the established ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) system established to re-condition human lungs for transplant. As a proof-of-principle, we provide evidence demonstrating that infection of the porcine EVLP with the human pathogen K. pneumoniae recapitulates the known features of Klebsiella-triggered pneumonia. Moreover, our data revealed the porcine EVLP model is useful to reveal features of the virulence of K. pneumoniae including the manipulation of immune cells. Altogether, this study supports the utility of the EVLP model using pig lungs as surrogate host for assessing respiratory infections.","A porcine ex vivo lung perfusion model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis The use of animal infection models is essential to understand microbial pathogenesis and to develop and test treatments.
