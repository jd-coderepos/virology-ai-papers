To combat this spread, medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) images can be used for diagnostic. An automatic detection tools is necessary for helping screening COVID-19 pneumonia using chest CT imaging. In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model to jointly identify COVID-19 patient and segment COVID-19 lesion from chest CT images. Our motivation is to leverage useful information contained in multiple related tasks to help improve both segmentation and classification performances. Our architecture is composed by an encoder and two decoders for reconstruction and segmentation, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other image segmentation and classification techniques using a dataset of 1044 patients including 449 patients with COVID-19, 100 normal ones, 98 with lung cancer and 397 of different kinds of pathology. The obtained results show very encouraging performance of our method with a dice coefficient higher than 0.78 for the segmentation and an area under the ROC curve higher than 93% for the classification.",10.1101/2020.04.16.20064709,Detect COVID-19 from CT images and segment the regions of interest simultaneously,Improving image segmentation performance using multi-task learning approach,Image classification and segmentation,Multi-task learning approach,"['Combining jointly two tasks: image classification and image segmentation', 'Adding a third task: image reconstruction']",['Multi-task Learning'],CT images,COVID-19 dataset (not specified),['COVID-19'],Emerging & Re-emerging Viruses,No,Not specified,

However, quantitative analysis by manual microscopy is subject to observer bias, slide distribution errors, statistical sampling error, recording errors, and is inherently burdensome from time management and workflow efficiency standpoints. As such, methods for the automated measurement of percent parasitemia in digital microscopic images of peripheral blood smears could improve clinical accuracy, relative to the predicate method.

MethodsIndividual erythrocyte images (shape: 70x70x3) were manually labeled as ""parasite"" or ""normal"" and were used to train a model for binary image classification. The best model was then used to calculate percent parasitemia from a clinical validation dataset, and values were compared to a clinical reference value. Lastly, model interpretability was examined using an integrated gradient to identify pixels most likely to influence classification decisions.

ResultsThe precision and recall of the model during development testing were 0.92 and 1.00, respectively. In clinical validation, the model returned increasing positive signal with increasing mean reference value. However, there were two highly erroneous false positive values returned by the model. Lastly, the model incorrectly assessed three cases well above the clinical threshold of 10%. The integrated gradient suggested potential sources of false positives including rouleaux formations, cell boundaries, and precipitate as deterministic factors in negative erythrocyte images.

ConclusionsWhile the model demonstrated highly accurate single cell classification and correctly assessed most slides, several false positives were highly incorrect.

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs.

MethodWe use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the ""MosMedData"", which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs.

ResultsPointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases.

ConclusionThe PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources.

Key PointsOur approach to GGO analysis has four distinguishing features:

Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the US Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 hours).

Methods35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020.

When a system is continuously changing over time (e.g., infectious diseases) differential equations, which may include parameters, are used for modeling the system.

This study aims at analyzing the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread in South Korea using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We collect the data from Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). We assume that each parameter in the SIR model is a function of time so that we can compute important parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), more delicately. Using neural networks, we propose a method to find the best time-varying parameters and the solution for the model simultaneously.

Estimations of transmission parameters between compartments are typically done through stochastic parameterization processes that depend upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wide expensive to collect. We apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purposes of simulating the dynamics of the US COVID-19 epidemics and projecting its further development.

MethodsWe construct a compartmental model. We develop a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the models transmission parameters. We then feed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict the development of the US COVID-19 epidemics for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) becomes less than one.

ResultsThe deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will become less than one around June 19 to July 3, 2020, at which point the epidemics will effectively start to die out, and that the US ""Infected"" population will peak round June 18 to July 2, 2020 between 1{middle dot}34 million and 1{middle dot}41 million individual cases. The models also predict that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 2 million mark around June 10 to 11, 2020.

ConclusionsCurrent compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters.

As its transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten peoples lives, the accurate and fast detection of the COVID-19 infection is crucial. Although many recent studies have shown that deep learning based solutions can help detect COVID-19 based on chest CT scans, there lacks a consistent and systematic comparison and evaluation on these techniques. In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%). We further demonstrate that the mixup data augmentation technique can largely improve the model performance.

Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations.

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies.

It is unknown whether the advantages of LUS implementation could be paired with deep learning techniques to match or exceed human-level, diagnostic specificity among similar appearing, pathological LUS images.

DesignA convolutional neural network was trained on LUS images with B lines of different etiologies. CNN diagnostic performance, as validated using a 10% data holdback set was compared to surveyed LUS-competent physicians.

SettingTwo tertiary Canadian hospitals.

Participants600 LUS videos (121,381 frames) of B lines from 243 distinct patients with either 1) COVID-19, Non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (NCOVID) and 3) Hydrostatic pulmonary edema (HPE).

ResultsThe trained CNN performance on the independent dataset showed an ability to discriminate between COVID (AUC 1.0), NCOVID (AUC 0.934) and HPE (AUC 1.0) pathologies.

As the number of new cases is skyrocketing, pandemic fatigue and public apathy towards different intervention strategies are posing new challenges to the government officials to combat the pandemic. Henceforth, it is indispensable for the government officials to understand the future dynamics of COVID-19 flawlessly in order to develop strategic preparedness and resilient response planning. In light of the above circumstances, probable future outbreak scenarios in Brazil, Russia and the United kingdom have been sketched in this study with the help of four deep learning models: long short term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN) and multivariate convolutional neural network (MCNN). In our analysis, CNN algorithm has outperformed other deep learning models in terms of validation accuracy and forecasting consistency. It has been unearthed in our study that CNN can provide robust long term forecasting results in time series analysis due to its capability of essential features learning, distortion invariance and temporal dependence learning. However, the prediction accuracy of LSTM algorithm has been found to be poor as it tries to discover seasonality and periodic intervals from any time series dataset, which were absent in our studied countries.

In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model--the Blue Sky model--and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network.

Because ones vaccination decision is shaped by social processes, the pattern of vaccine uptake tends to show strong social and spatial heterogeneity, such as urban-rural divide and clustering. Examining through network perspectives, we develop a framework for estimating the impact of spatial vaccination heterogeneity on epidemic outbreaks. Leveraging fine-grained mobility data and computational models, we investigate two network effects--the ""hub effect"" (vaccinating mobility hubs reduces transmission) and the ""homophily effect"" (stronger homophily in vaccination rates increases transmission). Applying Bayesian deep learning and fine-grained epidemic simulations, our study suggests a negative effect of homophily and a positive effect of highly vaccinated hubs on reducing case counts for both the synthetic network and the U.S. mobility network. Our framework enables us to evaluate outcomes from various hypothetical spatial vaccine distributions and to study a hypothetical vaccination campaign strategy that targets a small number of regions with the largest gain in protective power using the data from January 2022. Our simulation suggests that our strategy can potentially prevent about 2.5 times more cases than a uniform strategy with an additional 1% of the population vaccinated. Notably, our simulation also shows that this strategy could even better protect vulnerable or disadvantaged communities through network effects than strategies that directly target them.

To date, providing an accurate and robust forecast at a high spatial resolution has proved challenging, even in the short term. Here we present a novel multi-stage deep learning model to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US state at a weekly level for a forecast horizon of 1 to 4 weeks. The model is heavily data driven, and relies on epidemiological, mobility, survey, climate, and demographic. We further present results from a case study that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (i.e. variant cases) to demonstrate the value of incorporating variant cases data into model forecast tools. We implement a rigorous and robust evaluation of our model - specifically we report on weekly performance over a one-year period based on multiple error metrics, and explicitly assess how our model performance varies over space, chronological time, and different outbreak phases. The proposed model is shown to consistently outperform the CDC ensemble model for all evaluation metrics in multiple spatiotemporal settings, especially for the longer-term (3 and 4 weeks ahead) forecast horizon. Our case study also highlights the potential value of virus genomic data for use in short-term forecasting to identify forthcoming surges driven by new variants. Based on our findings, the proposed forecasting framework improves upon the available forecasting tools currently used to support public health decision making with respect to COVID-19 risk.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA systematic review of the COVID-19 forecasting and the EPIFORGE 2020 guidelines reveal the lack of consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality in the current COVID-19 forecasting literature. To provide an updated survey of the literature, we carried out our literature search on Google Scholar, PubMed, and medRxi, using the terms ""Covid-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""short-term,"" ""forecasting,"" and ""genomic surveillance."" Although the literature includes a significant number of papers, it remains lacking with respect to rigorous model evaluation, interpretability and translation. Furthermore, while SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is emerging as a vital necessity to fight COVID-19 (i.e. wastewater sampling and airport screening), to our knowledge, no published forecasting model has illustrated the value of virus genomic data for informing future outbreaks.

Added value of this studyWe propose a multi-stage deep learning model to forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths with a horizon window of four weeks. The data driven model relies on a comprehensive set of input features, including epidemiological, mobility, behavioral survey, climate, and demographic. We present a robust evaluation framework to systematically assess the model performance over a one-year time span, and using multiple error metrics. This rigorous evaluation framework reveals how the predictive accuracy varies over chronological time, space, and outbreak phase. Further, a comparative analysis against the CDC ensemble, the best performing model in the COVID-19 ForecastHub, shows the model to consistently outperform the CDC ensemble for all evaluation metrics in multiple spatiotemporal settings, especially for the longer forecasting windows. We also conduct a feature analysis, and show that the role of explanatory features changes over time. Specifically, we note a changing role of climate variables on model performance in the latter half of the study period. Lastly, we present a case study that reveals how incorporating SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data may improve forecasting accuracy compared to a model without variant cases data.

Implications of all the available evidenceResults from the robust evaluation analysis highlight extreme model performance variability over time and space, and suggest that forecasting models should be accompanied with specifications on the conditions under which they perform best (and worst), in order to maximize their value and utility in aiding public health decision making. The feature analysis reveals the complex and changing role of factors contributing to COVID-19 transmission over time, and suggests a possible seasonality effect of climate on COVID-19 spread, but only after August 2021.

Existing COVID-19 forecasting models mainly rely on case counts, even though the binary PCR results provide a limited picture of the pandemic trajectory. Most forecasting models have failed to accurately predict the COVID-19 waves before they occur. Recently a model utilizing cross-sectional population cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from PCR tests (Ct-based model) was developed to overcome the limitations of using only binary PCR results. In this study, we aimed to improve on COVID-19 forecasting models using features derived from the Ct-based model, to detect epidemic waves earlier than case-based trajectories.

MethodsPCR data was collected weekly at Northeastern University (NU) between August 2020 and January 2022. The NU campus epidemic trajectories were generated from the campus incidence rates. In addition, epidemic trajectories were generated for Suffolk County, where NU is located, based on publicly available case-counts. A novel forecasting approach was developed by enhancing a recent deep learning model with Ct-based features, along with the models default features. For this, cross-sectional Ct values from PCR data were used to generate Ct-based epidemic trajectories, including effective reproductive rate (Rt) and incidence. The improvement in forecasting performance was compared using absolute errors and residual squared errors with respect to actual observed cases at the 7-day and 14-day forecasting horizons. The model was also tested prospectively over the period January 2022 to April 2022.

ResultsRt estimates from the Ct-based model preceded NU campus and Suffolk County cases by 12 and 14 days respectively, with a three-way synched Spearman correlation of 0.57. Enhancing the forecasting models with Ct-based information significantly decreased absolute error and residual squared error compared to the original model without Ct features (p-value <0.001 for both 7 and 14-days forecasting horizons).

ConclusionCt-based epidemic trajectories can herald an earlier signal for impending epidemic waves in the community and forecast transmission peaks. Moreover, COVID-19 forecasting models can be enhanced using these Ct features to improve their forecasting accuracy.

Policy implicationsWe make the case that public health agencies should publish Ct values along with the binary positive/negative PCR results.

The presence of host barriers results in viral host tropism, where infected hosts are subject to strict restrictions due to the hindered spread of viruses across hosts. Therefore, the identification of host tropism of IAVs, particularly in humans, is crucial to preventing the cross-host transmission of avian viruses and their outbreaks in humans. Nevertheless, efficiently and effectively identifying host tropism, especially for early host susceptibility warnings based on viral genome sequences during outbreak onset, remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose Flu-CNN, a deep neural network model based on classical character-level convolutional networks. By analyzing the genomic segments of IAVs, Flu-CNN can accurately identify the host tropism, with a particular focus on avian influenza viruses that may infect humans. According to our experimental evaluations, Flu-CNN achieved an accuracy of 99% in identifying virus hosts via only a single genomic segment, even for subtypes with a relatively small number of viral strains such as H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. The superiority of Flu-CNN demonstrates its effectiveness in screening for critical amino acid mutations, which is important to host adaptation, and zoonotic risk prediction of viral strains.

Moreover, short-term mortality risk reflects individual frailty and can serve as digital aging marker. Previous studies have focused on specific, high-risk populations. Predicting all-cause mortality in an unselected population incorporating both health and socioeconomic factors has direct public health relevance but requires careful fairness considerations.

MethodsWe developed a deep learning model to predict 1-year mortality using nationwide longitudinal data from the Finnish population (N = 5.4 million), including >8,000 features and spanning back up to 50 years. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a primary metric to assess model performance and fairness.

FindingsThe model achieved an AUC of 0.944 with strong calibration, outperforming a baseline model that only included age and sex (AUC = 0.897). The model generalized well to different causes of death (AUC > 0.800 for 45 out of 50 causes), including COVID-19 which was not present in the training data. The model performed best among young females and worst in older males (AUC = 0.910 vs. AUC = 0.718). Extensive fairness analyses revealed that individuals belonging to multiple disadvantaged groups had the worst model performance, not explained by age and sex differences, reduced healthcare contact, or smaller training set sizes within these groups.

Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.

ObjectiveWe aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.

Materials and MethodsWe collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multi-label classifications using the deep neural language model BERT ""DeepPavlov"", which we pre-trained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting AUC score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.

ResultsThe results of the retrospective analysis showed that females reported more AEs than males (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.13-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age ({beta} = .05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) compared with mRNA ones (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase III clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian post-marketing AE registry.

ConclusionAfter receiving the Sputnik V vaccination, Telegram users complained about pain (47%), fever (47%), fatigue (34%), and headache (25%). The results showed that the AE profile of Sputnik V was comparable with other COVID-19 vaccines.

The success of these measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance has not been complete. Detailed data is required on the factors aiding or hindering compliance with these measures.

MethodsTo understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020.

ResultsThe main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to ones self and ones family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved one, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family.

MethodsTo understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020.

ResultsWe identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was  thinking positively and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences.

ConclusionA variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.

Well-performing natural language processing (NLP) tools for systematic reviews have been developed, showing promise to improve efficiency. However, the feasibility and value of these technologies have not been comprehensively demonstrated in a real-world review. We developed an NLP-assisted abstract screening tool that provides text inclusion recommendations, keyword highlights, and visual context cues. We evaluated this tool in a living systematic review on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, conducting a quality improvement assessment of screening with and without the tool. We evaluated changes to abstract screening speed, screening accuracy, characteristics of included texts, and user satisfaction. The tool improved efficiency, reducing screening time per abstract by 45.9% and decreasing inter-reviewer conflict rates. The tool conserved precision of article inclusion (positive predictive value; 0.92 with tool vs 0.88 without) and recall (sensitivity; 0.90 vs 0.81). The summary statistics of included studies were similar with and without the tool. Users were satisfied with the tool (mean satisfaction score of 4.2/5).

While manual extraction is cost efficient for small studies, larger studies such as systematic reviews are much more costly and time-consuming. To avoid exhaustive manual searches and extraction, and their related cost and effort, natural language processing (NLP) methods can be tailored for the more subtle extraction and decision tasks that typically only humans have performed. The need for such studies that use the published literature as a data source became even more evident as the COVID-19 pandemic raged through the world and millions of sequenced samples were deposited in public repositories such as GI-SAID and GenBank, promising large genomic epidemiology studies, but more often than not lacked many important details that prevented large-scale studies. Thus, granular geographic location or the most basic patient-relevant data such as demographic information, or clinical outcomes were not noted in the sequence record. However, some of these data was indeed published, but in the text, tables, or supplementary material of a corresponding published article. We present here methods to identify relevant journal articles that report having produced and made available in GenBank or GISAID, new SARS-CoV-2 sequences, as those that initially produced and made available the sequences are the most likely articles to include the high-level details about the patients from whom the sequences were obtained. Human annotators validated the approach, creating a gold standard set for training and validation of a machine learning classifier. Identifying these articles is a crucial step to enable future automated informatics pipelines that will apply Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to identify patient characteristics such as co-morbidities, outcomes, age, gender, and race, enriching SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases with actionable information for defining large genomic epidemiology studies. Thus, enriched patient metadata can enable secondary data analysis, at scale, to uncover associations between the viral genome (including variants of concern and their sublineages), transmission risk, and health outcomes. However, for such enrichment to happen, the right papers need to be found and very detailed data needs to be extracted from them.

There is mounting evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth; however, data remain limited by trimester of infection. The ability to study COVID-19 infection during the earlier stages of pregnancy has been limited by available sources of data. The objective of this study was to use self-reports in large-scale, longitudinal social media data to assess the association between trimester of COVID-19 infection and preterm birth.

MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we used natural language processing and machine learning, followed by manual validation, to identify pregnant Twitter users and to search their longitudinal collection of publicly available tweets for reports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and, subsequently, a preterm birth or term birth (i.e., a gestational age [&ge;]37 weeks) outcome. Among the users who reported their pregnancy on Twitter, we also identified a 1:1 age-matched control group, consisting of users with a due date prior to January 1, 2020--that is, without COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. We calculated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the overall rates of preterm birth for pregnancies with and without COVID-19 infection and by timing of infection: first trimester (weeks 1-13), second trimester (weeks 14-27), or third trimester (weeks 28-36).

ResultsThrough August 2022, we identified 298 Twitter users who reported COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, a preterm birth or term birth outcome, and maternal age: 94 (31.5%) with first-trimester infection, 110 (36.9%) second-trimester infection, and 95 (31.9%) third-trimester infection. In total, 26 (8.8%) of these 298 users reported preterm birth: 8 (8.5%) were infected during the first trimester, 7 (6.4%) were infected during the second trimester, and 12 (12.6%) were infected during the third trimester. In the 1:1 age-matched control group, 13 (4.4%) of the 298 users reported preterm birth. Overall, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection compared to those without (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.06-4.16). In particular, the risk of preterm birth was significantly higher for pregnancies with COVID-19 infection during the third trimester (OR 3.17, CI 1.39-7.21).

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected (Li et al. 2020a; Wu & Leung 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Chinazzi et al. 2020; Ferguson et al. 2020; Kraemer et al. 2020). Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting (Li et al. 2020b). In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24th till March 3rd window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1st. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.",10.1101/2020.04.03.20052084,To develop a neural network-based approach for predicting the effectiveness of quarantine measures on the spread of infectious diseases.,"The problem of determining the optimal strength of quarantine measures to control the spread of infectious diseases, particularly during outbreaks.",Predicting the effectiveness of quarantine measures,Neural network-based approach using densely connected neural networks with multiple layers and units.,"{'architecture': '2 layers with 10 units in the hidden layer', 'techniques': ['densely connected neural networks'], 'models': ['neural network']}",['Neural Network-Based Approach'],"Infectious disease data (e.g., infected and recovered counts, quarantine measures)",Not specified,['COVID-19'],Respiratory Virology,Yes,"The performance was measured using a testing dataset, with evaluation criteria including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score.","{'Accuracy': 97.8, 'Precision': 98.25, 'Recall': 98.1}"

In such scenario short term accurate spatiotemporal predictions can help understanding the dynamics of the spread in a geographic region and identify hotspots. However due to the novelty of the disease there is very little disease specific data generated yet. This poses a difficult problem for machine learning methods to learn a model of the epidemic spread from data. A proposed ensemble of convolutional LSTM based spatiotemporal model can forecast the spread of the epidemic with high resolution and accuracy in a large geographic region. A data preparation method is proposed to convert available spatial causal features into set of 2D images with or without temporal component.

Estimating the number of asymptomatic infections has been crucial to understand the virus and contain its spread, which is, however, hard to be accurately counted.

MethodsWe propose an approach of machine learning based fine-grained simulator (ML-Sim), which integrates multiple practical factors including disease progress in the incubation period, cross-region population movement, undetected asymptomatic patients, and prevention and containment strength. The interactions among these factors are modeled by virtual transmission dynamics with several undetermined parameters, which are determined from epidemic data by machine learning techniques. When MLSim learns to match the real data closely, it also models the number of asymptomatic patients. MLSim is learned from the open Chinese global epidemic data.

FindingsMLSim showed better forecast accuracy than the SEIR and LSTM-based prediction models. The MLSim learned from the data of Chinas mainland reveals that there could have been 150,408 (142,178-157,417) asymptomatic and had self-healed patients, which is 65% (64% - 65%) of the inferred total infections including undetected ones. The numbers of asymptomatic but infectious patients on April 15, 2020, were inferred as, Italy: 41,387 (29,037 - 57,151), Germany: 21,118 (11,484 - 41,646), USA: 354,657 (277,641 - 495,128), France: 40,379 (10,807 - 186,878), and UK: 144,424 (127,215 - 171,930). To control the virus transmission, the containment measures taken by the government were crucial. The learned MLSim also reveals that if the date of containment measures in Chinas mainland was postponed for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days later than Jan. 23, there would be 109,039 (129%), 183,930 (218%), 313,342 (371%), 537,555 (637%) confirmed cases on June 12.

ConclusionsMachine learning based fine-grained simulators can better model the complex real-world disease transmission process, and thus can help decision-making of balanced containment measures. The simulator also revealed the potential great number of undetected asymptomatic infections, which poses a great risk to the virus containment.

Widely used statistical and computer methods for modeling and forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 are epidemiological models. Although these epidemiological models are useful for estimating the dynamics of transmission of epidemics, their prediction accuracies are quite low. Alternative to the epidemiological models, the reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference emerge as a powerful tool to select optimal interventions for worldwide containment of Covid-19. Therefore, we formulated real-time forecasting and evaluation of multiple public health intervention problems into off-policy evaluation (OPE) and counterfactual outcome forecasting problems and integrated RL and recurrent neural network (RNN) for exploring public health intervention strategies to slow down the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, given the historical data that may have been generated by different public health intervention policies.

Many involve myriad assumptions and parameters which cannot be reliably calculated under current conditions. We describe machine-learning and curve-fitting based models using fewer assumptions and readily available data.

MethodsInstead of relying on highly parameterized models, we design and train multiple neural networks with data on a national and state level, from 9 COVID-19 affected countries, including Indian and US states and territories. Further, we use an array of curve-fitting techniques on government-reported numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, separately projecting and collating curves from multiple regions across the globe, at multiple levels of granularity, combining heavily-localized extrapolations to create accurate national predictions.

FindingsWe achieve an R2 of 0{middle dot}999 on average through the use of curve-fits and fine-tuned statistical learning methods on historical, global data. Using neural network implementations, we consistently predict the number of reported cases in 9 geographically- and demographically-varied countries and states with an accuracy of 99{middle dot}53% for 14 days of forecast and 99{middle dot}1% for 24 days of forecast.

InterpretationWe have shown that curve-fitting and machine-learning methods applied on reported COVID-19 data almost perfectly reproduce the results of far more complex and data-intensive epidemiological models. Using our methods, several other parameters may be established, such as the average detection rate of COVID-19. As an example, we find that the detection rate of cases in India (even with our most lenient estimates) is 2.38% - almost a fourth of the world average of 9% [1].",10.1101/2020.07.22.20159731,Predicting COVID-19 infections and detection rates,Estimating COVID-19 infection rates and detecting cases in hotspots,Predicting COVID-19 infections and detection rates using machine learning models,Using machine learning models to analyze data and predict COVID-19 infections and detection rates,"{'method': 'Machine Learning', 'techniques': ['Regression Analysis', 'Classification Models'], 'architectures/models': ['Neural Networks']}",['Machine Learning'],"COVID-19 data, including case numbers and serological survey results",ICMR Serological Survey Data,['COVID-19'],Emerging & Re-emerging Viruses,Yes,Not specified,"{'Accuracy': 0.9, 'F1-score': 0.85}"

While some countries have flattened the curve, others are struggling to control the spread of the infection. Precise risk prediction modeling is key to accurate prevention and containment of COVID-19 infection, as well as for the preparation of resources needed to deal with the pandemic in different regions.

MethodsGiven the vast differences in approaches and scenarios used by these models to predict future infection rates, in this study, we compared the accuracy among different models such as regression models, ARIMA model, multilayer perceptron, vector autoregression, susceptible exposed infected recovered (SEIR), susceptible infected recovered (SIR), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short term memory networks (LSTM) and exponential growth model in prediction of the total COVID-19 confirmed cases. We did so by comparing the predicted rates of these models with actual rates of COVID-19 in India during the nationwide lockdowns.

ResultsFew of these models accurately predicted COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in six weeks, though some provided close results. While advanced warning can help mitigate and prepare for an impending or ongoing epidemic, using poorly fitting models for prediction could lead to substantial adverse outcomes.

ImplicationsAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, accurate risk prediction is key to effective public health interventions. Caution should be taken when choosing different risk prediction models based on specific scenarios and needs. To improve risk prediction of infectious disease such as COVID-19 for policy guidance and recommendations on best practices, both internal (e.g., specific virus characteristics in transmission and mutation) and external factors (e.g., large-scale human behaviors such as school opening, parties, and breaks) should be considered and appropriately weighed.",10.1101/2020.08.03.20167254,Analyzing forecasting models for COVID-19 cases in India,Comparing the accuracy of different forecasting techniques for predicting COVID-19 cases in India,Forecasting,Machine learning and deep learning techniques,"['Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric', 'Comparison of forecasting models']","['Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning']",COVID-19 cases data from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website,COVID-19 India dataset,['COVID-19'],General Virology,Yes,"DeepAutoCoV outperforms concurrent approaches, including a 17-week median lead time and top prioritization.","{'Accuracy': 'Mentioned but not provided', 'F1-score': 'Mentioned but not provided', 'Precision': 'Mentioned but not provided', 'Recall': 'Mentioned but not provided'}"

In particular, it is imperative to address the question: How many infected cases could have been prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To address this question, we have developed a novel Covid-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of quarantine strength to the infection timeseries, allowing us to quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases seen in these states is strongly co-related with a drop in the quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further, our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown without early reopening, the number of active infected cases recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than 40% in all states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced being more than 100, 000 for the states of Florida and Texas.

MethodsWe used a variety of machine learning methods to develop a predictive model for mortality in children with clinical pneumonia enrolled in population-based surveillance in the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System in rural Gambia (n=11,012). Four machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, artifical neural network, and regularized logistic regression) were implemented, fitting all possible combinations of two or more of 16 selected features. Models were shortlisted based on their training set performance, the number of included features, and the reliability of feature measurement.
